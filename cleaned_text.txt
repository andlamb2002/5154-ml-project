the thousand guilders none seeing the humble supper eaten in the brinker cottage that night would have dreamed of the dainty repast hidden away nearby hans and gretel looked rather wistfully toward the cupboard as they drank their cupful of water and ate their scanty share of black bread but even in thought they did not rob their father he relished his supper well said dame brinker nodding sidewise toward the bed and fell asleep the next moment ah the dear man will be feeble for many a day he wanted sore to sit up again but while i made show of humoring him and getting ready he dropped off remember that my girl when you have a man of your own and many a day may it be before that comes to pass remember that you can never rule by differing humble wife is boss tut tut never swallow such a mouthful as that again child why i could make a meal off two such pieces in thee hans one would think there were cobwebs on the walls oh no mother i was only thinking thinking about what ah no use asking she added in a changed tone i was thinking of the same a while ago well no blame if we did look to hear something by this time about the thousand guilders but not a word no plain enough he knows naught about them hans looked up anxiously dreading lest his mother should grow agitated as usual when speaking of the lost money but she was silently nibbling her bread and looking with a doleful stare toward the window thousand guilders echoed a faint voice from the bed ah i am sure they have been of good use to you vrouw through the long years when your man was idle the poor woman started up these words quite destroyed the hope that of late had been glowing within her are you awake raff she faltered yes meitje and i feel much better our money was well saved vrouw i was saying did it last through all those ten years i i have not got it raff i she was going to tell him the whole truth when hans lifted his finger warningly and whispered remember what the meester told us the father must not be worried speak to him child she answered trembling hans hurried to the bedside i am glad you are feeling better he said leaning over his father another day will see you quite strong again aye like enough how long did the money last hans i could not hear your mother what did she say i said raff stammered dame brinker in great distress that it was all gone well well wife do not

brinker lifting her apron to her eyes tut tut woman why do you cry said raff kindly we will soon fill another pouch when i am on my feet again lucky i told you all about it before i fell told me what man why that i buried the money in my dream just now it seemed that i had never said aught about it dame brinker started forward hans caught her arm hist mother he whispered hastily leading her away we must be very careful then while she stood with clasped hands waiting in breathless anxiety he once more approached the cot trembling with eagerness he said that was a troublesome dream do you remember when you buried the money father yes my boy it was just before daylight on the same day i was hurt jan kamphuisen said something the sundown before that made me distrust his honesty he was the only one living besides mother who knew that we had saved a thousand guilders so i rose up that night and buried the money blockhead that i was ever to suspect an old friend be bound father pursued hans in a laughing voice motioning to his mother and gretel to remain quiet that forgotten where you buried it ha ha not i indeed but good night my son i can sleep again hans would have walked away but his gestures were not to be disobeyed so he said gently good night father where did you say you buried the money i was only a little one then close by the willow sapling behind the cottage said raff brinker drowsily ah yes north side of the tree it father no the south side ah you know the spot well enough you rogue like enough you were there when your mother lifted it now son easy shift this pillow so good night good night father said hans ready to dance for joy the moon rose very late that night shining in full and clear at the little window but its beams did not disturb raff brinker he slept soundly so did gretel as for hans and his mother they had something else to do after making a few hurried preparations they stole forth with bright expectant faces bearing a broken spade and a rusty implement that had done many a service when raff was a hale worker on the dikes contents on the river iss under the mountains the temple of the sun the secret tower on the kaolian road a hero in kaol new allies through the carrion caves with the yellow men in durance the pity of plenty follow the rope the magnet switch the tide of battle rewards the new ruler on the river iss in the shadows of the forest that flanks the crimson plain by the side of the lost sea of korus in the valley dor beneath the hurtling moons of mars speeding their meteoric way close above the bosom of the dying planet i crept stealthily along the trail of a shadowy form that hugged the darker places with a persistency that proclaimed the sinister nature of its errand for six long martian months i had haunted the vicinity of the hateful temple of the sun within whose shaft far beneath the surface of mars my princess lay entombed but whether alive or dead i knew not had phaidor's slim blade found that beloved heart time only would reveal the truth six hundred and martian days must come and go before the cell's door would again come opposite the tunnel's end where last i had seen my dejah thoris half of them had passed or would on the morrow yet vivid in my memory obliterating every event that had come before or after there remained the last scene before the gust of smoke blinded my eyes and the narrow slit that had given me sight of the interior of her cell closed between me and the princess of helium for a long martian year as if it were yesterday i still saw the beautiful face of phaidor daughter of matai shang distorted with jealous rage and hatred as she sprang forward with raised dagger upon the woman i loved i saw the red girl thuvia of ptarth leap forward to prevent the hideous deed the smoke from the burning temple had come then to blot out the tragedy but in my ears rang the single shriek as the knife fell then silence and when the smoke had cleared the revolving temple had shut off all sight or sound from the chamber in which the three beautiful women were imprisoned much there had been to occupy my attention since that terrible moment but never for an instant had the memory of the thing faded and all the time that i could spare from the numerous duties that had devolved upon me in the reconstruction of the government of the first born since our victorious fleet and land forces had overwhelmed them had been spent close to the grim shaft that held the mother of my boy carthoris of helium the race of blacks that for ages had worshiped issus the false deity of mars had been left in a state of chaos by my revealment of her as naught more than a wicked old woman in their rage they had torn her to pieces from the high pinnacle of their egotism the first born had been plunged to the depths of humiliation their deity was gone and with her the whole false fabric of their religion their vaunted navy had fallen in defeat before the superior ships and fighting men of the red men of helium fierce green warriors from the ocher sea bottoms of outer mars had ridden their wild thoats across the sacred gardens of the temple of issus and tars tarkas jeddak of thark fiercest of them all had sat upon the throne of issus and ruled the first born while the allies were deciding the conquered nation's fate almost unanimous was the request that i ascend the ancient throne of the black men even the first born themselves concurring in it but i would have none of it my heart could never be with the race that had heaped indignities upon my princess and my son at my suggestion xodar became jeddak of the first born he had been a dator or prince until issus had degraded him so that his fitness for the high office bestowed was unquestioned the peace of the valley dor thus assured the green warriors dispersed to their desolate sea bottoms while we of helium returned to our own country here again was a throne offered me since no word had been received from the missing jeddak of helium tardos mors grandfather of dejah thoris or his son mors kajak jed of helium her father over a year had elapsed since they had set out to explore the northern hemisphere in search of carthoris and at last their disheartened people had accepted as truth the vague rumors of their death that had filtered in from the frozen region of the pole once again i refused a throne for i would not believe that the mighty tardos mors or his no less redoubtable son was dead let one of their own blood rule you until they return i said to the assembled

you to believe this story nor could you wonder had you witnessed a recent experience of mine when in the armor of blissful and stupendous ignorance i gaily narrated the gist of it to a fellow of the royal geological society on the occasion of my last trip to london you would surely have thought that i had been detected in no less a heinous crime than the purloining of the crown jewels from the tower or putting poison in the coffee of his majesty the king the erudite gentleman in whom i confided congealed before i was half through it is all that saved him from exploding and my dreams of an honorary fellowship gold medals and a niche in the hall of fame faded into the thin cold air of his arctic atmosphere but i believe the story and so would you and so would the learned fellow of the royal geological society had you and he heard it from the lips of the man who told it to me had you seen as i did the fire of truth in those gray eyes had you felt the ring of sincerity in that quiet voice had you realized the pathos of it all you too would believe you would not have needed the final ocular proof that i had the weird creature which he had brought back with him from the inner world i came upon him quite suddenly and no less unexpectedly upon the rim of the great sahara desert he was standing before a tent amidst a clump of date palms within a tiny oasis close by was an arab douar of some eight or ten tents i had come down from the north to hunt lion my party consisted of a dozen children of the desert i was the only white man as we approached the little clump of verdure i saw the man come from his tent and with eyes peer intently at us at sight of me he advanced rapidly to meet us a white man he cried may the good lord be praised i have been watching you for hours hoping against hope that this time there would be a white man tell me the date what year is it and when i had told him he staggered as though he had been struck full in the face so that he was compelled to grasp my stirrup leather for support it cannot be he cried after a moment it cannot be tell me that you are mistaken or that you are but joking i am telling you the truth my friend i replied why should i deceive a stranger or attempt to in so simple a matter as the date for some time he stood in silence with bowed head ten years he murmured at last ten years and i thought that at the most it could be scarce more than one that night he told me his story the story that i give you here as nearly in his own words as i can recall them i toward the eternal fires i was born in connecticut about thirty years ago my name is david innes my father was a wealthy mine owner when i was nineteen he died all his property was to be mine when i had attained my majority provided that i had devoted the two years intervening in close application to the great business i was to inherit i did my best to fulfil the last wishes of my parent not because of the inheritance but because i loved and honored my father for six months i toiled in the mines and in the for i wished to know every minute detail of the business then perry interested me in his invention he was an old fellow who had devoted the better part of a long life to the perfection of a mechanical subterranean prospector as relaxation he studied paleontology i looked over his plans listened to his arguments inspected his working model and then convinced i advanced the funds necessary to construct a practical prospector i shall not go into the details of its construction it lies out there in the desert now about two miles from here tomorrow you may care to ride out and see it roughly it is a steel cylinder a hundred feet long and jointed so that it may turn and twist through solid rock if need be at one end is a mighty revolving drill operated by an engine which perry said generated more power to the cubic inch than any other engine did to the cubic foot i remember that he used to claim that that invention alone would make us fabulously wealthy we were going to make the whole thing public after the successful issue of our first secret trial but perry never returned from that trial trip and i only after ten years hilarius spoke gently it is indeed a grievous sin against god and his church to live together out of holy wedlock and perchance tis true that for this very thing thou hast been afflicted even as david the great king but since thou didst sin ignorantly the lord in his mercy sent me to serve thee in thy sore need ay and in very truth our lady herself showed me where the coney lay snared let us pray god by his dear mother to forgive us our sins and to have mercy on these little ones and kneeling there in the firelight he besought the great father for his family five days passed and despite extreme care victuals were short hilarius dug up roots from the hedgerows and went hungry but at last the pinch came the woman was too weak and ill to walk the babe scarce in life there could be no thought of flight and the little maid grew white and wan and silent then it came to hilarius that he would once again beg food in the village where he had sought help before he went slowly for he had eaten little that his maid might be the better fed and he was very sad when he reached the village he found his errand like to be vain news of the plague was coming from many parts and each man feared for his own skin at every house they questioned him art thou from a hamlet where the plague hath been and when he answered yea the door was shut very soon men angry and afraid came to drive him from the place he gained the village cross and prayed them for love of the saviour and his holy rood to give him bread for his little maid and her mother let them set it in the street he would take it and cross no threshold surely they could not for shame let a little child die of want nay tis better they die so are we safe cried a voice then they fell upon him and beat him and drove him from the village with blows and curses bruised and panting he ran from them and at last the chase ceased breathless and exhausted he flung himself under a hedge a hawk swooped struck near him and rose again with its prey hilarius shuddered but perhaps the hawk had nestlings waiting for food his little maid his eyes filled with tears as he thought of those who awaited him he picked up a stone and watched if perchance a coney might show itself he had never killed but were not his nestlings agape nothing stirred but along the road came a waggon of strange shape and gaily painted he rose to his feet praying the great mother to send him help in his awful need the waggon drew near the driver sat asleep upon the shaft the horse took his own pace it passed him before he could pluck up heart to ask an alms and from the back dangled a small sack and a hen if he begged and was refused his little maid must die a minute later the sack and the hen had changed owners but not unobserved a clear voice called a halt the waggon stood fast two figures sprang out a girl and a boy and hilarius stood before them on the white highway a thief seize the knave cried the girl sharply hilarius stared at her and she at him it was his dancer and she knew him ay despite the change of dress and scene she knew him what the worthy novice turned worldling and thief nay tis a rare jest what of thy fine sermons now good preacher but hilarius answered never a word overcome by shame grief and hunger sudden darkness fell upon him when he came to himself he was sitting propped against the hedge the waggon was drawn up by the roadside and the dancer and her brother stood watching him fetch bread and wine said the girl and to hilarius who tried to speak peace til thou hast eaten hilarius ate eagerly and when he had made an end the dancer said now tell thy tale prithee since when didst thou leave thy saints and thy nursery for such an ill trade as this hilarius told her all and when he had finished he wept because of his little maid and his were not the only tears the dancer went to the waggon and came back with much food taken from her store to which she added the hen the sack held but fodder but gia grumbled her brother there will be naught for us thou canst eat bread or else go hungry she retorted and filled a small sack with the victuals hilarius watched her hardly daring to hope she held it out to him now up and off to thy little maid hilarius took the sack but only to lay it down again kneeling he took both her little brown hands and his tears fell fast as he kissed them maid maid canst forgive my theft ay and my hard words in the forest god help me for a poor blind fool the hungry man was fed young van bibber broke one of his rules of life one day and came this unusual journey into the marts of trade and finance was in response to a call from his lawyer who wanted his signature to some papers it was five years since van bibber had been south of the north side of washington square except as a transient traveller to the ferries on the elevated road and as he walked through the city hall square he looked about him at the new buildings in the air and the bustle and confusion of the streets with as much interest as a lately arrived immigrant he rather enjoyed the novelty of the situation and after he had completed his business at the lawyer's office he tried to stroll along lower broadway as he did on the avenue but people bumped against him and carts and drays tried to run him down when he crossed the side streets and those young men whom he knew seemed to be in a great hurry and expressed such amused surprise at seeing him that he felt very much out of place indeed and so he decided to get back to his club window and its quiet as soon as possible hello van bibber said one of the young men who were speeding by what brings you here have you lost your way i think i have said van bibber if you'll kindly tell me how i can get back to civilization again be obliged to you take the elevated from park place said his friend from over his shoulder as he nodded and dived into the crowd the visitor from had not a very distinct idea as to where park place was but he struck off broadway and followed the line of the elevated road along church street it was at the corner of vesey street that a dirty and object stood still in his tracks and begged van bibber for a few cents to buy food i've come all the way from chicago said the object and i haven't tasted food for hours van bibber drew away as though the object had a contagious disease in his rags and handed him a quarter without waiting to receive the man's blessing poor devil said van bibber fancy going without dinner all day he could not fancy this though he tried and the impossibility of it impressed him so much that he amiably determined to go back and hunt up the object and give him more money van bibber's ideas of a dinner were rather exalted he did not know of places where a quarter was good for a square meal including one roast three vegetables and pie he hardly considered a quarter a sufficiently large tip for the waiter who served the dinner and decidedly not enough for the dinner itself he did not see his man at first and when he did the man did not see him van bibber watched him stop three gentlemen two of whom gave him some money and then the object approached van bibber and repeated his sad tale in a monotone he evidently did not recognize van bibber and the clubman gave him a and walked away feeling that the man must surely have enough by this time with which to get something to eat if only a luncheon this retracing of his footsteps had confused van bibber and he made a complete circuit of the block before he discovered that he had lost his bearings he was standing just where he had started and gazing along the line of the elevated road looking for a station when the familiar accents of the object again saluted him when van bibber faced him the beggar looked uneasy he was not sure whether or not he had approached this particular gentleman before but van bibber conceived an idea of much subtlety and deceived the object by again putting his hand in his pocket nothing to eat for hours dear me drawled the clubman sympathetically haven't you any money either not a cent groaned the object an i'm just faint for food sir s help me i hate to beg sir it isn't the money i want it's jest food i'm starvin sir well said van bibber suddenly if it is just something to eat you want come in here with me and i'll give you your breakfast but the man held back and began to whine and complain that they wouldn't let the likes of him in such a fine place oh yes they will said van bibber glancing at the bill of fare in front of the place it seems to be extremely cheap beefsteak fifteen cents for instance go in he added and there was something in his tone which made the object move ungraciously into the it was a very queer place van bibber thought and the people stared very hard at him and his gloves and the gardenia in his coat and at the tramp accompanying him you ain't going to eat two breakfasts are yer asked one of the very waiters of the object the object looked uneasy and van bibber who stood beside his chair smiled in triumph the contents of the petition were to this purpose o our lord and sovereign prince emmanuel the potent the prince grace is poured into thy lips and to thee belong mercy and forgiveness though we have rebelled against thee we who are no more worthy to be called thy mansoul nor yet fit to partake of common benefits do beseech thee and thy father by thee to do away our transgressions we confess that thou mightest cast us away for them but do it not for thy sake let the lord rather take an opportunity at our miserable condition to let out his bowels and compassions to us we are compassed on every side lord our own backslidings reprove us our diabolonians within our town fright us and the army of the angel of the bottomless pit distresses us thy grace can be our salvation and whither to go but to thee we know not furthermore o gracious prince we have weakened our captains and they are discouraged sick and of late some of them grievously worsted and beaten out of the field by the power and force of the tyrant yea even those of our captains in whose valour we did formerly use to put most of our confidence they are as wounded men besides lord our enemies are lively and they are strong they vaunt and boast themselves and do threaten to part us among themselves for a booty they are fallen also upon us lord with many thousand doubters such as with whom we cannot tell what to do they are all and unmerciful ones and they bid defiance to us and thee our wisdom is gone our power is gone because thou art departed from us nor have we what we may call ours but sin shame and confusion of face for sin take pity upon us o lord take pity upon us thy miserable town of mansoul and save us out of the hands of our enemies amen this petition as was touched afore was handed by the lord secretary and carried to the court by the brave and most stout captain credence now he carried it out at for that as i said was the of the town and he went and came to emmanuel with it now how it came out i do not know but for certain it did and that so far as to reach the ears of diabolus thus i conclude because that the tyrant had it presently by the end and charged the town of mansoul with it saying thou rebellious and mansoul i will make thee to leave off petitioning art thou yet for petitioning i will make thee to leave yea he also knew who the messenger was that carried the petition to the prince and it made him both to fear and rage wherefore he commanded that his drum should be beat again a thing that mansoul could not abide to hear but when diabolus will have his drum beat mansoul must abide the noise well the drum was beat and the diabolonians were gathered together then said diabolus o ye stout diabolonians be it known unto you that there is treachery hatched against us in the rebellious town of mansoul for albeit the town is in our possession as you see yet these miserable mansoulians have attempted to dare and have been so hardy as yet to send to the court to emmanuel for help this i give you to understand that ye may yet know how to carry it to the wretched town of mansoul wherefore o my trusty diabolonians i command that yet more and more ye distress this town of mansoul and vex it with your wiles ravish their women deflower their virgins slay their children brain their ancients fire their town and what other mischief you can and let this be the reward of the mansoulians from me for their desperate rebellions against me this you see was the charge but something stepped in betwixt that and execution for as yet there was but little more done than to rage moreover when diabolus had done thus he went the next way up to the castle gates and demanded that upon pain of death the gates should be opened to him and that entrance should be given him and his men that followed after to whom mr replied for he it was that had the charge of that gate that the gate should not be opened unto him nor to the men that followed after him he said moreover that mansoul when she had suffered awhile should be made perfect strengthened settled then said diabolus deliver me then the men that have petitioned against me especially captain credence that carried it to your prince deliver that varlet into my hands and i will depart from the town then up starts a diabolonian whose name was mr fooling and said my lord offereth you fair it is better for you that one man perish than that your whole mansoul should be undone but mr made him this replication how long will mansoul be kept out of the dungeon when she hath given up her faith to diabolus as good lose the town as lose captain credence for if one be gone the other must follow but to that mr fooling said nothing the house of mapuhi despite the heavy clumsiness of her lines the aorai handled easily in the light breeze and her captain ran her well in before he hove to just outside the suck of the surf the atoll of hikueru lay low on the water a circle of pounded coral sand a hundred yards wide twenty miles in circumference and from three to five feet above mark on the bottom of the huge and glassy lagoon was much pearl shell and from the deck of the schooner across the slender ring of the atoll the divers could be seen at work but the lagoon had no entrance for even a trading schooner with a favoring breeze cutters could win in through the tortuous and shallow channel but the schooners lay off and on outside and sent in their small boats the aorai swung out a boat smartly into which sprang half a dozen sailors clad only in scarlet loincloths they took the oars while in the stern sheets at the steering sweep stood a young man garbed in the tropic white that marks the european the golden strain of polynesia betrayed itself in the of his fair skin and cast up golden sheens and lights through the glimmering blue of his eyes raoul he was alexandre raoul youngest son of marie raoul the wealthy who owned and managed half a dozen trading schooners similar to the aorai across an eddy just outside the entrance and in and through and over a boiling the boat fought its way to the mirrored calm of the lagoon young raoul leaped out upon the white sand and shook hands with a tall native the man's chest and shoulders were magnificent but the stump of a right arm beyond the flesh of which the bone projected several inches attested the encounter with a shark that had put an end to his diving days and made him a fawner and an intriguer for small favors have you heard alec were his first words mapuhi has found a pearl such a pearl never was there one like it ever fished up in hikueru nor in all the paumotus nor in all the world buy it from him he has it now and remember that i told you first he is a fool and you can get it cheap have you any tobacco straight up the beach to a shack under a pandanus tree raoul headed he was his mother's supercargo and his business was to comb all the paumotus for the wealth of copra shell and pearls that they yielded up he was a young supercargo it was his second voyage in such capacity and he suffered much secret worry from his lack of experience in pricing pearls but when mapuhi exposed the pearl to his sight he managed to suppress the startle it gave him and to maintain a careless commercial expression on his face for the pearl had struck him a blow it was large as a pigeon egg a perfect sphere of a whiteness that reflected opalescent lights from all colors about it it was alive never had he seen anything like it when mapuhi dropped it into his hand he was surprised by the weight of it that showed that it was a good pearl he examined it closely through a pocket magnifying glass it was without flaw or blemish the purity of it seemed almost to melt into the atmosphere out of his hand in the shade it was softly luminous gleaming like a tender moon so translucently white was it that when he dropped it into a glass of water he had difficulty in finding it so straight and swiftly had it sunk to the bottom that he knew its weight was excellent well what do you want for it he asked with a fine assumption of nonchalance i want mapuhi began and behind him framing his own dark face the dark faces of two women and a girl nodded concurrence in what he wanted their heads were bent forward they were animated by a suppressed eagerness their eyes flashed avariciously i want a house mapuhi went on it must have a roof of galvanized iron and an it must be six fathoms long with a porch all around a big room must be in the centre with a round table in the middle of it and the on the wall there must be four bedrooms two on each side of the big room and in each bedroom must be an iron bed two chairs and a washstand and back of the house must be a kitchen a good kitchen with pots and pans and a stove and you must build the house on my island which is fakarava is that all raoul asked incredulously there must be a sewing machine spoke up tefara mapuhi's wife not forgetting the added nauri mapuhi's mother yes that is all said mapuhi young raoul laughed he laughed long and heartily but while he laughed he secretly performed problems in mental arithmetic he had never built a house in his life and his notions concerning house building were hazy while he laughed he calculated the cost of the voyage to tahiti for materials of the materials themselves of the voyage back again to fakarava and the cost of landing the materials and of building the house it would come to four thousand french dollars allowing a margin for safety four thousand french dollars were equivalent to twenty thousand francs it was impossible how was he to know the value of such a pearl twenty thousand francs was a lot of money and of his mother's money at that olalla now said the doctor my part is done and i may say with some vanity well done it remains only to get you out of this cold and poisonous city and to give you two months of a pure air and an easy conscience the last is your affair to the first i think i can help you it fells indeed rather oddly it was but the other day the padre came in from the country and as he and i are old friends although of contrary professions he applied to me in a matter of distress among some of his parishioners this was a family but you are ignorant of spain and even the names of our grandees are hardly known to you suffice it then that they were once great people and are now fallen to the brink of destitution nothing now belongs to them but the residencia and certain leagues of desert mountain in the greater part of which not even a goat could support life but the house is a fine old place and stands at a great height among the hills and most salubriously and i had no sooner heard my friend's tale than i remembered you i told him i had a wounded officer wounded in the good cause who was now able to make a change and i proposed that his friends should take you for a lodger instantly the padre's face grew dark as i had maliciously foreseen it would it was out of the question he said then let them starve said i for i have no sympathy with tatterdemalion pride we separated not very content with one another but yesterday to my wonder the padre returned and made a submission the difficulty he said he had found upon enquiry to be less than he had feared or in other words these proud people had put their pride in their pocket i closed with the offer and subject to your approval i have taken rooms for you in the residencia the air of these mountains will renew your blood and the quiet in which you will there live is worth all the medicines in the world doctor said i you have been throughout my good angel and your advice is a command but tell me if you please something of the family with which i am to reside i am coming to that replied my friend and indeed there is a difficulty in the way these beggars are as i have said of very high descent and swollen with the most baseless vanity they have lived for some generations in a growing isolation drawing away on either hand from the rich who had now become too high for them and from the poor whom they still regarded as too low and even when poverty forces them to unfasten their door to a guest they cannot do so without a most ungracious stipulation you are to remain they say a stranger they will give you attendance but they refuse from the first the idea of the smallest intimacy i will not deny that i was piqued and perhaps the feeling strengthened my desire to go for i was confident that i could break down that barrier if i desired there is nothing offensive in such a stipulation said i and i even sympathise with the feeling that inspired it it is true they have never seen you returned the doctor politely and if they knew you were the handsomest and the most pleasant man that ever came from england where i am told that handsome men are common but pleasant ones not so much so they would doubtless make you welcome with a better grace but since you take the thing so well it matters not to me indeed it seems discourteous but you will find yourself the gainer the family will not much tempt you a mother a son and a daughter an old woman said to be halfwitted a country lout and a country girl who stands very high with her confessor and is therefore chuckled the physician most likely plain there is not much in that to attract the fancy of a dashing officer and yet you say they are i objected well as to that i should distinguish returned the doctor the mother is not so the children the mother was the last representative of a princely stock degenerate both in parts and fortune her father was not only poor he was mad and the girl ran wild about the residencia till his death then much of the fortune having died with him and the family being quite extinct the girl ran wilder than ever until at last she married heaven knows whom a muleteer some say others a smuggler while there are some who uphold there was no marriage at all and that felipe and olalla are bastards the union such as it was was tragically dissolved some years ago but they live in such seclusion and the country at that time was in so much disorder that the precise manner of the man's end is known only to the priest if even to him i begin to think i shall have strange experiences said i chapter sixteen the two girls let themselves into the house noiselessly and turning out the left for them by their mother crept upstairs on tiptoe and went through the upper hall directly to laura's room cora's being nearer the at their age it is proper that a gayety be used three times in anticipation and actually and in the last was of course now in order they went to laura's room to talk it over there was no in this small chamber but they found laura's burning brightly upon her how queer said laura with some surprise as she closed the door mother never leaves the lamp lit for me she's always so afraid of lamps exploding perhaps miss peirce came in here to read and forgot to turn it out suggested cora seating herself on the edge of the bed and letting her silk wrap fall from her shoulders oh laura wasn't he gorgeous she referred to the gallant defender of our seas it appeared and while laura undressed and got into a wrapper cora recounted in detail the history of the impetuous sailor's enthrallment a resume predicted three hours earlier by a gleeful whisper hissed across the maritime shoulder as the sisters swung near each other during a waltz proposed i've always heard they're horribly inconstant she said regretfully but oh laura wasn't he beautiful to look at do you think he's more beautiful than val no don't tell me if you do i don't want to hear it val was so provoking he didn't seem to mind it at all he's nothing but a big brute sometimes he wouldn't even admit that he minded when i asked him i was idiot enough to ask i couldn't help it he was so tantalizing and exasperating laughing at me i never knew anybody like him he's so sure of himself and he can be so cold sometimes i wonder if he really cares about anything deep down in his heart anything except himself he seems so selfish there are times when he almost makes me hate him but just when i get to thinking i do i find i don't he's so deliciously strong and there's such a big luxury in being understood i always feel he knows me clear to the bone somehow but oh she sighed regretfully doesn't a uniform become a man they ought to all wear em it would look silly on such a little goat as that wade trumble though nothing could make him look like a whole man did you see him glaring at me beast i was going to be so nice and kittenish and do all my prettiest tricks for him to help val with his oil company val thinks wade would come in yet if i'd only get him in the mood to have another talk with val about it but the spiteful little rat wouldn't come near me i believe that was one of the reasons val laughed at me and pretended not to mind my getting proposed to he must have minded he couldn't have helped minding it really that's his way he's so mean he won't show things he knows me i can't keep anything from him he reads me like a signboard and then about himself he keeps me guessing and i can't tell when i've guessed right ray vilas behaved disgustingly of course he was horrid and awful i might have expected it i suppose richard was wailing his tiresome sorrows on your poor shoulder no said laura he was very cheerful he seemed glad you were having a good time he didn't look particularly cheerful at me i never saw so slow a man i wonder when he's going to find out about that pendant val would have seen it the instant i put it on and oh laura isn't george wattling funny he's just soft he's though she continued pensively adding i promised to motor out to the country club with him for tea oh cora protested laura no please don't i've promised so i'll have to now cora laughed it'll do mary kane good oh i'm not going to bother much with him he makes me tired i never saw anything so complacent as that girl when she came in as if her little georgie was the greatest capture the world had ever seen she chattered on laura passive listened with a thoughtful expression somewhat preoccupied the talker yawned at last it must be after three she said listlessly having gone over her evening so often that the colours were beginning to fade she yawned again laura she remarked absently i don't see how you can sleep in this bed it sags so i've never noticed it said her sister it's a very comfortable old bed cora went to her to be unfastened reverting to the lieutenant during the operation and kissing the warmly at its conclusion you're always so sweet to me laura she said affectionately i don't know how you manage it you're so good she laughed sometimes i wonder how you stand me if i were you i'm positive i couldn't stand me at all another kiss and a hearty embrace and she picked up her wrap and skurried silently through the hall to her own room psams travel car she would have put travelling carriage but she made the letters too big so there was no room the bag was made into a bag with old sewing machine and the strings of it were and best red hair ribbons at when the boys had come home with a most unfavourable report of the st park ducks anthea ventured to awaken the psammead and to show it its new travelling bag humph it said sniffing a little contemptuously yet at the same time affectionately not so dusty the psammead seemed to pick up very easily the kind of things that people said nowadays for a creature that had in its time associated with megatheriums and pterodactyls its quickness was really wonderful more worthy of me it said than the kind of bag given away with a pound of plaice when do you propose to take me out in it i should like a rest from taking you or us anywhere said cyril but jane said i want to go to egypt i did like that egyptian princess that came to marry the king in babylon she told me about the larks they have in egypt and the cats do go there and i told her what the bird things on the amulet were like and she said it was egyptian writing the others exchanged looks of silent rejoicing at the thought of their cleverness in having concealed from jane the terrors they had suffered in the dungeon below the euphrates so nice too jane went on because of doctor scripture history i would like to go there when joseph was dreaming those curious dreams or when moses was doing wonderful things with snakes and sticks i care about snakes said anthea shuddering well we be in at that part but babylon was lovely we had cream and sweet sticky stuff and i expect the same there was a good deal of discussion but it all ended in agreeing to idea and next morning directly after breakfast which was kippers and very nice the psammead was invited to get into his travelling carriage the moment after it had done so with stiff furry reluctance like that of a cat when you want to nurse it and its ideas are not the same as yours old nurse came in well chickies she said are you feeling very dull oh no nurse dear said anthea having a lovely time just going off to see some old ancient relics ah said old nurse the royal academy i suppose go wasting your money too reckless all she cleared away the kipper bones and the and when she had swept up the crumbs and removed the cloth the amulet was held up and the order given just as duchesses and other people give it to their coachmen to egypt please said anthea when cyril had uttered the wonderful name of power when moses was there added jane and there in the dingy fitzroy street the amulet grew big and it was an arch and through it they saw a blue blue sky and a running river no stop said cyril and pulled down hand with the amulet in it what silly cuckoos we all are he said of course we go we leave home for a single minute now for fear that minute should be the minute what minute be what minute asked jane impatiently trying to get her hand away from cyril the minute when the queen of babylon comes said cyril and then everyone saw it for some days life flowed in a very slow dusty uneventful stream the children could never go out all at once because they never knew when the king of babylon would go out lion hunting and leave his queen free to pay them that surprise visit to which she was without doubt eagerly looking forward so they took it in turns two and two to go out and to stay in the would have been much duller than they were but for the new interest taken in them by the learned gentleman he called anthea in one day to show her a beautiful necklace of purple and gold beads i saw one like that she said in in the british museum perhaps i like to call the place where i saw it babylon said anthea cautiously a pretty fancy said the learned gentleman and quite correct too because as a matter of fact these beads did come from babylon the other three were all out that day the boys had been going to the zoo and jane had said so plaintively sure i am fonder of rhinoceroses than either of you are that anthea had told her to run along then and she had run catching the boys before that part of the road where fitzroy street suddenly becomes fitzroy square i think babylon is most frightfully interesting said anthea i do have such interesting dreams about it at least not dreams exactly but quite as wonderful do sit down and tell me said he so she sat down and told and he asked her a lot of questions and she answered them as well as she could explanatory in this book a number of dialects are used to wit the missouri negro dialect the extremest form of the backwoods southwestern dialect the ordinary pike county dialect and four modified varieties of this last the shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion or by guesswork but painstakingly and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech i make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding the author huckleberry finn scene the mississippi valley time forty to fifty years ago chapter i you don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of the adventures of tom sawyer but that ain't no matter that book was made by mr mark twain and he told the truth mainly there was things which he stretched but mainly he told the truth that is nothing i never seen anybody but lied one time or another without it was aunt polly or the widow or maybe mary aunt polly tom's aunt polly she is and mary and the widow douglas is all told about in that book which is mostly a true book with some stretchers as i said before now the way that the book winds up is this tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave and it made us rich we got six thousand dollars apiece all gold it was an awful sight of money when it was piled up well judge thatcher he took it and put it out at interest and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round more than a body could tell what to do with the widow douglas she took me for her son and allowed she would sivilize me but it was rough living in the house all the time considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways and so when i couldn't stand it no longer i lit out i got into my old rags and my again and was free and satisfied but tom sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers and i might join if i would go back to the widow and be respectable so i went back the widow she cried over me and called me a poor lost lamb and she called me a lot of other names too but she never meant no harm by it she put me in them new clothes again and i couldn't do nothing but sweat and sweat and feel all cramped up well then the old thing commenced again the widow rung a bell for supper and you had to come to time when you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals though there warn't really anything the matter with them that is nothing only everything was cooked by itself in a barrel of odds and ends it is different things get mixed up and the juice kind of swaps around and the things go better after supper she got out her book and learned me about moses and the bulrushers and i was in a sweat to find out all about him but by and by she let it out that moses had been dead a considerable long time so then i didn't care no more about him because i don't take no stock in dead people pretty soon i wanted to smoke and asked the widow to let me but she wouldn't she said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean and i must try to not do it any more that is just the way with some people they get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it here she was about moses which was no kin to her and no use to anybody being gone you see yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it and she took snuff too of course that was all right because she done it herself her sister miss watson a tolerable slim old maid with goggles on had just come to live with her and took a set at me now with a she worked me middling hard for about an hour and then the widow made her ease up i couldn't stood it much longer then for an hour it was deadly dull and i was fidgety miss watson would say don't put your feet up there huckleberry and don't scrunch up like that huckleberry set up straight and pretty soon she would say don't gap and stretch like that huckleberry why don't you try to behave then she told me all about the bad place and i said i wished i was there she got mad then but i didn't mean no harm all i wanted was to go somewheres all i wanted was a change i warn't particular she said it was wicked to say what i said said she wouldn't say it for the whole world she was going to live so as to go to the good place well i couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going so i made up my mind i wouldn't try for it but i never said so because it would only make trouble and wouldn't do no good the hussy there are some stories that have to be true the sort that cannot be fabricated by a ready and by the same token there are some men with stories to tell who cannot be doubted such a man was julian jones although i doubt if the average reader of this will believe the story julian jones told me nevertheless i believe it so thoroughly am i convinced of its verity that i am willing nay eager to invest capital in the enterprise and embark personally on the adventure to a far land it was in the australian building at the panama pacific exposition that i met him i was standing before an exhibit of facsimiles of the record nuggets which had been discovered in the goldfields of the antipodes knobbed misshapen and massive it was as difficult to believe that they were not real gold as it was to believe the accompanying statistics of their weights and values what those call a nugget boomed over my shoulder directly at the largest of the specimens i turned and looked up into the dim blue eyes of julian jones i looked up for he stood something like six feet four inches in height his hair a wispy sandy yellow seemed as dimmed and faded as his eyes it may have been the sun which had washed out his colouring at least his face bore the evidence of a prodigious and ardent which had long since faded to yellow as his eyes turned from the exhibit and focussed on mine i noted a queer look in them as of one who vainly tries to recall some fact of supreme importance the matter with it as a nugget i demanded the remote indwelling expression went out of his eyes as he boomed why its size it does seem large i admitted but no doubt authentic the australian government would scarcely dare large he interrupted with a sniff and a sneer largest ever discovered i started on ever discovered his dim eyes smouldered hotly as he proceeded do you think that every lump of gold ever discovered has got into the newspapers and encyclopedias well i replied judicially if one that i see how to know about it if a really big nugget or elects to blush unseen but it he broke in quickly i saw it with my own eyes and besides too tanned to blush anyway a railroad man and been in the tropics a lot why i used to be the colour of mahogany real old mahogany and have been taken for a spaniard more than once it was my turn to interrupt and i did was that nugget bigger than those in there mr er jones julian jones is my name he dug into an inner pocket and produced an envelope addressed to such a person care of general delivery san francisco and i in turn presented him with my card pleased to know you sir he said extending his hand his voice booming as if accustomed to loud noises or wide spaces of course heard of you seen your picture in the papers and all that and though i say it that i want to say that i care a rap about those articles you wrote on mexico wrong all wrong you make the mistake of all gringos in thinking a mexican is a white man he none of them greasers spiggoties and all the rest of the cattle why sir they think like we think or reason or act even their multiplication table is different you think seven times seven is but not them they work it out different and white white to them either let me give you an example buying coffee retail for in or lots how big was that nugget you referred to i queried firmly as big as the biggest of those bigger he said quietly bigger than the whole blamed exhibit of them put together and then some he paused and regarded me with a steadfast gaze i see no reason why i go into the matter with you got a reputation a man ought to be able to trust and read done some tall skylarking yourself in places been browsing around with an eye open for some one to go in with me on the proposition you can trust me i said and here i am blazing out into print with the whole story just as he told it to me as we sat on a bench by the lagoon before the palace of fine arts with the cries of the sea gulls in our ears well he should have kept his appointment with me but i anticipate as we started to leave the building and hunt for a seat a small woman possibly thirty years of age with a complexion of the wife sort darted up to him in a way for all the world like the darting veering gulls over our heads and fastened herself to his arm with the accuracy and dispatch and inevitableness of a piece of machinery chapter they fought like brave men long and well they piled that ground

close calmly as to a night's repose like flowers at set of sun halleck the sun found the lenape on the succeeding day a nation of mourners the sounds of the battle were over and they had fed fat their ancient grudge and had avenged their recent quarrel with the mengwe by the destruction of a whole community the black and murky atmosphere that floated around the spot where the hurons had encamped sufficiently announced of itself the fate of that wandering tribe while hundreds of ravens that struggled above the summits of the mountains or swept in noisy flocks across the wide ranges of the woods furnished a frightful direction to the scene of the combat in short any eye at all practised in the signs of a frontier warfare might easily have traced all those unerring evidences of the ruthless results which attend an indian vengeance still the sun rose on the lenape a nation of mourners no shouts of success no songs of triumph were heard in rejoicings for their victory the latest straggler had returned from his fell employment only to strip himself of the terrific emblems of his bloody calling and to join in the lamentations of his countrymen as a stricken people pride and exultation were supplanted by humility and the fiercest of human passions was already succeeded by the most profound and unequivocal demonstrations of grief the lodges were deserted but a broad belt of earnest faces encircled a spot in their vicinity whither everything possessing life had repaired and where all were now collected in deep and awful silence though beings of every rank and age of both sexes and of all pursuits had united to form this breathing wall of bodies they were influenced by a single emotion each eye was riveted on the center of that ring which contained the objects of so much and of so common an interest six delaware girls with their long dark flowing tresses falling loosely across their bosoms stood apart and only gave proof of their existence as they occasionally strewed herbs and forest flowers on a litter of fragrant plants that under a pall of indian robes supported all that now remained of the ardent and generous cora her form was concealed in many wrappers of the same simple manufacture and her face was shut forever from the gaze of men at her feet was seated the desolate munro his aged head was bowed nearly to the earth in compelled submission to the stroke of providence but a hidden anguish struggled about his furrowed brow that was only partially concealed by the careless locks of gray that had fallen neglected on his temples gamut stood at his side his meek head bared to the rays of the sun while his eyes wandering and concerned seemed to be equally divided between that little volume which contained so many quaint but holy maxims and the being in whose behalf his soul yearned to administer consolation heyward was also nigh supporting himself against a tree and endeavoring to keep down those sudden risings of sorrow that it required his utmost manhood to subdue but sad and melancholy as this group may easily be imagined it was far less touching than another that occupied the opposite space of the same area seated as in

the corpse chingachgook was placed without arms paint or adornment of any sort except the bright blue blazonry of his race that was indelibly impressed on his naked bosom during the long period that the tribe had thus been collected the mohican warrior had kept a steady anxious look on the cold and senseless countenance of his son so riveted and intense had been that gaze and so changeless his attitude that a stranger might not have told the living from the dead but for the occasional gleamings of a troubled spirit that shot athwart the dark visage of one and the deathlike calm that had forever settled on the lineaments of the other the scout was hard by leaning in a pensive posture on his own fatal and avenging weapon while tamenund supported by the elders of his nation occupied a high place at hand whence he might look down on the mute and sorrowful assemblage of his people just within the inner edge of the circle stood a soldier in the military attire of a strange nation and without it was his warhorse in the center of a collection of mounted domestics seemingly in readiness to undertake some distant journey the vestments of the stranger announced him to be one who held a responsible situation near the person of the captain of the canadas and who as it would now seem finding his errand of peace frustrated by the fierce impetuosity of his allies was content to become a silent and sad spectator of the fruits of a contest that he had arrived too late to anticipate chapter when stacy had been excused the chair was ready to adjourn on the advice of her attorney diana requested that it be on the record that anuse one of the panel members had acted throughout the hearing in a manner prejudicial and threatening to diana and to her witnesses henry was livid with anger you are out of order you are making statements about people on the committee that has nothing to do with this your comment will not be entered and the committee will disregard it how typical of that woman to state the obvious he fumed inwardly always before while ruling he had kept his cool and at least glanced at the panel members for assent or dissent this time he ably demonstrated that the show of democratic procedure was only that a show damn her she had unglued him that time in any event diana was refused permission to enter the evidence she had that would have shown that anuse was biased next diana reviewed the poor performance given by the document examiner he testified that he could not make a decision on the first set of exemplars sent him then when he was sent twenty years worth of documents containing the handwriting of multiple individuals he claimed that he disregarded most of it she went over all of the individual letters in the suspect evaluations that avery had not been able to match with anything in the writing he used as standards this shows that there were as many as matches in his presentation the panel listened passively then henry asked if that was her final statement no she answered i shall read that now she picked up the paper which had been written mostly by her attorney and edited by her it was designed to get the legal points on the record so that they could be presented later in a court of law we are at the end of another hearing and it is a grim page in the rights of faculty members of this university i have been tried by a committee which is chaired by the prosecuting official he has reopened proceedings engaged in ex parte communications received legal advice from the prosecution's lawyer and denied me the opportunity to even examine the evidence against me a faculty member at any state college and indeed a mail room employee in the state motor vehicle department would have more rights than you have given me henry tuned her out all this legal stuff he thought is just to give her attorney crap to fill a brief murrain had told him this would probably happen now what's this alertly henry listened there are strong reasons to believe this panel has operated in violation of my state and federal rights if this committee does not end this unfortunate proceeding the district court will finally have to determine these issues this committee at the last hearing made several promises to me and i was fool enough to believe them it said that it would issue a decision within a few weeks instead it launched a new investigation of its own without my knowledge or participation which consumed over half a year second this committee assured me that i would not be affected by these charges as i continued my teaching assignments in the department go back to work you all assured me at the last hearing everything is taken care of i went back and was ordered to move out of my office into a corner of the nutrition teaching lab i was denied a telephone and given no help in moving my things my name has been removed from the department mail boxes and department meetings are held when i am teaching classes for these many months while you reopened the investigation behind my back i have been a in my department jane shifted in her chair uneasily she recalled how all of these promises had been made when the panel had ended the first hearing in fact she had made some of them herself it had seemed then she reflected that the evidence against diana was inconclusive and that the majority of the panel felt this was so she had expected that just a simple vote of the panel would send diana back to her classroom where she belonged i have served this university for nearly a students have consistently reviewed my efforts favorably and that is a source of much consternation in my department the entire central administration is prosecuting me angered because i insisted on minimal rights for example i refused to have my job eliminated or my copyrighted manual used without my consent they are determined to terminate me and have spared no resources in support of that goal it would appear that some of these efforts violate my rights under state law federal law and the constitution that's really what it's all about decided annette as she kept her head lowered and her eyes fastened on the unseen files before her violation of her rights violation of my rights to freely consider the evidence both for and against her and render an impartial judgment i believe this case represents what is in store for a person who does not remain in the favor of those who determine policy for this university chapter ix o lady we receive but what we give and in our life alone does nature live ours is her

voice of its own birth of all sweet sounds the life and element coleridge from this time until i arrived at the palace of fairy land i can attempt no consecutive account of my wanderings and adventures everything henceforward existed for me in its relation to my attendant what influence he exercised upon everything into contact with which i was brought may be understood from a few detached instances to begin with this very day on which he first joined me after i had walked heartlessly along for two or three hours i was very weary and lay down to rest in a most delightful part of the forest carpeted with wild flowers i lay for half an hour in a dull repose and then got up to pursue my way the flowers on the spot where i had lain were crushed to the earth but i saw that they would soon lift their heads and rejoice again in the sun and air not so those on which my shadow had lain the very outline of it could be traced in the withered lifeless grass and the scorched and shrivelled flowers which stood there dead and hopeless of any resurrection i shuddered and hastened away with sad forebodings in a few days i had reason to dread an extension of its baleful influences from the fact that it was no longer confined to one position in regard to myself hitherto when seized with an irresistible desire to look on my evil demon which longing would unaccountably seize me at any moment returning at longer or shorter intervals sometimes every minute i had to turn my head backwards and look over my shoulder in which position as long as i could retain it i was fascinated but one day having come out on a clear grassy hill which commanded a glorious prospect though of what i cannot now tell my shadow moved round and came in front of me and presently a new manifestation increased my distress for it began to coruscate and shoot out on all sides a radiation of dim shadow these rays of gloom issued from the central shadow as from a black sun lengthening and shortening with continual change but wherever a ray struck that part of earth or sea or sky became void and desert and sad to my heart on this the first development of its new power one ray shot out beyond the rest seeming to lengthen infinitely until it smote the great sun on the face which withered and darkened beneath the blow i turned away and went on the shadow retreated to its former position and when i looked again it had drawn in all its spears of darkness and followed like a dog at my heels once as i passed by a cottage there came out a lovely fairy child with two wondrous toys one in each hand the one was the tube through which the poet looks when he beholds the same thing everywhere the other that through which he looks when he combines into new forms of loveliness those images of beauty which his own choice has gathered from all regions wherein he has travelled round the head was an aureole of emanating rays as i looked at him in wonder and delight round crept from behind me the something dark and the child stood in my shadow straightway he was a commonplace boy with a rough straw hat through which brim the sun shone from behind the toys he carried were a and a kaleidoscope i sighed and departed one evening as a great silent flood of western gold flowed through an avenue in the woods down the stream just as when i saw him first came the sad knight riding on his chestnut steed but his armour did not shine half so red as when i saw him first many a blow of mighty sword and axe turned aside by the strength of his mail and glancing adown the surface had swept from its path the fretted rust and the glorious steel had answered the kindly blow with the thanks of returning light these streaks and spots made his armour look like the floor of a forest in the sunlight his forehead was higher than before for the contracting wrinkles were nearly gone and the sadness that remained on his face was the sadness of a dewy summer twilight not that of a frosty autumn morn he too had met the as i but he had plunged into the torrent of mighty deeds and the stain was nearly washed away no shadow followed him he had not entered the dark house he had not had time to open the closet door will he ever look in i said to myself must his shadow find him some day but i could not answer my own questions epilogue of the cigar divan on a certain day of lashing rain in the december of last year and between the hours of nine and ten in the morning mr edward challoner pioneered himself under an umbrella to the door of the cigar divan in rupert street it was a place he had visited but once before the memory of what had followed on that visit and the fear of somerset having prevented his return even now he looked in before he entered but the shop was free of customers the young man behind the counter was so intently writing in a penny that he paid no heed to arrival on a second glance it seemed to the latter that he recognised him by jove he thought unquestionably somerset and though this was the very man he had been so sedulously careful to avoid his unexplained position at the receipt of custom changed distaste to curiosity or opulent rotunda strike the sky said the shopman to himself in the tone of one considering a verse i suppose it would be too much to say orotunda and yet how noble it were or opulent orotunda strike the sky but that is the bitterness of arts you see a good effect and some nonsense about sense continually intervenes somerset my dear fellow said challoner is this a masquerade what challoner cried the shopman i am delighted to see you one moment till i finish the octave of my sonnet only the octave and with a friendly waggle of the hand he once more buried himself in the commerce of the muses i say he said presently looking up you seem in wonderful preservation how about the hundred pounds i have made a small inheritance from a great aunt in wales replied challoner modestly ah said somerset i very much doubt the legitimacy of inheritance the state in my view should collar it i am now going through a stage of socialism and poetry he added apologetically as one who spoke of a course of medicinal waters and are you really the person of the establishment inquired challoner deftly evading the word shop a vendor sir a vendor returned the other pocketing his poesy i help old happy and glorious can i offer you a weed well i scarcely like began challoner nonsense my dear fellow cried the shopman we are very proud of the business and the old man let me inform you besides being the most egregious of created beings from the point of view of ethics is literally sprung from the loins of kings de godall je suis le fervent there is only one godall by the way he added as challoner lit his cigar how did you get on with the detective trade i did not try said challoner curtly ah well i did returned somerset and made the most incomparable mess of it lost all my money and fairly covered myself with odium and ridicule there is more in that business challoner than meets the eye there is more in fact in all businesses you must believe in them or get up the belief that you believe hence he added the recognised inferiority of the plumber for no one could believe in plumbing a propos asked challoner do you still paint not now replied paul but i think of taking up the violin eye which had been somewhat restless since the trade of the detective had been named now rested for a moment on the columns of the morning paper where it lay spread upon the counter by jove he cried odd what is odd asked paul oh nothing returned the other only i once met a person called so did i cried somerset is there anything about him challoner read as follows mysterious death in stepney an inquest was held yesterday on the body of patrick described as a carpenter doctor dovering stated that he had for some time treated the deceased as a dispensary patient for sleeplessness loss of appetite and nervous depression there was no cause of death to be found he would say the deceased had sunk deceased was not a temperate man which doubtless accelerated death deceased complained of dumb ague but witness had never been able to detect any positive disease he did not know that he had any family he regarded him as a person of unsound intellect who believed himself a member and the victim of some secret society if he were to hazard an opinion he would say deceased had died of fear and the doctor would be right cried somerset and my dear challoner i am so relieved to hear of his demise that i will well after all he added poor devil he was well served the door at this moment opened and desborough appeared upon the threshold he was wrapped in a long waterproof imperfectly supplied with buttons his boots were full of water his hat greasy with service and yet he wore the air of one exceeding well content with life he was hailed by the two others with exclamations of surprise and welcome and did you try the detective business inquired paul no returned harry oh yes by the way i did though twice and got caught out both times but i thought i should find my my wife here he added with a kind of proud confusion x the lake at

where the sun struck the water its shafts flamed back blindingly at the sky and the least shade was black by contrast the lake was so smooth that the reflection of the trees on its edge seemed enamelled on a solid surface but gradually as the sun declined the water grew transparent and charity leaning over plunged her fascinated gaze into depths so clear that she saw the inverted interwoven

trees sparkled in the sun and all along the horizon the clear hills throbbed with light charity leaned back in the stern and harney unshipped the oars and lay in the bottom of the boat without speaking ever since their meeting at the creston pool he had been subject to these brooding silences which were as different as possible from the pauses when they ceased to speak because words were needless at such times his face wore the expression she had seen on it when she had looked in at him from the darkness and again there came over her a sense of the mysterious distance between them but usually his fits of abstraction were followed by bursts of gaiety that chased away the shadow before it chilled her she was still thinking of the ten dollars he had handed to the driver of the it had given them twenty minutes of pleasure and it seemed unimaginable that anyone should be able to buy amusement at that rate with ten dollars he might have bought her an engagement ring she knew that mrs tom fry's which came from springfield and had a diamond in it had cost only eight but she did not know why the thought had occurred to her harney would never buy her an engagement ring they were friends and comrades but no more he had been perfectly fair to her he had never said a word to mislead her she wondered what the girl was like whose hand was waiting for his ring boats were beginning to thicken on the lake and the clang of incessantly arriving trolleys announced the return of the crowds from the the shadows lengthened across the water and two white clouds near the sun were turning golden on the opposite shore men were hammering hastily at a wooden scaffolding in a field charity asked what it was for why the fireworks i suppose there'll be a big show harney looked at her and a smile crept into his moody eyes have you never seen any good fireworks miss hatchard always sends up lovely rockets on the fourth she answered doubtfully oh his contempt was unbounded i mean a big performance like this illuminated boats and all the rest she flushed at the picture do they send them up from the lake too rather didn't you notice that big raft we passed it's wonderful to see the rockets completing their orbits down under one's feet she said nothing and he put the oars into the rowlocks if we stay we'd better go and pick up something to eat but how can we get back afterwards she ventured feeling it would break her heart if she missed it he consulted a found a ten o'clock train and reassured her the moon rises so late that it will be dark by eight and we'll have over an hour of it twilight fell and lights began to show along the shore the trolleys roaring out from nettleton became great luminous serpents coiling in and out among the trees the wooden at the lake's edge danced with lanterns and the dusk echoed with laughter and shouts and the clumsy splashing of oars harney and charity had found a table in the corner of a balcony built over the lake and were patiently awaiting an unattainable chowder close under them the water lapped the piles agitated by the evolutions of a little white steamboat trellised with coloured globes which was to run passengers up and down the lake it was already black with them as it sheered off on its first trip suddenly charity heard a woman's laugh behind her the sound was familiar and she turned to look a band of showily dressed girls and dapper young men wearing badges of secret societies with new straw hats tilted far back on their hair had invaded the balcony and were loudly clamouring for a table the girl in the lead was the one who had laughed she wore a large hat with a long white feather and from under its brim her painted eyes looked at charity with amused recognition say if this ain't like old home week she remarked to the girl at her elbow and giggles and glances passed between them charity knew at once that the girl with the white feather was julia hawes she had lost her freshness and the paint under her eyes made her face seem thinner but her lips had the same lovely curve and the same cold mocking smile as if there were some secret absurdity in the person she was looking at and she had instantly detected it father goriot mme vauquer nee de conflans is an elderly person who for the past forty years has kept a in the rue in the district that lies between the latin quarter and the faubourg her house known in the neighborhood as the maison vauquer receives men and women old and young and no word has ever been breathed against her respectable establishment but at the same time it must be said that as a matter of fact no young woman has been under her roof for thirty years and that if a young man stays there for any length of time it is a sure sign that his allowance must be of the slenderest in however the time when this drama opens there was an almost penniless young girl among mme boarders that word drama has been somewhat discredited of late it has been overworked and twisted to strange uses in these days of dolorous literature but it must do service again here not because this story is dramatic in the restricted sense of the word but because some tears may perhaps be shed intra et extra muros before it is over will any one without the walls of paris understand it it is open to doubt the only audience who could appreciate the results of close observation the careful reproduction of minute detail and local color are dwellers between the heights of montrouge and montmartre in a vale of crumbling stucco watered by streams of black mud a vale of sorrows which are real and joys too often hollow but this audience is so accustomed to terrible sensations that only some unimaginable and impossible woe could produce any lasting impression there now and again there are tragedies so awful and so grand by reason of the complication of virtues and vices that bring them about that egotism and selfishness are forced to pause and are moved to pity but the impression that they receive is like a luscious fruit soon consumed civilization like the car of juggernaut is scarcely stayed perceptibly in its progress by a heart less easy to break than the others that lie in its course this also is broken and civilization continues on her course triumphant and you too will do the like you who with this book in your white hand will sink back among the cushions of your armchair and say to yourself perhaps this may amuse me you will read the story of father secret woes and dining thereafter with an unspoiled appetite will lay the blame of your insensibility upon the writer and accuse him of exaggeration of writing romances ah once for all this drama is neither a fiction nor a romance all is true so true that every one can discern the elements of the tragedy in his own house perhaps in his own heart the is mme own property it is still standing in the lower end of the rue just where the road slopes so sharply down to the rue de that wheeled traffic seldom passes that way because it is so stony and steep this position is sufficient to account for the silence prevalent in the streets shut in between the dome of the pantheon and the dome of the two conspicuous public buildings which give a yellowish tone to the landscape and darken the whole district that lies beneath the shadow of their cupolas in that district the pavements are clean and dry there is neither mud nor water in the gutters grass grows in the chinks of the walls the most heedless feels the depressing influences of a place where the sound of wheels creates a sensation there is a grim look about the houses a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls a parisian straying into a suburb apparently composed of and public institutions would see poverty and dullness old age lying down to die and joyous youth condemned to drudgery it is the ugliest quarter of paris and it may be added the least known but before all things the rue is like a bronze frame for a picture for which the mind cannot be too well prepared by the contemplation of sad hues and sober images even so step by step the daylight decreases and the droning voice grows hollower as the traveler descends into the catacombs the comparison holds good who shall say which is more ghastly the sight of the bleached skulls or of human hearts the front of the is at right angles to the road and looks out upon a little garden so that you see the side of the house in section as it were from the rue beneath the wall of the house front there lies a channel a fathom wide paved with and beside it runs a graveled walk bordered by geraniums and oleanders and pomegranates set in great blue and white glazed earthenware pots access into the graveled walk is afforded by a door above which the words maison vauquer may be read and beneath in rather smaller letters lodgings for both sexes etc during the day a glimpse into the garden is easily obtained through a wicket to which a bell is attached on the opposite wall at the further end of the graveled walk a green marble arch was painted once upon a time by a local artist and in this semblance of a shrine a statue representing cupid is installed a parisian cupid so blistered and disfigured that he looks like a candidate for one of the adjacent hospitals and might suggest an allegory to lovers of symbolism the inscription on the pedestal beneath determines the date of this work of art for it bears witness to the widespread enthusiasm felt for voltaire on his return to paris in the atheist's mass bianchon a physician to whom science owes a fine system of theoretical physiology and who while still young made himself a celebrity in the medical school of paris that central luminary to which european doctors do homage practised surgery for a long time before he took up medicine his earliest studies were guided by one of the greatest of french surgeons the illustrious desplein who flashed across science like a meteor by the consensus even of his enemies he took with him to the tomb an incommunicable method like all men of genius he had no heirs he carried everything in him and carried it away with him the glory of a surgeon is like that of an actor they live only so long as they are alive and their talent leaves no trace when they are gone actors and surgeons like great singers too like the executants who by their performance increase the power of music tenfold are all the heroes of a moment desplein is a case in proof of this resemblance in the destinies of such transient genius his name yesterday so famous almost forgotten will survive in his special department without crossing its limits for must there not be some extraordinary circumstances to exalt the name of a professor from the history of science to the general history of the human race had desplein that universal command of knowledge which makes a man the living word the great figure of his age desplein had a godlike eye he saw into the sufferer and his malady by an intuition natural or acquired which enabled him to grasp the diagnostics peculiar to the individual to determine the very time the hour the minute when an operation should be performed making due allowance for atmospheric conditions and peculiarities of individual temperament to proceed thus hand in hand with nature had he then studied the constant assimilation by living beings of the elements contained in the atmosphere or yielded by the earth to man who absorbs them deriving from them a particular expression of life did he work it all out by the power of deduction and analogy to which we owe the genius of cuvier be this as it may this man was in all the secrets of the human frame he knew it in the past and in the future emphasizing the present but did he epitomize all science in his own person as hippocrates did and galen and aristotle did he guide a whole school towards new worlds no though it is impossible to deny that this persistent observer of human chemistry possessed that antique science of the mages that is to say knowledge of the elements in fusion the causes of life life antecedent to life and what it must be in its incubation or ever it is it must be confessed that unfortunately everything in him was purely personal isolated during his life by his egoism that egoism is now suicidal of his glory on his tomb there is no proclaiming statue to repeat to posterity the mysteries which genius seeks out at its own cost but perhaps desplein's genius was answerable for his beliefs and for that reason mortal to him the terrestrial atmosphere was a generative envelope he saw the earth as an egg within its shell and not being able to determine whether the egg or the hen first was he would not recognize either the cock or the egg he believed neither in the antecedent animal nor the surviving spirit of man desplein had no doubts he was positive his bold and unqualified atheism was like that of many scientific men the best men in the world but invincible atheists atheists such as religious people declare to be impossible this opinion could scarcely exist otherwise in a man who was accustomed from his youth to dissect the creature above all others before during and after life to hunt through all his organs without ever finding the individual soul which is indispensable to religious theory when he detected a cerebral centre a nervous centre and a centre for aerating the blood the first two so perfectly complementary that in the latter years of his life he came to a conviction that the sense of hearing is not absolutely necessary for hearing nor the sense of sight for seeing and that the solar plexus could supply their place without any possibility of doubt desplein thus finding two souls in man confirmed his atheism by this fact though it is no evidence against god this man died it is said in final impenitence as do unfortunately many noble geniuses whom god may forgive the life of this man great as he was was marred by many meannesses to use the expression employed by his enemies who were anxious to diminish his glory but which it would be more proper to call apparent contradictions envious people and fools having no knowledge of the determinations by which superior spirits are moved seize at once on superficial inconsistencies to formulate an accusation and so to pass sentence on them if subsequently the proceedings thus attacked are crowned with success showing the correlations of the preliminaries and the results a few of the vanguard of calumnies always survive in our day for instance napoleon was condemned by our contemporaries when he spread his eagle's wings to alight in england only could explain and the flatboats at boulogne seven long years and more it at greek and latin four years at his probations and his negations the fine statue still lying in the middle of the marble block and nothing done but his tools sharpened to hew it out a piteous delay was not the great julius scaliger within an ace of never getting his tools sharpened at all years old was he before he could manage his greek and peter damianus lord bishop of ostia as all the world knows could not so much as read when he was of man's estate and baldus himself as eminent as he turned out after entered upon the law so late in life that every body imagined he intended to be an advocate in the other world no wonder when eudamidas the son of archidamas heard xenocrates at disputing about wisdom that he asked gravely if the old man be yet disputing and enquiring concerning wisdom what time will he have to make use of it yorick listened to my father with great attention there was a seasoning of wisdom unaccountably mixed up with his strangest whims and he had sometimes such illuminations in the darkest of his eclipses as almost atoned for them be wary sir when you imitate him i am convinced yorick continued my father half reading and half discoursing that there is a passage to the intellectual world and that the soul of man has shorter ways of going to work in furnishing itself with knowledge and instruction than we generally take with it but alack all fields have not a river or a spring running besides them every child yorick has not a parent to point it out the whole entirely depends added my father in a low voice upon the auxiliary verbs mr yorick had yorick trod upon virgil's snake he could not have looked more surprised i am surprised too cried my father observing it and i reckon it as one of the greatest calamities which ever befel the republic of letters that those who have been entrusted with the education of our children and whose business it was to open their minds and stock them early with ideas in order to set the imagination loose upon them have made so little use of the auxiliary verbs in doing it as they have done so that except raymond lullius and the elder pelegrini the last of which arrived to such perfection in the use of em with his topics that in a few lessons he could teach a young gentleman to discourse with plausibility upon any subject pro and con and to say and write all that could be spoken or written concerning it without blotting a word to the admiration of all who beheld him i should be glad said yorick interrupting my father to be made to comprehend this matter you shall said my father the highest stretch of improvement a single word is capable of is a high metaphor for which in my opinion the idea is generally the worse and not the better but be that as it may when the mind has done that with it there is an end the mind and the idea are at rest until a second idea enters and so on now the use of the auxiliaries is at once to set the soul by herself upon the materials as they are brought her and by the versability of this great engine round which they are twisted to open new tracts of enquiry and make every idea engender millions you excite my curiosity greatly said yorick for my own part quoth my uncle toby i have given it up the danes an please your honour quoth the corporal who were on the left at the siege of limerick were all auxiliaries and very good ones said my uncle toby but the auxiliaries trim my brother is talking about i conceive to be different things you do said my father rising up chapter xliii my father took a single turn across the room then sat down and finished the chapter the verbs auxiliary we are concerned in here continued my father are am was have had do did make made suffer shall should will would can could owe ought used or is wont and these varied with tenses present past future and conjugated with the verb see or with these questions added to them is it was it will it be would it be may it be might it be and these again put negatively is it not was it not ought it not or affirmatively it is it was it ought to be or chronologically has it been always lately how long ago or hypothetically if it was if it was not what would follow if the french should beat the english if the sun go out of the zodiac now by the right use and application of these continued my father in which a child's memory should be exercised there is no one idea can enter his brain how barren soever but a magazine of conceptions and conclusions may be drawn forth from it didst thou ever see a white bear cried my father turning his head round to trim who stood at the back of his chair no an please your honour replied the corporal but thou couldst discourse about one trim said my father in case of need how is it possible brother quoth my uncle toby if the corporal never saw one the fact i want replied my father and the possibility of it is as follows the great race well remarked mr sharp when tom and mr damon had called on him to state that andy foger's machine was now on the grounds and demanding to be allowed to view it to see if it was an infringement on the one entered by the young inventor i'll do the best i can for you i'll lay the case before the committee it will meet at once and i'll let you know what they say understand said tom i don't want to interfere unless i am convinced that andy is trying an underhand trick my plans are missing and i think he took them if his machine is made after those plans it is obviously a steal and i want him ruled out of the meet and so he shall be exclaimed mr sharp get the evidence against him and we'll act quickly enough the committee met in about an hour and considered the case meanwhile tom and mr damon strolled past the tent with its flaring sign there was a man on guard but andy was not in sight then tom was sent for and mr sharp told him what conclusion had been arrived at it was this under the rules of the meet said the balloonist we had to guarantee privacy to all the contestants until such time as they choose to exhibit their machines that is they need not bring them out until just before the races he added this is not a handicap affair and the speediest machine or the one that goes to the greatest height according to which class it enters will win in consequence we cannot force any contestant to declare what kind of a machine he will use until he gets ready some are going to use the familiar type of biplanes and as you can see there is no secret about them they are trying them out now this was so for several machines of this type were either in the air circling about or were being run over the ground but others continued mr sharp will not even take the committee into their confidence until just before the race they want to keep their craft a secret we can't compel them to do otherwise i'm sorry tom but the only thing i see for you to do is to wait until the last minute then if you find andy has infringed on your machine lodge a protest that is unless you can get evidence against him before that time tom well knew the uselessness of the latter plan he and mr damon had tried several times to get a glimpse of the craft andy had made but without success as to the other alternative that of waiting until the last moment tom feared that too would be futile for he reasoned just before the race there will be a lot of confusion officials will be here and there scattered over the ground they will be hard to find and it will be almost useless to protest then andy will enter the race and there is a possibility that he may win almost any one could with a machine like the it's the machine almost as much as the operator in a case like this but you can protest after the race suggested mr damon that would be little good in case andy beat me the public would say i was a sorehead and jealous no i've either got to stop andy before the race or not at all i will try to think of a plan tom did think of several but abandoned them one after the other he tried to get a glimpse inside the tent where the foger aeroplane was housed but it was too closely guarded andy himself was not much in evidence and tom only had fleeting glimpses of the bully meanwhile he and mr damon together with their machinist were kept busy as tom's craft was fully protected by patents now he had no hesitation in taking it out and it was given several severe tests around the aerial course it did even better than tom expected of it and he had great hopes always though there were two things that worried him one was his father's illness and the other the uneasiness he felt as to what andy foger might do as to the former the wireless reports indicated that mr swift was doing as well as could be expected but his improvement was not rapid regarding the latter worry tom saw no way of getting rid of it i've just got to wait that's all he thought the day before the opening of the meet tom and mr damon had given the a grueling tryout they had taken her high up so high that no prying eyes could time them and there tom had opened the motor for all the power in it they had flashed through space at the rate of one hundred and twenty miles an hour if we can only do that in the race the ten thousand dollars is mine exulted tom as he slanted the nose of the aeroplane toward the earth the day of the race dawned clear and beautiful tom was up early for there remained many little things to do to get his craft in final trim for the contest then too he wanted to be ready to act promptly as soon as andy's machine was wheeled out and he also wanted to get a message from home susan henchard her husband regarded the paper as if it were a through which he saw for miles his lips twitched and he seemed to compress his frame as if to bear better his usual habit was not to consider whether destiny were hard upon him or not the shape of his ideals in cases of affliction being simply a moody i am to suffer i perceive this much scourging then it is for me but now through his passionate head there stormed this thought that the blasting disclosure was what he had deserved his extreme reluctance to have the name altered from newson to henchard was now accounted for fully it furnished another illustration of that honesty in dishonesty which had characterized her in other things he remained unnerved and purposeless for near a couple of hours till he suddenly said ah i wonder if it is true he jumped up in an impulse kicked off his slippers and went with a candle to the door of room where he put his ear to the keyhole and listened she was breathing profoundly henchard softly turned the handle entered and shading the light approached the bedside gradually bringing the light from behind a screening curtain he held it in such a manner that it fell slantwise on her face without shining on her eyes he steadfastly regarded her features they were fair his were dark but this was an unimportant preliminary in sleep there come to the surface buried genealogical facts ancestral curves dead traits which the mobility of daytime animation screens and overwhelms in the present statuesque repose of the young countenance richard was unmistakably reflected he could not endure the sight of her and hastened away misery taught him nothing more than defiant endurance of it his wife was dead and the first impulse for revenge died with the thought that she was beyond him he looked out at the night as at a fiend henchard like all his kind was superstitious and he could not help thinking that the concatenation of events this evening had produced was the scheme of some sinister intelligence bent on punishing him yet they had developed naturally if he had not revealed his past history to elizabeth he would not have searched the drawer for papers and so on the mockery was that he should have no sooner taught a girl to claim the shelter of his paternity than he discovered her to have no kinship with him this ironical sequence of things angered him like an impish trick from a like prester his table had been spread and infernal harpies had snatched up the food he went out of the house and moved sullenly onward down the pavement till he came to the bridge at the bottom of the high street here he turned in upon a bypath on the river bank skirting the limits of the town these precincts embodied the mournful phases of casterbridge life as the south avenues embodied its cheerful moods the whole way along here was sunless even in summer time in spring white frosts lingered here when other places were steaming with warmth while in winter it was the of all the aches rheumatisms and torturing cramps of the year the casterbridge doctors must have pined away for want of sufficient nourishment but for the configuration of the landscape on the side the river slow noiseless and dark the schwarzwasser of casterbridge ran beneath a low cliff the two together forming a defence which had rendered walls and artificial earthworks on this side unnecessary here were ruins of a franciscan priory and a mill attached to the same the water of which roared down a like the voice of desolation above the cliff and behind the river rose a pile of buildings and in the front of the pile a square mass cut into the sky it was like a pedestal lacking its statue this missing feature without which the design remained incomplete was in truth the corpse of a man for the square mass formed the base of the gallows the extensive buildings at the back being the county gaol in the meadow where henchard now walked the mob were wont to gather whenever an execution took place and there to the tune of the roaring weir they stood and watched the spectacle the exaggeration which darkness imparted to the glooms of this region impressed henchard more than he had expected the lugubrious harmony of the spot with his domestic situation was too perfect for him impatient of effects scenes and adumbrations it reduced his heartburning to melancholy and he exclaimed why the deuce did i come here he went on past the cottage in which the old local hangman had lived and died in times before that calling was monopolized over all england by a single gentleman and climbed up by a steep back lane into the town for the sufferings of that night engendered by his bitter disappointment he might well have been pitied he was like one who had half fainted and could neither recover nor complete the swoon in words he could blame his wife but not in his heart and had he obeyed the wise directions outside her letter this pain would have been spared him for long possibly for ever seeming to show no ambition to quit her safe and secluded maiden courses for the speculative path of matrimony wherein edith carr wages a battle and hart henderson stands guard many people looked a few followed when edith carr slowly came down the main street of mackinac pausing here and there to note the glow of colour in one small booth after another overflowing with gay curios that street of packed white sand winding with the curves of the shore outlined with brilliant shops and thronged with laughing people in outing costumes was a picturesque and fascinating sight thousands annually made long journeys and paid exorbitant prices to take part in that pageant as edith carr passed she was the most distinguished figure of the old street her clinging black gown was sufficiently elaborate for a dinner dress on her head was a large wide black hat with immense floating black plumes while on the brim and among the laces on her breast glowed velvety deep red roses some way these made up for the lack of colour in her cheeks and lips and while her eyes seemed unnaturally bright to a close observer they appeared weary despite the effort she made to move lightly she was very tired and dragged her heavy feet with an effort she turned at the little street leading to the dock and went to meet the big lake steamer ploughing up the straits from chicago past the landing place on to the very end of the pier she went then sat down leaned against a dock support and closed her tired eyes when the steamer came very close she languidly watched the people lining the railing instantly she marked one lean anxious face turned toward hers and with a throb of pity she lifted a hand and waved to hart henderson he was the first man to leave the boat coming to her instantly she spread her trailing skirts and motioned him to sit beside her silently they looked across the softly lapping water at last she forced herself to speak to him did you have a successful trip i accomplished my purpose you didn't lose any time getting back i never do when i am coming to you do you want to go to the cottage for anything no then let us sit here and wait until the petoskey steamer comes in i like to watch the boats sometimes i study the faces if i am not too tired have you seen any new types she shook her head this has not been an easy day hart and it's going to be worse said henderson bitterly there's no use putting it off edith i saw some one you should have seen thousands she said lightly i did but of them all only one will be of interest to you man or woman man where lake shore private hospital an accident no nervous and physical breakdown phil said he was going back to the limberlost he went he was there three weeks but the strain broke him he has an old letter in his hands that he has handled until it is ragged he held it up to me and said you can see for yourself that she says she will be well and happy but we can't know until we see her again and that may never be she may have gone too near that place her father went down some of that limberlost gang may have found her in the forest she may lie dead in some city morgue this instant waiting for me to find her body hart for pity sake stop i can't cried henderson desperately i am forced to tell you they are fighting brain fever he did go back to the swamp and he prowled it night and day the days down there are hot now and the nights wet with dew and cold he paid no attention and forgot his food a fever started and his uncle brought him home they've never had a word from her or found a trace of her mrs comstock thought she had gone to o'mores at great rapids so when phil broke down she telegraphed there they had been gone all summer so her mother is as anxious as phil the o'mores are here said edith i haven't seen any of them because i haven't gone out much in the few days since we came but this is their summer home edith they say at the hospital that it will take careful nursing to save phil he is surrounded by stacks of maps and railroad guides he is trying to frame up a plan to set the entire detective agency of the country to work he says he will stay there just two days longer the doctors say he will kill himself when he goes he is a sick man edith his hands are burning and shaky and his breath was hot against my face why are you telling me it was a cry of acute anguish he thinks you know where she is i do not i haven't an idea i never dreamed she would go away when she had him in her hand i should not have done it he said it was something you said to her that made her go that may be but it doesn't prove that i know where she went skipped to canada rumors have been rife for some time affecting the business standing of mr benjamin fielding the well known commission merchant yesterday it was discovered that he had left the city but where he has gone is unknown it is believed that he is very deeply involved and seeing no way out of his embarrassment has skipped to canada or perhaps taken passage to europe probably his creditors will appoint a committee to look into his affairs and report what can be done later an open letter has been found in mr desk addressed to his creditors it expresses regret for their losses and promises if his life is spared and fortune favors him to do all in his power to make them good no one doubts mr integrity and regrets are expressed that he did not remain in the city and help unravel the tangle in which his affairs are involved he is a man of ability and as he is still in the prime of life it may be that he will be able to redeem his promises and pay his debts in full if sufficient time is given him i can get no help or advice from mr fielding thought rodney i am thrown upon my own resources and must fight the battle of life as well as i can alone he got out in front of the astor house as he left the car he soiled his shoes with the mud so characteristic of new york streets shine your boots asked a young arab glancing with a business eye at spattered shoes rodney accepted his offer not so much because he thought the blacking would last as for the opportunity of questioning the free and independent young citizen who was doing what he hoped to do that is making a living for himself is business good with you asked rodney it ought to be with the street in this condition yes me and de street commissioner is in league together he makes business good for me and do you pay him a commission asked rodney smiling i tell no official secrets

jay gould cleaned me out and i suppose now he has added your fortune to his hit it boss well good day mike see you again some day all right in my office all de mornin chapter vi an impudent adventurer while rodney was talking with mike flynn he was an object of attention to a man who stood near the corner of barclay street and was ostensibly looking in at the window of the drug store as rodney turned away he recognized him at once as his enterprising fellow traveler who had taken possession of the casket of jewels he did not care to keep up an acquaintance with him and started to cross the street but the other came forward smiling and with a nod said i believe you are the young man i met yesterday in the cars and afterwards at kentville chapter xi there was a welcome change in the weather when i rose early next morning the sky was without cloud and had that purity in its colour and look of infinite distance seen only when the atmosphere is free from vapour the sun had not yet risen but old nuflo was already among the ashes on his hands and knees blowing the embers he had uncovered to a flame then rima appeared only to pass through the room with quick light tread to go out of the door without a word or even a glance at my face the old man after watching at the door for a few minutes turned and began eagerly questioning me about my adventures on the previous evening in reply i related to him how the girl had found me in the forest lost and unable to extricate myself from the tangled undergrowth he rubbed his hands on his knees and chuckled happy for you senor he said that my granddaughter regards you with such friendly eyes otherwise you might have perished before morning once she was at your side no light whether of sun or moon or lantern was needed nor that small instrument which is said to guide a man aright in the desert even in the darkest night let him that can believe such a thing yes happy for me i returned i am filled with remorse that it was all through my fault that the poor child was exposed to such weather o senor he cried airily let not that distress you rain and wind and hot suns from which we seek shelter do not harm her she takes no cold and no fever with or without ague after some further conversation i left him to steal away unobserved on his own account and set out for a ramble in the hope of encountering rima and winning her to talk to me my quest did not succeed not a glimpse of her delicate shadowy form did i catch among the trees and not one note from her melodious lips came to gladden me at noon i returned to the house where i found food placed ready for me and knew that she had come there during my absence and had not been forgetful of my wants shall i thank you for this i said i ask you for heavenly nectar for the sustentation of the higher winged nature in me and you give me a boiled sweet potato toasted strips of pumpkins and a handful of parched maize rima rima my woodland fairy my sweet saviour why do you yet fear me is it that love struggles in you with repugnance can you discern with clear spiritual eyes the grosser elements in me and hate them or has some false imagination made me appear all dark and evil but too late for your peace after the sweet sickness of love has infected you but she was not there to answer me and so after a time i went forth again and seated myself listlessly on the root of an old tree not far from the house i had sat there a full hour when all at once rima appeared at my side bending forward she touched my hand but without glancing at my face come with me she said and turning moved swiftly towards the northern extremity of the forest she seemed to take it for granted that i would follow never casting a look behind nor pausing in her rapid walk but i was only too glad to obey and starting up was quickly after her she led me by easy ways familiar to her with many doublings to escape the undergrowth never speaking or pausing until we came out from the thick forest and i found myself for the first time at the foot of the great hill or mountain ytaioa glancing back for a few moments she waved a hand towards the summit and then at once began the ascent here too it seemed all familiar ground to her from below the sides had presented an exceedingly rugged appearance a wild confusion of huge jagged rocks mixed with a tangled vegetation of trees bushes and vines but following her in all her doublings it became easy enough although it fatigued me greatly owing to our rapid pace the hill was conical but i found that it had a flat top an oblong or area almost level of a soft crumbly sandstone with a few blocks and boulders of a harder stone scattered about and no vegetation except the grey mountain lichen and a few dwarf shrubs here rima at a distance of a few yards from me remained standing still for some minutes as if to give me time to recover my breath and i was right glad to sit down on a stone to rest finally she walked slowly to the centre of the level area which was about two acres in extent rising i followed her and climbing on to a huge block of stone began gazing at the wide prospect spread out before me the day was windless and bright with only a few white clouds floating at a great height above and casting travelling shadows over that wild broken country where forest marsh and savannah were only distinguishable by their different colours like the greys and greens and yellows on a map at a great distance the circle of the horizon was broken here and there by mountains but the hills in our neighbourhood were all beneath our feet rescued for a moment ned and mr damon gazed at the farmer in his rattletrap of an auto and then they looked at the fluttering piece of paper in his hand thence their gaze traveled to the ragged and barefoot lad sitting beside the farmer i found it announced the boy found what asked ned that there note without asking any more questions reserving them until they knew more about the matter mr damon and ned each reached out a hand for the paper the farmer held the latter handed it to ned being nearest him and at a sight of the handwriting the young bank clerk exclaimed it's from tom all right what happened to him cried mr damon where is he is he a prisoner so it seems answered ned wait i'll read it to you and he read whoever picks this up please send word at once to mr swift or to ned newton in shopton or to mr damon of waterfield i am a prisoner locked in the old factory tom swift bless my quinine pills cried mr damon what in the world does it mean what factory that's just what we've got to find out decided ned where did you get this he asked the farmer's boy way off over there and he pointed across miles of fields i was lookin for a lost cow and i went past an old factory there wasn't nobody in the place as far as i knowed but all at once i heard some one yell and then i seen something white like a bird sail out of a high window i was scared for a minute thinkin it might be tramps after me and what did you do sonny asked mr damon as the boy paused well after a while i went to where the white thing lay and i picked it up i seen it was a piece of paper with writin on it and it was wrapped around part of a brick and did you go near the factory to find out who called or who threw the paper out ned queried i didn't the boy answered i was scared i went home and didn't even start to find the lost cow no more he did chimed in the farmer he come runnin in like a whitehead and as soon as i saw the paper and heard what bub had to say i thought maybe i'd better do somethin did you go to the factory asked ned eagerly no i thought the best thing to do would be to find this mr swift or the other folks mentioned in this letter i knowed in a general way where shopton was but i'd never been there doing my tradin in the other direction and so i had to stop and ask the road if you can tell me we're two of the persons spoken of in that note said mr damon as he mentioned his name and introduced ned we have been looking for our friend tom swift for two days now we must find him at once as there is no telling what he may be suffering where is this old factory you speak of continued mr damon and how can we get there it's too bad one of you didn't go back after finding the note to tell tom he was soon to be rescued waal maybe it is said the farmer a bit put out by the criticism but i figgered it would be better to look up this young man's friends and let them do the rescuin and not lose no time specially as it's about as far from my place to the factory as it is to shopton well i suppose that's so agreed ned but what is this factory it's an old one where they started to make beet sugar but it didn't pan out the farmer said the place is in ruins and i did hear not long ago that somebody run a threshin machine through it an busted it up worse than before great horned toads cried ned that must be the very factory tom ran his tank through and to think he should be a prisoner there held by whom do you suppose asked mr damon by that blakeson gang i imagine ned answered there's no time to lose we must go to his rescue of course agreed mr damon we're much obliged to you for bringing this note he went on to the farmer and here is something to repay you for your trouble and he took out his wallet shucks i didn't do this for pay objected the farmer it's a pity i wouldn't help anybody what's in trouble if i'd what it meant me and bub here would have gone to the factory ourselves maybe and done the work quicker but i didn't know what with war times and but that it would be better to deliver the note it turns out as well perhaps agreed ned we'll look after tom now and i'll come along and help said the farmer if there's a gang of tramps in that factory you may need some reinforcements i've got a couple of new axe handles in my machine and they'll come in mighty handy as clubs chapter xviii meanwhile the months slipped by the trade blew itself out the monsoon had begun to breathe and jerry added to himself six months of time weight stature and thickness of bone an easy time his half year with the blind man had been despite the fact that nalasu was a rigid disciplinarian who insisted on training jerry for longer hours day in and day out than falls to the lot of most dogs never did jerry receive from him a blow never a harsh word this man who had slain four of the annos three of them after he had gone blind who had slain still more men in his savage youth never raised his voice in anger to jerry and ruled him by nothing severer than the gentlest of chidings mentally the persistent education jerry received in this period of late puppyhood fixed in him increased brain power for all his life possibly no dog in all the world had ever been so vocal as he and for three reasons his own intelligence the genius for teaching that was nalasu's and the long hours devoted to the teaching his shorthand vocabulary for a dog was prodigious almost might it be said that he and the man could talk by the hour although few and simple were the abstractions they could talk very little of the immediate concrete past and scarcely anything of the immediate concrete future entered into their conversations jerry could no more tell him of meringe nor of the arangi than could he tell him of the great love he had borne skipper or of his reason for hating bashti by the same token nalasu could not tell jerry of the with the annos nor of how he had lost his eyesight practically all their conversation was confined to the instant present although they could compass a little of the very immediate past nalasu would give jerry a series of instructions such as going on a scout by himself to go to the nest then circle about it widely to continue to the other clearing where were the fruit trees to cross the jungle to the main path to proceed down the main path toward the village till he came to the great banyan tree and then to return along the small path to nalasu and nalasu's house all of which jerry would carry out to the letter and arrived back would make report as thus at the nest nothing unusual save that a buzzard was near it in the other clearing three coconuts had fallen to the ground for jerry could count unerringly up to five between the other clearing and the main path were four pigs along the main path he had passed a dog more than five women and two children and on the small path home he had noted a cockatoo and two boys but he could not tell nalasu his states of mind and heart that prevented him from being fully contented in his present situation for nalasu was not a but only a mere nigger god and jerry hated and despised all niggers save for the two exceptions of lamai and nalasu he tolerated them and for nalasu had even developed a placid and sweet affection love him he did not and could not at the best they were only gods and he could not forget the great such as skipper and mister haggin and of the same breed derby and bob they were something else something other something better than all this black savagery in which he lived they were above and beyond in an unattainable paradise which he vividly remembered for which he yearned but to which he did not know the way and which dimly sensing the ending that comes to all things might have passed into the ultimate nothingness which had already overtaken skipper and the arangi in vain did the old man play to gain jerry's heart of love he could not bid against jerry's many reservations and memories although he did win absolute faithfulness and loyalty not passionately as he would have fought to the death for skipper but devotedly would he have fought to the death for nalasu and the old man never dreamed but what he had won all of jerry's heart came the day of the annos when one of them made the invention which was sandals to armour the soles of their feet against the poisoned thorns with which nalasu had taken three of their lives the day in truth was the night a black night a night so black under a sky that a could not be seen an eighth of an inch beyond one's nose and the annos descended on nalasu's clearing a dozen of them armed with sniders horse pistols tomahawks and war clubs walking gingerly despite their thick sandals because of fear of the thorns which nalasu no longer planted jerry sitting between nalasu's knees and nodding sleepily gave the first warning to nalasu who sat outside his door as he had sat through all the nights of the many years he listened still more tensely through long minutes in which he heard nothing at the same time whispering to jerry for information and commanding him to be and jerry with whuffs and whiffs and all the of speech he had been taught told him that men approached many men more men than five the leprechaun the shell carried us straight back to the house of yolara larry was awaiting me we stood again before the tenebrous wall where first we had faced the priestess and the voice and as we stood again the portal appeared with all its disconcerting magical abruptness but now the scene was changed around the jet table were grouped a number of figures lugur yolara beside him seven others all of them and all men save one who sat at the left of the priestess an old old woman how old i could not tell her face bearing traces of beauty that must once have been as great as yolara's own but now ravaged in some way awesome through its ruins the fearful malicious gaiety shining out like a spirit of joy held within a corpse began then our examination for such it was and as it progressed i was more and more struck by the change in the o'keefe all flippancy was gone rarely did his sense of humour reveal itself in any of his answers he was like a cautious swordsman fencing guarding studying his opponent or rather like a who keeps sensing some purpose in the game alert contained watchful always he stressed the power of our surface races their multitudes their solidarity their questions were myriad what were our occupations our system of government how great were the waters the land intensely interested were they in the world war querying minutely into its causes its effects in our weapons their interest was avid and they were exceedingly minute in their examination of us as to the ruins which had excited our curiosity their position and surroundings and if others than ourselves might be expected to find and pass through their entrance at this i shot a glance at lugur he did not seem unduly interested i wondered if the russian had told him as yet of the girl of the rosy wall of the moon pool chamber and the real reasons for our search then i answered as briefly as possible omitting all reference to these things the red dwarf watched me with unmistakable amusement and i knew marakinoff had told him but clearly lugur had kept his information even from yolara and as clearly she had spoken to none of that episode when automatic had shattered the vase again i felt that sense of deep bewilderment of helpless search for clue to all the tangle for two hours we were questioned and then the priestess called rador and let us go larry was sombre as we returned he walked about the room uneasily hell's brewing here all right he said at last stopping before me i can't make out just the particular brand that's all that bothers me we're going to have a stiff fight that's sure what i want to do quick is to find the golden girl doc haven't seen her on the wall lately have you he queried hopefully fantastic laugh if you want to he went on but she's our best bet it's going to be a race between her and the o'keefe banshee but i put my money on her i had a queer experience while i was in that garden after you'd left his voice grew solemn did you ever see a leprechaun doc i shook my head again as solemnly he's a little man in green said larry oh about as high as your knee i saw one once in carntogher woods and as i sat there half asleep in yolara's garden the living spit of him stepped out from one of those bushes twirling a little shillalah it's a tight box ye're gettin in larry avick said he but don't ye be downhearted lad i'm carrying on said i but you're a long way from ireland i said or thought i did ye've a lot o friends there he answered an where the heart rests the feet are swift to follow not that i'm sayin i'd like to live here larry said he i know where my heart is now i told him it rests on a girl with golden eyes and the hair and breast of eilidh the fair but me feet don't seem to get me to her i said the brogue thickened an the little man in green nodded his head an whirled his shillalah it's what i came to tell ye says he don't ye fall for the the serpent woman wit the blue eyes she's a daughter of ivor lad an don't ye do nothin to make the coleen ashamed o ye larry o'keefe i knew yer great great grandfather an his before him aroon says he an wan o the o'keefe

all cluttered up wid another's washin an mendin an cookin an other things pertainin to general wife work not that i think the wan is keen for mendin an cookin says he you don't have to be comin all this way to tell me that i answer well i'm just a tellin you he says ye've got some rough knocks comin larry in fact ye're in for a devil of a time but remember that ye're the o'keefe says he an while the bhoys are all wid ye avick ye've got to be on the job yourself viii monseigneur in the country a beautiful landscape with the corn bright in it but not abundant patches of poor rye where corn should have been patches of poor peas and beans patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat on inanimate nature as on the men and women who cultivated it a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly a dejected disposition to give up and wither away monsieur the marquis in his travelling carriage which might have been lighter conducted by four and two postilions fagged up a steep hill a blush on the countenance of monsieur the marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding it was not from within it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control the setting sun the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the that its occupant was steeped in crimson it will die out said monsieur the marquis glancing at his hands directly in effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment when the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage slid down hill with a cinderous smell in a cloud of dust the red glow departed quickly the sun and the marquis going down together there was no glow left when the drag was taken off but there remained a broken country bold and open a little village at the bottom of the hill a broad sweep and rise beyond it a a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on the marquis looked with the air of one who was coming near home the village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poor tannery poor tavern poor for relays of poor fountain all usual poor appointments it had its poor people too all its people were poor and many of them were sitting at their doors shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many were at the fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten expressive signs of what made them poor were not wanting the tax for the state the tax for the church the tax for the lord tax local and tax general were to be paid here and to be paid there according to solemn inscription in the little village until the wonder was that there was any village left unswallowed few children were to be seen and no dogs as to the men and women their choice on earth was stated in the prospect life on the lowest terms that could sustain it down in the little village under the mill or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of his postilions whips which twined about their heads in the evening air as if he came attended by the furies monsieur the marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the gate it was hard by the fountain and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him he looked at them and saw in them without knowing it the slow sure filing down of face and figure that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years monsieur the marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him as the like of himself had drooped before monseigneur of the court only the difference was that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate when a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group bring me hither that fellow said the marquis to the courier the fellow was brought cap in hand and the other fellows closed round to look and listen in the manner of the people at the paris fountain i passed you on the road monseigneur it is true i had the honour of being passed on the road coming up the hill and at the top of the hill both monseigneur it is true what did you look at so fixedly monseigneur i looked at the man he stooped a little and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage all his fellows stooped to look under the carriage what man pig and why look there pardon monseigneur he swung by the chain of the shoe the drag who demanded the traveller monseigneur the man may the devil carry away these idiots how do you call the man you know all the men of this part of the country who was he your clemency monseigneur he was not of this part of the country of all the days of my life i never saw him swinging by the chain to be suffocated with your gracious permission that was the wonder of it monseigneur his head hanging over like this he turned himself sideways to the carriage and leaned back with his face thrown up to the sky and his head hanging down then recovered himself fumbled with his cap and made a bow what was he like monseigneur he was whiter than the miller all covered with dust white as a spectre tall as a spectre joe wilson and his mates author of while the billy boils on the track and over the sliprails when the world was

is put into knickerbockers for instance and comes a man as my little jim used to say when cooking something at home that he likes when the or measles breaks out amongst the children or the teacher or his wife falls dangerously ill or dies it matter which and there no school when a boy is naked and in his natural state for a warm climate like australia with three or four of his schoolmates under the shade of the in the bend where a good clear pool with a sandy bottom when his father buys him a gun and he starts out after kangaroos or possums when he gets a horse saddle and bridle of his own when he has his arm in splints or a stitch in his head proud then the proudest boy in the district i a average boy i reckon i was born for a poet by mistake and grew up to be a bushman and know what was the matter with me or the world but got nothing to do with it there are times when a man is happy when he finds out that the girl loves him when just married when a lawful father for the first time and everything is going on all right some men make fools of themselves then i know i did happy because out of debt and can see clear ahead and because i been easy for a long time but i think that the happiest time in a life is when courting a girl and finds out for sure that she loves him and a thought for any one else make the most of your courting days you young chaps and keep them clean for about the only days when a chance of poetry and beauty coming into this life make the best of them and never regret it the longest day you live the days that the wife will look back to anyway in the brightest of times as well as in the blackest and there be anything in those days that might hurt her when she looks back make the most of your courting days you young chaps for they will never come again a married man knows all about it after a while he sees the woman world through the eyes of his wife he knows what an extra pressure of the hand means and if he has had a hard life and is inclined to be cynical the knowledge does him no good it leads him into awful messes sometimes for a married man if inclined that way has three times the chance with a woman that a single man has because the married man knows he is privileged he can guess pretty closely what a woman means when she says something else he knows just how far he can go he can go farther in five minutes towards coming to the point with a woman than an innocent young man dares go in three weeks above all the married man is more decided with women he takes them and things for granted in short he is well he is a married man and when he knows all this how much better or happier is he for it mark twain says that he lost all the beauty of the river when he saw it with a eye and there you have it the duchesse of langeais in a spanish city on an island in the mediterranean there stands a convent of the order of barefoot carmelites where the rule instituted by st theresa is still preserved with all the first rigor of the reformation brought about by that illustrious woman extraordinary as this may seem it is none the less true almost every religious house in the peninsula or in europe for that matter was either destroyed or disorganized by the outbreak of the french revolution and the napoleonic wars but as this island was protected through those times by the english fleet its wealthy convent and peaceable inhabitants were secure from the general trouble and spoliation the storms of many kinds which shook the first fifteen years of the nineteenth century spent their force before they reached those cliffs at so short a distance from the coast of andalusia if the rumour of the name so much as reached the shore of the island it is doubtful whether the holy women kneeling in the cloisters grasped the reality of his progress of glory or the majesty that blazed in flame across kingdom after kingdom during his meteor life in the minds of the roman catholic world the convent stood out for a stern discipline which nothing had changed the purity of its rule had attracted unhappy women from the furthest parts of europe women deprived of all human ties sighing after the long suicide accomplished in the breast of god no convent indeed was so well fitted for that complete detachment of the soul from all earthly things which is demanded by the religious life albeit on the continent of europe there are many convents magnificently adapted to the purpose of their existence buried away in the loneliest valleys hanging in on the steepest mountainsides set down on the brink of precipices in every place man has sought for the poetry of the infinite the solemn awe of silence in every place man has striven to draw closer to god seeking him on mountain peaks in the depths below the crags at the edge and everywhere man has found god but nowhere save on this ledge of rock could you find so many different harmonies combining so to raise the soul that the sharpest pain comes to be like other memories the strongest impressions are dulled till the sorrows of life are laid to rest in the depths the convent stands on the highest point of the crags at the uttermost end of the island on the side towards the sea the rock was once rent sheer away in some it rises up a straight wall from the base where the waves gnaw at the stone below mark any assault is made impossible by the dangerous reefs that stretch far out to sea with the sparkling waves of the mediterranean playing over them so only from the sea can you discern the square mass of the convent built conformably to the minute rules laid down as to the shape height doors and windows of monastic buildings from the side of the town the church completely hides the solid structure of the cloisters and their roofs covered with broad slabs of stone impervious to sun or storm or gales of wind the church itself built by the munificence of a spanish family is the crowning edifice of the town its fine bold front gives an imposing and picturesque look to the little city in the sea the sight of such a city with its roofs arranged for the most part above a picturesque harbour and crowned by a glorious cathedral front with gothic doorways belfry towers and filigree spires is a spectacle surely in every way the sublimest on earth religion towering above daily life to put men continually in mind of the end and the way is in truth a thoroughly spanish conception but now surround this picture by the mediterranean and a burning sky imagine a few palms here and there a few stunted evergreen trees mingling their waving leaves with the motionless flowers and foliage of carved stone look out over the reef with its white fringes of foam in contrast to the sapphire sea and then turn to the city with its galleries and terraces whither the townsfolk come to take the air among their flowers of an evening above the houses and the tops of the trees in their little gardens add a few sails down in the harbour and lastly in the stillness of falling night listen to the organ music the chanting of the services the wonderful sound of bells pealing out over the open sea there is sound and silence everywhere oftener still there is silence over all the church is divided within into a sombre mysterious nave and narrow aisles for some reason probably because the winds are so high the architect was unable to build the flying buttresses and intervening chapels which adorn almost all cathedrals nor are there openings of any kind in the walls which support the weight of the roof outside there is simply the heavy wall structure a solid mass of grey stone further strengthened by huge piers placed at intervals inside the nave and its little side galleries are lighted entirely by the great suspended by a miracle of art above the centre doorway for upon that side the exposure permits of the display of lacework in stone and of other beauties peculiar to the style improperly called gothic drink tom foster came to winesburg from cincinnati when he was still young and could get many new impressions his grandmother had been raised on a farm near the town and as a young girl had gone to school there when winesburg was a village of twelve or fifteen houses clustered about a general store on the trunion pike what a life the old woman had led since she went away from the frontier settlement and what a strong capable little old thing she was she had been in kansas in canada and in new york city traveling about with her husband a mechanic before he died later she went to stay with her daughter who had also married a mechanic and lived in covington kentucky across the river from cincinnati then began the hard years for tom foster's grandmother first her was killed by a policeman during a strike and then tom's mother became an invalid and died also the grandmother had saved a little money but it was swept away by the illness of the daughter and by the cost of the two funerals she became a half old woman worker and lived with the grandson above a junk shop on a side street in cincinnati for five years she scrubbed the floors in an office building and then got a place as dish washer in a restaurant her hands were all twisted out of shape when she took hold of a mop or a broom handle the hands looked like the dried stems of an old creeping vine clinging to a tree the old woman came back to winesburg as soon as she got the chance one evening as she was coming home from work she found a containing dollars and that opened the way the trip was a great adventure for the boy it was past seven o'clock at night when the grandmother came home with the held tightly in her old hands and she was so excited she could scarcely speak she insisted on leaving cincinnati that night saying that if they stayed until morning the owner of the money would be sure to find them out and make trouble tom who was then sixteen years old had to go trudging off to the station with the old woman bearing all of their earthly belongings done up in a blanket and slung across his back by his side walked the grandmother urging him forward her toothless old mouth twitched nervously and when tom grew weary and wanted to put the pack down at a street crossing she snatched it up and if he had not prevented would have slung it across her own back when they got into the train and it had run out of the city she was as delighted as a girl and talked as the boy had never heard her talk before all through the night as the train rattled along the grandmother told tom tales of winesburg and of how he would enjoy his life working in the fields and shooting wild things in the woods there she could not believe that the tiny village of fifty years before had grown into a thriving town in her absence and in the morning when the train came to winesburg did not want to get off it isn't what i thought it may be hard for you here she said and then the train went on its way and the two stood confused not knowing where to turn in the presence of albert longworth the winesburg baggage master but tom foster did get along all right he was one to get along anywhere mrs white the banker's wife employed his grandmother to work in the kitchen and he got a place as stable boy in the banker's new brick barn in winesburg servants were hard to get the woman who wanted help in her housework employed a hired girl who insisted on sitting at the table with the family mrs white was sick of hired girls and snatched at the chance to get hold of the old city woman she furnished a room for the boy tom upstairs in the barn he can mow the lawn and run errands when the horses do not need attention she explained to her husband tom foster was rather small for his age and had a large head covered with stiff black hair that stood straight up the hair emphasized the bigness of his head his voice was the softest thing imaginable and he was himself so gentle and quiet that he slipped into the life of the town without attracting the least bit of attention one could not help wondering where tom foster got his gentleness in cincinnati he had lived in a neighborhood where gangs of tough boys prowled through the streets and all through his early formative years he ran about with tough boys for a while he was a messenger for a telegraph company and delivered messages in a neighborhood sprinkled with houses of prostitution the women in the houses knew and loved tom foster and the tough boys in the gangs loved him also he never asserted himself that was one thing that helped him escape in an odd way he stood in the shadow of the wall of life was meant to stand in the shadow he saw the men and women in the houses of lust sensed their casual and horrible love affairs saw boys fighting and listened to their tales of thieving and drunkenness unmoved and strangely unaffected viii the crooked man one summer night a few months after my marriage i was seated by my own hearth smoking a last pipe and nodding over a novel for my work had been an exhausting one my wife had already gone upstairs and the sound of the locking of the hall door some time before told me that the servants had also retired i had risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my pipe when i suddenly heard the clang of the bell i looked at the clock it was a quarter to twelve this could not be a visitor at so late an hour a patient evidently and possibly an sitting with a wry face i went out into the hall and opened the door to my astonishment it was sherlock holmes who stood upon my step ah watson said he i hoped that i might not be too late to catch you my dear fellow pray come in you look surprised and no wonder relieved too i fancy hum you still smoke the arcadia mixture of your bachelor days then no mistaking that fluffy ash upon your coat easy to tell that you have been accustomed to wear a uniform watson never pass as a civilian as long as you keep that habit of carrying your handkerchief in your sleeve could you put me up with pleasure you told me that you had bachelor quarters for one and i see that you have no gentleman visitor at present your proclaims as much i shall be delighted if you will stay thank you fill the vacant peg then sorry to see that had the british workman in the house a token of evil not the drains i hope no the gas ah he has left two from his boot upon your linoleum just where the light strikes it no thank you i had some supper at waterloo but smoke a pipe with you with pleasure i handed him my pouch and he seated himself opposite to me and smoked for some time in silence i was well aware that nothing but business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour so i waited patiently until he should come round to it i see that you are professionally rather busy just now said he glancing very keenly across at me yes had a busy day i answered it may seem very foolish in your eyes i added but really i know how you deduced it holmes chuckled to himself i have the advantage of knowing your habits my dear watson said he when your round is a short one you walk and when it is a long one you use a hansom as i perceive that your boots although used are by no means dirty i cannot doubt that you are at present busy enough to justify the hansom excellent i cried elementary said he it is one of those instances where the reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his neighbour because the latter has missed the one little point which is the basis of the deduction the same may be said my dear fellow for the effect of some of these little sketches of yours which is entirely meretricious depending as it does upon your retaining in your own hands some factors in the problem which are never imparted to the reader now at present i am in the position of these same readers for i hold in this hand several threads of one of the strangest cases which ever perplexed a brain and yet i lack the one or two which are needful to complete my theory but have them watson have them his eyes kindled and a slight flush sprang into his thin cheeks for an instant only when i glanced again his face had resumed that composure which had made so many regard him as a machine rather than a man the problem presents features of interest said he i may even say exceptional features of interest i have already looked into the matter and have come as i think within sight of my solution if you could accompany me in that last step you might be of considerable service to me i should be delighted could you go as far as aldershot i have no doubt jackson would take my practice very good i want to start by the from waterloo that would give me time then if you are not too sleepy i will give you a sketch of what has happened and of what remains to be done i was sleepy before you came i am quite wakeful now i will compress the story as far as may be done without omitting anything vital to the case it is conceivable that you may even have read some account of the matter it is the supposed murder of colonel barclay of the royal mallows at aldershot which i am investigating contents chap page i soldier

a i have never seen one but i needed a in this book and a trustworthy one will be found in it i got it out of john castilian days reducing and condensing it to fit the requirements of this small story

is not original with me i got it out of herodotus herodotus says very few things happen at the right time and the rest do not happen at all the conscientious historian will correct these defects the

to himself i am buffalo horse i have spent my life under his saddle with him in it too and he is good for two hundred pounds without his clothes and there is no telling how much he does weigh when he is out on the and has his batteries belted on he is over six feet is young an ounce of waste flesh is straight graceful springy in his motions quick as a cat and has a handsome face and black hair dangling down on his shoulders and is beautiful to look at and nobody is braver than he is and nobody is stronger except myself yes a person that doubts that he is fine to see should see him in his beaded on my back and his rifle peeping above his shoulder chasing a hostile trail with me going like the wind and his hair streaming out behind from the shelter of his broad slouch yes he is a sight to look at then and part of it myself i am his favorite horse out of dozens big as he is i have carried him miles between nightfall and sunrise on the scout and i am good for fifty day in and day out and all the time i am not large but i am built on a business basis i have carried him thousands and thousands of miles on scout duty for the army and not a gorge nor a pass nor a valley nor a fort nor a trading post nor a in the whole sweep of the rocky mountains and the great plains that we know as well as we know the he is chief of scouts to the army of the frontier and it makes us very important in such a position as i hold in the military service one needs to be of good family and possess an education much above the common to be worthy of the place i am the horse outside of the hippodrome everybody says and the it may be so it is not for me to say modesty is the best policy i think buffalo bill taught me the most of what i know my mother taught me much and i taught myself the rest lay a row of moccasins before me pawnee sioux shoshone cheyenne blackfoot and as many other tribes as you please and i can name the tribe every moccasin belongs to by the make of it name it in and could do it in american if i had speech chapter vii four days after these curious incidents a funeral started from canterville chase at about eleven at night the hearse was drawn by eight black horses each of which carried on its head a great tuft of nodding and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich purple pall on which was embroidered in gold the canterville by the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the servants with lighted torches and the whole procession was wonderfully impressive lord canterville was the chief mourner having come up specially from wales to attend the funeral and sat in the first carriage along with little virginia then came the united states minister and his wife then washington and the three boys and in the last carriage was mrs umney it was generally felt that as she had been frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life she had a right to see the last of him a deep grave had been dug in the corner of the churchyard just under the old and the service was read in the most impressive manner by the rev augustus dampier when the ceremony was over the servants according to an old custom observed in the canterville family extinguished their torches and as the coffin was being lowered into the grave virginia stepped forward and laid on it a large cross made of white and pink as she did so the moon came out from behind a cloud and flooded with its silent silver the little churchyard and from a distant copse a nightingale began to sing she thought of the description of the garden of death her eyes became dim with tears and she hardly spoke a word during the drive home the next morning before lord canterville went up to town mr otis had an interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given to virginia they were perfectly magnificent especially a certain ruby necklace with old venetian setting which was really a superb specimen of work and their value was so great that mr otis felt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them my lord he said i know that in this country mortmain is held to apply to trinkets as well as to land and it is quite clear to me that these jewels are or should be heirlooms in your family i must beg you accordingly to take them to london with you and to regard them simply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you under certain strange conditions as for my daughter she is merely a child and has as yet i am glad to say but little interest in such appurtenances of idle luxury i am also informed by mrs otis who i may say is no mean authority upon art having had the privilege of spending several winters in boston when she was a girl that these gems are of great monetary worth and if offered for sale would fetch a tall price under these circumstances lord canterville i feel sure that you will recognise how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain in the possession of any member of my family and indeed all such vain gauds and toys however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the british aristocracy would be completely out of place among those who have been brought up on the severe and i believe immortal principles of republican simplicity perhaps i should mention that virginia is very anxious that you should allow her to retain the box as a memento of your unfortunate but misguided ancestor as it is extremely old and consequently a good deal out of repair you may perhaps think fit to comply with her request for my own part i confess i am a good deal surprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with mediævalism in any form and can only account for it by the fact that virginia was born in one of your london suburbs shortly after mrs otis had returned from a trip to athens lord canterville listened very gravely to the worthy speech pulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile and when mr otis had ended he shook him cordially by the hand and said my dear sir your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky ancestor sir simon a very important service and i and my family are much indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck the jewels are clearly hers and egad i believe that if i were heartless enough to take them from her the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave in a fortnight leading me the devil of a life as for their being heirlooms nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or legal document and the existence of these jewels has been quite unknown i assure you i have no more claim on them than your butler and when miss virginia grows up i daresay she will be pleased to have pretty things to wear besides you forget mr otis that you took the furniture and the ghost at a valuation and anything that belonged to the ghost passed at once into your possession as whatever activity sir simon may have shown in the corridor at night in point of law he was really dead and you acquired his property by purchase the for a long time it had been arranged they all should go to the harvard and yale game in winthrop's car it was perfectly well understood even peabody who pictured himself and miss forbes in the back of the car with her brother and winthrop in front condescended to approve it was necessary to invite peabody because it was his great good fortune to be engaged to miss forbes her brother sam had been invited not only because he could act as chaperon for his sister but because since they were at st paul's winthrop and he either as participants or spectators had never missed going together to the game and beatrice forbes herself had been invited because she was herself when at nine o'clock on the morning of the game winthrop stopped the car in front of her door he was in love with all the world in the november air there was a sting like cider in the sky there was a brilliant beautiful sun in the wind was the tingling touch of three rivers and in the big house facing central park outside of which his prancing steed of brass and scarlet chugged and protested and trembled with impatience was the most wonderful girl in all the world it was true she was engaged to be married and not to him but she was not yet married and it would be his privilege to carry her through the state of new york and the state of connecticut and he would snatch glimpses of her profile rising from the rough fur collar of her hair of the long lovely lashes under the gray veil shall be together breathe and ride so one day more am i deified whispered the young man in the scarlet car who knows but the world may end as he waited at the curb other great of every speed and shape in the mad race for the boston post road and the town of new haven swept up fifth avenue some rolled and puffed like tugboats in a heavy seaway others glided by noiseless and proud as private yachts but each flew the colors of blue or crimson winthrop's car because her brother had gone to one college and he had played right end for the other was draped impartially and so every other car mocked or cheered it and in one a youth stood up and shouted to his fellows look there's billy winthrop three times three for old billy winthrop and they lashed the air with flags and sent his name echoing over central park winthrop grinned in embarrassment and waved his hand a bicycle cop and fred the chauffeur were equally impressed was they the harvoids sir asked fred they was said winthrop her brother sam came down the steps carrying sweaters and but he wore no holiday countenance what do you think he demanded indignantly ernest peabody's inside making trouble his sister has a pullman on one of the special trains and he wants beatrice to go with her in spite of his furs the young man in the car turned quite cold not with us he gasped miss forbes appeared at the house door followed by ernest peabody he wore an expression of disturbed dignity she one of distressed amusement that she also wore her automobile coat caused the heart of winthrop to leap hopefully winthrop said peabody i am in rather an embarrassing position my sister mrs taylor holbrooke he spoke the name as though he were announcing it at the door of a desires miss forbes to go with her she feels accidents are apt to occur with motor cars and there are no other ladies in your party and the crowds winthrop carefully avoided looking at miss forbes i should be very sorry he murmured ernest said miss forbes i explained it was impossible for me to go with your sister we would be extremely rude to mr winthrop how do you wish us to sit she asked she mounted to the rear seat and made room opposite her for peabody do i understand beatrice began peabody in a tone that instantly made every one extremely uncomfortable that i am to tell my sister you are not coming ernest begged miss forbes winthrop bent hastily over the oil valves he read the speedometer which was as usual out of order with fascinated interest ernest pleaded miss forbes mr winthrop and sam planned this trip for us a long time ago to give us a little pleasure then said peabody in a hollow voice you have decided ernest cried miss forbes don't look at me as though you meant to hurl the curse of rome i have jump in please i will bid you said peabody i have only just time to catch our train miss forbes rose and moved to the door of the car i had better not go with any one she said in a low voice you will go with me commanded her brother come on ernest thank you no replied peabody i have promised my sister all right then exclaimed sam briskly see you at the game section h don't forget let her out billy with a troubled countenance winthrop bent forward and clasped the clutch a gilded opportunity although the whole fabric of rena's new life toppled and fell with her lover's defection her sympathies broadened by culture and still more by her recent emotional experience did not shrink as would have been the case with a more selfish soul to the mere limits of her personal sorrow great as this seemed at the moment she had learned to love and when the love of one man failed her she turned to humanity as a stream obstructed in its course overflows the adjacent country her early training had not directed her thoughts to the darker people with whose fate her own was bound up so closely but rather away from them she had been taught to despise them because they were not so white as she was and had been slaves while she was free her life in her brother's home by removing her from immediate contact with them had given her a different point of view one which emphasized their shortcomings and thereby made vastly clearer to her the gulf that separated them from the new world in which she lived so that when misfortune threw her back upon them the reaction brought her nearer than before where once she had seemed able to escape from them they were now it appeared her inalienable race thus doubly equipped she was able to view them at once with the mental eye of an outsider and the sympathy of a sister she could see their faults and judge them charitably she knew and appreciated their good qualities with her quickened intelligence she could perceive how great was their need and how small their opportunity and with this illumination came the desire to contribute to their help she had not the breadth or culture to see in all its ramifications the great problem which still puzzles statesmen and philosophers but she was conscious of the wish and of the power in a small way to do something for the advancement of those who had just set their feet upon the ladder of progress this desire to be of service to her rediscovered people was not long without an opportunity for expression yet the fates willed that her future should be but another link in a connected chain she was to be as powerless to put aside her recent past as she had been to escape from the influence of her earlier life there are sordid souls that eat and drink and breed and die and imagine they have lived but rena's life since her great awakening had been that of the emotions and her temperament made of it a continuous life her successive states of consciousness were not detachable but united to form a single if not an entirely harmonious whole to her sensitive spirit was born of yesterday would be but the offspring of to day one day along toward noon her mother received a visit from mary b pettifoot a second cousin who lived on back street only a short distance from the house behind the cedars rena had gone out so that the visitor found mis molly alone i heared you say cousin molly said mary b no one ever knew what the b in mary's name stood for it was a mere ornamental flourish that rena was talkin bout teachin school i've got a good chance fer her ef she keers ter take it my cousin jeff wain rived in town this mo'nin f'm way down in sampson county ter git a teacher fer the nigger school in his deestric i s'pose he mought a got one f'm roun newbern er goldsboro er some er them places eas but he lowed he'd like to visit some er his kin an ole frien's an so kill two birds with one stone i seed

lots er hosses an mules an cows an hawgs he raise fifty bales er cotton las year an he's be'n ter the legislatur my gracious exclaimed mis molly struck with awe at this catalogue of the stranger's possessions he was evidently worth more than a great many rich white people all white people in north carolina in those days were either rich or poor the distinction being one of caste rather than of wealth is he married she inquired with interest no single you mought low it was quare that he should n be married at his age but he was crossed in love oncet mary b heaved a sigh an has stayed single ever sence that wuz ten years ago but as some husban's is an there ain no mo chance fer im now than there wuz then i reckon some nice gal mought stan a good show er ketchin im ef she'd play her kyards right chapter viii on a certain afternoon in the early part of july about a month after the fight at the irrigating ditch and the mass meeting at bonneville cedarquist at the moment opening his mail in his office in san francisco was genuinely surprised to receive a visit from presley well upon my word pres exclaimed the manufacturer as the young man came in through the door that the office boy held open for him upon my word have you been sick sit down my boy have a glass of sherry i always keep a bottle here presley accepted the wine and sank into the depths of a great leather chair near by sick he answered yes i have been sick i'm sick now i'm gone to pieces sir his manner was the extreme of listlessness the listlessness of great fatigue well well observed the other i'm right sorry to hear that what's the trouble pres oh nerves mostly i suppose and my head and insomnia and weakness a general collapse all along the line the doctor tells me he says i fancy i rather narrowly missed brain fever well i can easily suppose it answered cedarquist gravely after all you have been through presley closed his eyes they were sunken in circles of dark brown flesh and pressed a thin hand to the back of his head it is a nightmare he murmured a frightful nightmare and it's not over yet you have heard of it all only through the newspaper reports but down there at bonneville at los muertos oh you can have no idea of it of the misery caused by the defeat of the ranchers and by this decision of the supreme court that dispossesses them all we had gone on hoping to the last that we would win there we had thought that in the supreme court of the united states at least we could find justice and the news of its decision was the worst last blow of all for magnus it was the last positively the very last poor poor derrick murmured cedarquist tell me about him pres how does he take it what is he going to do it beggars him sir he sunk a great deal more than any of us believed in his ranch when he resolved to turn off most of the tenants and farm the ranch himself then the fight he made against the railroad in the courts and the political campaign he went into to get lyman on the railroad commission took more of it the money that genslinger blackmailed him of it seems was about all he had left he had been gambling you know the governor on another bonanza crop this year to recoup him well the bonanza came right enough just in time for s behrman and the railroad to grab it magnus is ruined what a tragedy what a tragedy murmured the other lyman turning rascal harran killed and now this and all within so short a time all at the same time you might almost say if it had only killed him continued presley but that is the worst of it how the worst i'm afraid honestly i'm afraid it is going to turn his wits sir it's broken him oh you should see him you should see him a shambling stooping trembling old man in his dotage already he sits all day in the turning over papers sorting them tying them up opening them again forgetting them all fumbling and mumbling and confused and at table sometimes he forgets to eat and listen you know from the house we can hear the trains whistling for the long trestle as often as that happens the governor seems to be oh i don't know frightened he will sink his head between his shoulders as though he were dodging something and he won't fetch a long breath again till the train is out of hearing he seems to have conceived an abject unreasoned terror of the railroad but he will have to leave los muertos now of course yes they will all have to leave they have a fortnight more the few tenants that were still on los muertos are leaving that is one thing that brings me to the city the family of one of the men who was killed hooven was his name have come to the city to find work i think they are liable to be in great distress unless they have been wonderfully lucky and i am trying to find them in order to look after them you need looking after yourself pres oh once away from bonneville and the sight of the ruin there i'm better but i intend to go away and that makes me think i came to ask you if you could help me if you would let me take passage on one of your wheat ships the doctor says an ocean voyage would set me up why certainly pres declared cedarquist but i'm sorry you'll have to go we expected to have you down in the country with us this winter presley shook his head no he answered i must go even if i had all my health i could not bring myself to stay in california just now if you can introduce me to one of your captains ix what a sparrow saw ever since the eventful morning when carl had neglected the big gray for a stolen hour with jennie cully had busied himself in devising ways of making the swede's life miserable with a boy's keen insight he had discovered enough to convince him that carl was dead mashed on jennie as he put it but whether for keeps or not he had not yet determined he had already enriched his songs with certain tender allusions to their present frame of mind and their future state of happiness where was moses when the light went out and little annie rooney had undergone so subtle a change when sung at the top of mr james finnegan's voice that while the original warp and woof of those very popular melodies were entirely unrecognizable to any but the persons interested to them they were as gall and wormwood this was cully's invariable way of expressing his opinions on current affairs he would sit on the of his cart the big gray stumbling over the stones as he walked the reins lying loose and fill the air with details of events passing in the village with all the gusto of a variety actor the impending strike at the brewery had been made the basis of a paraphrase of johnnie get your gun and even mcgaw's red head had come in for its share of abuse to the air of fire boys fire so for a time this new development of tenderness on the part of carl for jennie served to ring the changes on moses and annie rooney carl's budding hopes had been slightly nipped by the cold look in tom's eye when she asked him if it took an hour to give jennie a tattered apron with some disappointment he noticed that except at rare intervals and only when tom was at home he was no longer invited to the house he had always been a timid shrinking fellow where a woman was concerned having followed the sea and lived among men since he was sixteen years old during these earlier years he had made two voyages in the pacific and another to the in the arctic seas on this last voyage in a gale of wind he had saved all the lives aboard a brig the crew helpless from scurvy when the lifeboat reached the lee of her stern carl at the risk of his life climbed aboard caught a line and lowered the men one by one into the rescuing yawl he could with perfect equanimity have faced another storm and rescued a second crew any hour of the day or night but he could not face a woman's displeasure moreover what tom wanted done was law to carl she had taken him out of the streets and given him a home he would serve her in whatever way she wished as long as he lived he and gran'pop were fast friends on rainy days or when work was dull in the winter months the old man would often come into carl's little chamber next the in the stable and sit on his bed by the hour and carl would tell him about his people at home and show him the pictures tacked over his bed those of his old mother with her white cap and of the young sister who was soon to be married on sundays carl followed tom and her family to church waiting until they had left the house he always sat far back near the door so that he could see them come out then he would overtake pop with patsy whenever the little fellow could go this was not often for now there were many days when the boy had to lie all day on the lounge in the poring over his books or playing with stumpy brought into the kitchen to amuse him since the day of tom's warning look carl rarely joined her daughter jennie would loiter by the way speaking to the girls but he would hang back he felt that tom did not want them together one spring morning however a new complication arose it was a morning when the sky was a delicate when the sunlight came tempered through a tender land haze and a filmy mist from the still sea when all the air was redolent with sweet smells of coming spring and all the girls were gay in new attire dennis quigg had been lounging outside the church door his silk hat and green satin necktie glistening in the sun when jennie tripped out quigg started forward the look on his face as with swinging shoulders he slouched beside her sent a thrill of indignation through carl he could give her up perhaps if tom insisted but never to a man like quigg before the walking delegate had passed the time of day the young sailor was close beside jennie within touch of her hand there was no love lost between the two men carl had not forgotten the proposition quigg had made to him to leave tom's employ nor had quigg forgotten the uplifted shovel with which his proposal had been greeted yet there was no jealousy between them mr walking delegate dennis quigg confidential agent of branch no knights of labor had too good an opinion of himself ever to look upon that duffer of a in the light of a rival nor could carl for a moment think of that flashily dressed knight as being able to make the slightest impression on mees jan the rube it was the most critical time i had yet experienced in my career as a baseball manager and there was more than the usual reason why i must pull the team out a chance for a business deal depended upon the of the stockholders of the worcester club on the outskirts of the town was a little cottage that i wanted to buy and this depended upon the business deal my whole future happiness depended upon the little girl i hoped to install in that cottage coming to the worcester eastern league team i had found a strong aggregation and an enthusiastic following i really had a team with pennant possibilities providence was a strong rival but i beat them three straight in the opening series set a fast pace and likewise set worcester baseball mad the eastern league clubs were pretty evenly matched still i continued to hold the lead until misfortune overtook me gregg smashed an umpire and had to be laid off mullaney got spiked while sliding and was out of the game ashwell sprained his ankle and hirsch broke a finger radbourne my great pitcher hurt his arm on a cold day and he could not get up his old speed stringer who had batted three hundred and and led the league the year before struck a bad spell and could not hit a barn door handed up to him then came the slump the team suddenly let down went to pieces played ball that would have disgraced an amateur nine it was a trying time here was a great team strong everywhere a little hard luck had dug up a slump and now day by day the team dropped in the race when we reached the second division the newspapers flayed us worcester would never stand for a second division team baseball admirers reporters fans especially the fans are fickle the admirers quit the reporters grilled us and the fans though they stuck to the games with that tenacity peculiar to them made life miserable for all of us i saw the pennant slowly fading and the successful season and the business deal and the cottage and milly but when i thought of her i just could not see failure something must be done but what i was at the end of my wits when jersey city beat us that saturday eleven to two shoving us down to fifth place with only a few percentage points above the fall river team i grew desperate and locking my players in the dressing room i went after them they had lain down on me and needed a jar i told them so straight and flat and being bitter i did not pick and choose my words and fellows i concluded you've got to brace a little more of this and we can't pull out i tell you you're a championship team we had that pennant cinched a few cuts and sprains and hard luck and you all quit you lay down i've been patient i've plugged for you never a man have i fined or thrown down but now i'm at the end of my string i'm out to fine you now and i'll release the first man who shows the least yellow i play no more substitutes crippled or not you guys have got to get in the game i waited to catch my breath and expected some such outburst as managers usually get from criticized players but not a word then i addressed some of them personally gregg your ends today you play monday mullaney you've drawn your salary for two weeks with that spiked foot if you can't run on it well all right but i put it up to your good faith i've played the game and i know it's hard to run on a sore foot but you can do it ashwell your ankle is lame i know now can you run sure i can i'm not a quitter i'm ready to go in replied ashwell raddy how about you i said turning to my star twirler connelly i've seen as fast a team in as bad a rut and yet pull out returned radbourne we're about due for the brace when it comes look out as for me well my arm isn't right but it's acting these warm days in a way that tells me it will be soon it's been worked too hard can't you get another pitcher i'm not knocking herne or cairns they're good for their turn but we need a new man to help out and he must be a crackerjack if we're to get back to the lead where on earth can i find such a pitcher i shouted almost distracted well that's up to you replied radbourne up to me it certainly was and i cudgeled my brains for inspiration after i had given up in hopelessness it came in the shape of a notice i read in one of the papers it was a brief mention of an amateur worcester ball team being shut out in a game with a rickettsville nine rickettsville played sunday ball which gave me an opportunity to look them over it took some train riding and then a journey by coach to get to rickettsville i mingled with the crowd of talking rustics there was only one little bleachers and this was loaded to the danger point with the feminine adherents of the teams most of the crowd centered alongside and back of the catcher's box i edged in and got a position just behind the stone that served as home plate chapter vi madame la vicomtesse hesitating on the step a lady stood in the doorway a study in black and white in a frame of pink roses the sash at her waist the lace mantilla that clung about her throat the deftly coiled hair with its sheen of the night waters these in black the simple gown a tribute to the art of her countrywomen in white mrs temple had gone forward to meet her but i stood staring marvelling forgetful in the path they were talking they were coming towards me and i heard mrs temple pronounce my name and hers madame de montméry i bowed she courtesied there was a baffling light in the brown eyes when i dared to glance at them and a smile playing around her mouth was there no word in the two languages to find its way to my lips mrs temple laid her hand on my arm david is not what one might call a ladies man madame she said the lady laughed he she said i am sure you will frighten him with your wit answered mrs temple smiling he is worth sparing he is worth frightening then said the lady in exquisite english and she looked at me again you and david should like each other said mrs temple you are both capable persons friends of the friendless and towers of strength to the weak the face became serious but still there was the expression i could not make out in an instant she seemed to have scrutinized me with a precision from which there could be no appeal i seem to know mr ritchie she said and added quickly mrs clive has talked a great deal about you she has made you out a very wonderful person my dear said mrs temple the wonderful people of this world are those who find time to comfort and help the unfortunate that is why you and david are wonderful no one knows better than i how easy it is to be selfish i have brought you an english novel said madame de montoméry turning abruptly to mrs temple but you must not read it at night lindy is not to let you have it until there said mrs temple gayly to me madame is not happy unless she is controlling some one and i am a rebellious subject you have not been taking care of yourself said madame she glanced at me and bit her lips as though guessing the emotion which my visit had caused listen she said the vesper bells you must go into the house and mr ritchie and i must leave you she took mrs temple by the arm and led her unresisting along the path i followed a thousand thoughts and conjectures spinning in my brain they reached the bench under the little tree beside the door and stood talking for a moment of the routine of mrs life madame it seemed had prescribed a regimen and meant to have it followed suddenly i saw mrs temple take the arm and sink down upon the bench then we were both beside her bending over her she sitting upright and smiling at us it is nothing she said i am so easily tired her lips were ashen and her breath came quickly madame acted with that instant promptness which i expected of her you must carry her in mr ritchie she said quietly no it is only momentary david said mrs temple i remember how pitifully frail and light she was as i picked her up and followed madame through the doorway into the little bedroom i laid mrs temple on the bed send lindy here said madame lindy was in the front room with the negress whom madame had brought with her they were not talking i supposed then this was because lindy did not speak french i did not know that madame de maid was a mute both of them went into the bedroom and i was left alone the door and windows were closed and a green candle was burning on the table i looked about me with astonishment but for the low ceiling and the wide cypress puncheons of the floor the room might have been a budoir in a on the polished mahogany table lay books in tasteful bindings a bookcase stood in the corner a fauteuil and various other chairs which might have come from the hands of an adam were ranged about tall silver candlesticks graced each end of the little and between them were two lowestoft vases having the temple coat of arms it might have been half an hour that i waited now pacing the floor now throwing myself into the by the fireplace anxiety for mrs temple problems that lost themselves in a dozen conjectures all idle these agitated me almost beyond my power of once i felt for the miniature took it out and put it back without looking at it at last i was startled to my feet by the opening of the door and madame de montméry came in she closed the door softly behind her with the deft quickness and decision of movement which a sixth sense had told me she possessed crossed the room swiftly and stood confronting me the eye of apollo that singular smoky sparkle at once a confusion and a transparency which is the strange secret of the thames was changing more and more from its grey to its glittering extreme as the sun climbed to the zenith over westminster and two men crossed westminster bridge one man was very tall and the other very short they might even have been fantastically compared to the arrogant of parliament and the humbler humped shoulders of the abbey for the short man was in clerical dress the official description of the tall man was m hercule flambeau private detective and he was going to his new offices in a new pile of flats facing the abbey entrance the official description of the short man was the reverend j brown attached to st francis church camberwell and he was coming from a camberwell deathbed to see the new offices of his friend the building was american in its altitude and american also in the oiled elaboration of its machinery of telephones and lifts but it was barely finished and still understaffed only three tenants had moved in the office just above flambeau was occupied as also was the office just below him the two floors above that and the three floors below were entirely bare but the first glance at the new tower of flats caught something much more arresting save for a few relics of scaffolding the one glaring object was erected outside the office just above it was an enormous gilt effigy of the human eye surrounded with rays of gold and taking up as much room as two or three of the office windows what on earth is that asked father brown and stood still oh a new religion said flambeau laughing one of those new religions that forgive your sins by saying you never had any rather like christian science i should think the fact is that a fellow calling himself kalon i know what his name is except that it be that has taken the flat just above me i have two lady typewriters underneath me and this enthusiastic old humbug on top he calls himself the new priest of apollo and he worships the sun let him look out said father brown the sun was the cruellest of all the gods but what does that monstrous eye mean as i understand it it is a theory of theirs answered flambeau that a man can endure anything if his mind is quite steady their two great symbols are the sun and the open eye for they say that if a man were really healthy he could stare at the sun if a man were really healthy said father brown he would not bother to stare at it well all i can tell you about the new religion went on flambeau carelessly it claims of course that it can cure all physical diseases can it cure the one spiritual disease asked father brown with a serious curiosity and what is the one spiritual disease asked flambeau smiling oh thinking one is quite well said his friend flambeau was more interested in the quiet little office below him than in the flamboyant temple above he was a lucid southerner incapable of conceiving himself as anything but a catholic or an atheist and new religions of a bright and pallid sort were not much in his line but humanity was always in his line especially when it was moreover the ladies downstairs were characters in their way the office was kept by two sisters both slight and dark one of them tall and striking she had a dark eager and aquiline profile and was one of those women whom one always thinks of in profile as of the edge of some weapon she seemed to cleave her way through life she had eyes of startling brilliancy but it was the brilliancy of steel rather than of diamonds and her straight slim figure was a shade too stiff for its grace her younger sister was like her shortened shadow a little greyer paler and more insignificant they both wore a black with little masculine cuffs and collars there are thousands of such curt strenuous ladies in the offices of london but the interest of these lay rather in their real than their apparent position for pauline stacey the elder was actually the heiress of a crest and half a county as well as great wealth she had been brought up in castles and gardens before a frigid fierceness peculiar to the modern woman had driven her to what she considered a harsher and a higher existence she had not indeed surrendered her money in that there would have been a romantic or monkish abandon quite alien to her masterful utilitarianism she held her wealth she would say for use upon practical social objects part of it she had put into her business the nucleus of a model typewriting emporium part of it was distributed in various leagues and causes for the advancement of such work among women how far joan her sister and partner shared this slightly prosaic idealism no one could be very sure but she followed her leader with a affection which was somehow more attractive with its touch of tragedy than the hard high spirits of the elder for pauline stacey had nothing to say to tragedy she was understood to deny its existence chapter xi faith and unfaith at jane withersteen's home the promise made to mrs larkin to care for little fay had begun to be fulfilled like a gleam of sunlight through the cottonwoods was the coming of the child to the gloomy house of withersteen the big silent halls echoed with childish laughter in the shady court where jane spent many of the hot july days fay's tiny feet pattered over the stone flags and splashed in the amber stream she prattled incessantly what difference jane thought a child made in her home it had never been a real home she discovered even the tidiness and neatness she had so observed and upon which she had insisted to her women became in the light of fay's smile habits that now lost their importance fay littered the court with jane's books and papers and other toys her fancy improvised and many a strange craft went floating down the little brook and it was owing to fay's presence that jane withersteen came to see more of lassiter the rider had for the most part kept to the sage he rode for her but he did not seek her except on business and jane had to acknowledge in pique that her overtures had been made in vain fay however captured lassiter the moment he first laid eyes on her jane was present at the meeting and there was something about it which dimmed her sight and softened her toward this foe of her people the rider had clanked into the court a tired yet wary man always looking for the attack upon him that was inevitable and might come from any quarter and he had walked right upon little fay the child had been beautiful even in her rags and amid the surroundings of the hovel in the sage but now in a pretty white dress with her shining curls brushed and her face clean and rosy she was lovely she left her play and looked up at lassiter if there was not an instinct for all three of them in that meeting an unreasoning tendency toward a closer intimacy then jane withersteen believed she had been subject to a queer fancy she imagined any child would have feared lassiter and fay larkin had been a lonely a solitary elf of the sage not at all an ordinary child and exquisitely shy with strangers she watched lassiter with great round grave eyes but showed no fear the rider gave jane a favorable report of cattle and horses and as he took the seat to which she invited him little fay edged as much as half an inch nearer jane replied to his look of inquiry and told fay's story the rider's gray earnest gaze troubled her then he turned to fay and smiled in a way that made jane doubt her sense of the true relation of things how could lassiter smile so at a child when he had made so many children fatherless but he did smile and to the gentleness she had seen a few times he added something that was infinitely sad and sweet jane's intuition told her that lassiter had never been a father but if life ever so blessed him he would be a good one fay also must have found that smile singularly winning for she edged closer and closer and then by way of feminine capitulation went to jane from whose side she bent a beautiful glance upon the rider lassiter only smiled at her jane watched them and realized that now was the moment she should seize if she was ever to win this man from his hatred but the step was not easy to take the more she saw of lassiter the more she respected him and the greater her respect the harder it became to lend herself to mere coquetry yet as she thought of her great motive of tull and of that other whose name she had schooled herself never to think of in connection with milly erne's avenger she suddenly found she had no choice and her creed gave her boldness far beyond the limit to which vanity would have led her lassiter i see so little of you now she said and was conscious of heat in her cheeks i've been riding hard he replied but you can't live in the saddle you come in sometimes won't you come here to see me oftener is that an order nonsense i simply ask you to come to see me when you find time why the query once heard was not so embarrassing to jane as she might have imagined moreover it established in her mind a fact that there existed actually other than selfish reasons for her wanting to see him and as she had been bold so she determined to be both honest and brave i've reasons only one of which i need mention she answered if it's possible i want to change you toward my people and on the moment i can conceive of little i wouldn't do to gain that end how much better and freer jane felt after that confession she meant to show him that there was one mormon who could play a game or wage a fight in the open preface nothing is more easy than to state the subject of the ambassadors which first appeared in twelve numbers of the north american review and was published as a whole the same year the situation involved is gathered up betimes that is in the second chapter of book fifth for the benefit into as few words as possible planted or sunk stiffly and saliently in the centre of the current almost perhaps to the obstruction of traffic never can a composition of this sort have sprung straighter from a dropped grain of suggestion and never can that grain developed overgrown and smothered have yet lurked more in the mass as an independent particle the whole case in fine is in lambert irrepressible outbreak to little bilham on the sunday afternoon in garden the candour with which he yields for his young enlightenment to the charming admonition of that crisis the idea of the tale resides indeed in the very fact that an hour of such unprecedented ease should have been felt by him as a crisis and he is at pains to express it for us as neatly as we could desire the remarks to which he thus gives utterance contain the essence of the ambassadors his fingers close before he has done round the stem of the flower which after that fashion he continues officiously to present to us live all you can a mistake not to it so much matter what you do in particular so long as you have your life if you had that what have you had too old too old at any rate for what i see what one loses one loses make no mistake about that still we have the illusion of freedom therefore like me be without the memory of that illusion i was either at the right time too stupid or too intelligent to have it and now a case of reaction against the mistake do what you like so long as you make it for it was a mistake live live such is the gist of appeal to the impressed youth whom he likes and whom he desires to befriend the word mistake occurs several times it will be seen in the course of his remarks which gives the measure of the signal warning he feels attached to his case he has accordingly missed too much though perhaps after all constitutionally qualified for a better part and he wakes up to it in conditions that press the spring of a terrible question would there yet perhaps be time for reparation reparation that is for the injury done his character for the affront he is quite ready to say so stupidly put upon it and in which he has even himself had so clumsy a hand the answer to which is that he now at all events sees so that the business of my tale and the march of my action not to say the precious moral of everything is just my demonstration of this process of vision nothing can exceed the closeness with which the whole fits again into its germ that had been given me bodily as usual by the spoken word for i was to take the image over exactly as i happened to have met it a friend had repeated to me with great appreciation a thing or two said to him by a man of distinction much his senior and to which a sense akin to that of melancholy eloquence might be imputed said as chance would have and so easily might in paris and in a charming old garden attached to a house of art and on a sunday afternoon of summer many persons of great interest being present the observation there listened to and gathered up had contained part of the note that i was to recognise on the spot as to my purpose had contained in fact the greater part the rest was in the place and the time and the scene they sketched these constituents clustered and combined to give me further support to give me what i may call the note absolute there it stands accordingly full in the tideway driven in with hard taps like some strong stake for the noose of a cable the swirl of the current roundabout it what amplified the hint to more than the bulk of hints in general was the gift with it of the old paris garden for in that token were sealed up values infinitely precious there was of course the seal to break and each item of the packet to count over and handle and estimate but somehow in the light of the hint all the elements of a situation of the sort most to my taste were there i could even remember no occasion on which so confronted i had found it of a livelier interest to take stock in this fashion of suggested wealth for i think verily that there are degrees of merit in subjects in spite of the fact that to treat even one of the most ambiguous with due decency we must for the time for the feverish and prejudiced hour at least figure its merit and its dignity as possibly absolute what it comes to doubtless is that even among the supremely good since with such alone is it theory of honour to be concerned there is an ideal beauty of goodness the invoked action of which is to raise the artistic faith to its maximum then truly i hold theme may be said to shine and that of the ambassadors i confess wore this glow for me from beginning to end fortunately thus i am able to estimate this as frankly quite the best all round of all my productions any failure of that justification would have made such an extreme of complacency publicly fatuous january a happy new year to you all my dearest family which of course includes mr l and a young man by the name of teddy i can't tell you how much i enjoyed your christmas bundle for i didn't get it till night and had given up hoping your letter came in the morning but you said nothing about a parcel meaning it for a surprise so i was disappointed for i'd had a kind of feeling that you wouldn't forget me i felt a little low in my mind as i sat up in my room after tea and when the big muddy bundle was brought to me i just hugged it and pranced it was so homey and refreshing that i sat down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried in my usual absurd way the things were just what i wanted and all the better for being made instead of bought beth's new ink bib was capital and hannah's box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure i'll be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent marmee and read carefully the books father has marked thank you all heaps and heaps speaking of books reminds me that i'm getting rich in that line for on new year's day mr bhaer gave me a fine shakespeare it is one he values much and i've often admired it set up in the place of honor with his german bible plato homer and milton so you may imagine how i felt when he brought it down without its cover and showed me my own name in it from my friend friedrich bhaer you say often you wish a library here i gif you one for between these lids he meant covers is many books in one read him well and he will help you much for the study of character in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen i thanked him as well as i could and talk now about my library as if i had a hundred books i never knew how much there was in shakespeare before but then i never had a bhaer to explain it to me now don't laugh at his horrid name it isn't pronounced either bear or beer as people will say it but something between the two as only germans can give it i'm glad you both like what i tell you about him and hope you will know him some day mother would admire his warm heart father his wise head i admire both and feel rich in my new friend friedrich bhaer not having much money or knowing what he'd like i got several little things and put them about the room where he would find them unexpectedly they were useful pretty or funny a new standish on his table a little vase for his flower he always has one or a bit of green in a glass to keep him fresh he says and a holder for his blower so that he needn't burn up what amy calls mouchoirs i made it like those beth invented a big butterfly with a fat body and black and yellow wings worsted feelers and bead eyes it took his fancy immensely and he put it on his mantlepiece as an article of virtue so it was rather a failure after all poor as he is he didn't forget a servant or a child in the house and not a soul here from the french laundrywoman to miss norton forgot him i was so glad of that they got up a masquerade and had a gay time new year's eve i didn't mean to go down having no dress but at the last minute mrs kirke remembered some old brocades and miss norton lent me lace and feathers so i dressed up as mrs malaprop and sailed in with a mask on no one knew me for i disguised my voice and no one dreamed of the silent haughty miss march for they think i am very stiff and cool most of them and so i am to whippersnappers could dance and dress and burst out into a nice derangement of epitaphs like an allegory on the banks of the nile i enjoyed it very much and when we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me i heard one of the young men tell another that he knew i'd been an actress in fact he thought he remembered seeing me at one of the minor theaters meg will relish that joke mr bhaer was nick bottom and tina was titania a perfect little fairy in his arms to see them dance was quite a landscape to use a teddyism i had a very happy new year after all and when i thought it over in my room i felt as if i was getting on a little in spite of my many failures for i'm cheerful all the time now work with a will and take more interest in other people than i used to which is satisfactory bless you all ever your loving jo the halt on the turnpike road down downward they went and yet further down their descent at each step seeming to outmeasure their advance their skirts were scratched noisily by the furze their shoulders brushed by the ferns which though dead and dry stood erect as when alive no sufficient winter weather having as yet arrived to beat them down their tartarean situation might by some have been called an imprudent one for two unattended women but these shaggy recesses were at all seasons a familiar surrounding to olly and mrs yeobright and the addition of darkness lends no frightfulness to the face of a friend and so tamsin has married him at last said olly when the incline had become so much less steep that their no longer required undivided attention mrs yeobright answered slowly yes at last how you will miss her living with ee as a daughter as she always have i do miss her olly though without the tact to perceive when remarks were untimely was saved by her very simplicity from rendering them offensive questions that would have been resented in others she could ask with impunity this accounted for mrs yeobright's acquiescence in the revival of an evidently sore subject i was quite strook to hear you'd agreed to it ma'am that i was continued the you were not more struck by it than i should have been last year this time olly there are a good many sides to that wedding i could not tell you all of them even if i tried i felt myself that he was hardly enough to mate with your family keeping an inn what is it but a's clever that's true and they say he was an engineering gentleman once but has come down by being too outwardly given i saw that upon the whole it would be better she should marry where she wished poor little thing her feelings got the better of her no doubt tis nature well they may call him what they will he've several acres of broke up here besides the public house and the and his manners be quite like a gentleman's and what's done cannot be undone it cannot said mrs yeobright see here's the at last now we shall get along better the wedding subject was no further dwelt upon and soon a faint diverging path was reached where they parted company olly first begging her companion to remind mr wildeve that he had not sent her sick husband the bottle of wine promised on the occasion of his marriage the turned to the left towards her own house behind a spur of the hill and mrs yeobright followed the straight track which further on joined the highway by the quiet woman inn whither she supposed her niece to have returned with wildeve from their wedding at anglebury that day she first reached wildeve's patch as it was called a plot of land redeemed from the heath and after long and laborious years brought into cultivation the man who had discovered that it could be tilled died of the labour the man who succeeded him in possession ruined himself in fertilizing it wildeve came like amerigo vespucci and received the honours due to those who had gone before when mrs yeobright had drawn near to the inn and was about to enter she saw a horse and vehicle some two hundred yards beyond it coming towards her a man walking alongside with a lantern in his hand it was soon evident that this was the reddleman who had inquired for her instead of entering the inn at once she walked by it and towards the van the conveyance came close and the man was about to pass her with little notice when she turned to him and said i think you have been inquiring for me i am mrs yeobright of the reddleman started and held up his finger he stopped the horses and beckoned to her to withdraw with him a few yards aside which she did wondering you don't know me ma'am i suppose he said i do not said she why yes i do you are young venn your father was a dairyman somewhere here yes and i knew your niece miss tamsin a little i have something bad to tell you about her no she has just come home i believe with her husband they arranged to return this afternoon to the inn beyond here she's not there how do you know because she's here she's in my van he added slowly what new trouble has come murmured mrs yeobright putting her hand over her eyes i can't explain much ma'am all i know is that as i was going along the road this morning about a mile out of anglebury i heard something trotting after me like a doe and looking round there she was white as death itself oh diggory venn she said i thought twas you will you help me i am in trouble how did she know your christian name said mrs yeobright doubtingly i had met her as a lad before i went away in this trade she asked then if she might ride and then down she fell in a faint i picked her up and put her in and there she has been ever since she has cried a good deal but she has hardly spoke all she has told me being that she was to have been married this morning i tried to get her to eat something but she couldn't and at last she fell asleep iv though the town seemed to carol to change no more than the surrounding fields there was a constant shifting these three years the citizen of the prairie drifts always westward it may be because he is the heir of ancient migrations and it may be because he finds within his own spirit so little adventure that he is driven to seek it by changing his horizon the towns remain unvaried yet the individual faces alter like classes in college the gopher prairie jeweler sells out for no discernible reason and moves on to alberta or the state of washington to open a shop precisely like his former one in a town precisely like the one he has left there is except among professional men and the wealthy small permanence either of residence or occupation a man becomes farmer grocer town policeman garageman postmaster and farmer all over again and the community more or less patiently suffers from his lack of knowledge in each of his experiments ole jenson the grocer and dahl the butcher moved on to south dakota and idaho luke and mrs dawson picked up ten thousand acres of prairie soil in the magic portable form of a small check book and went to pasadena to a bungalow and sunshine and cafeterias chet dashaway sold his furniture and undertaking business and wandered to los angeles where the dauntless reported our good friend chester has accepted a fine position with a firm and his wife has in the charming social circles of the queen city of the southwestland that same popularity which she enjoyed in our own society sets rita simons was married to terry gould and rivaled juanita haydock as the gayest of the young married set but juanita also acquired merit harry's father died harry became senior partner in the bon ton store and juanita was more acidulous and shrewd and cackling than ever she bought an evening frock and exposed her to the wonder of the jolly seventeen and talked of moving to minneapolis to defend her position against the new mrs terry gould she sought to attach carol to her faction by giggling that some folks might call rita innocent but i've got a hunch that she isn't half as ignorant of things as brides are supposed to be and of course terry isn't as a doctor alongside of your husband carol herself would gladly have followed mr ole jenson and migrated even to another main street flight from familiar tedium to new tedium would have for a time the outer look and promise of adventure she hinted to kennicott of the probable medical advantages of montana and oregon she knew that he was satisfied with gopher prairie but it gave her vicarious hope to think of going to ask for railroad folders at the station to trace the maps with a restless forefinger yet to the casual eye she was not discontented she was not an abnormal and distressing traitor to the faith of main street the settled citizen believes that the rebel is constantly in a stew of complaining and hearing of a carol kennicott he gasps what an awful person she must be a holy terror to live with glad my folks are satisfied with things way they are actually it was not so much as five minutes a day that carol devoted to lonely desires it is probable that the agitated citizen has within his circle at least one inarticulate rebel with aspirations as wayward as carol's the presence of the baby had made her take gopher prairie and the brown house seriously as natural places of residence she pleased kennicott by being friendly with the complacent maturity of mrs clark and mrs elder and when she had often enough been in conference upon the elders new cadillac car or the job which the oldest clark boy had taken in the office of the these topics became important things to follow up day by day with of her emotion concentrated upon hugh she did not criticize shops streets acquaintances this year or two she hurried to uncle whittier's store for a package of she abstractedly listened to uncle whittier's denunciation of martin mahoney for asserting that the wind last tuesday had been south and not southwest she came back along streets that held no surprises nor the startling faces of strangers thinking of hugh's teething all the way she did not reflect that this store these drab blocks made up all her background she did her work and she triumphed over winning from the clarks at five hundred the most considerable event of the two years after the birth of hugh occurred when vida sherwin resigned from the high school and was married carol was her attendant and as the wedding was at the episcopal church all the women wore new kid slippers and long white kid gloves and looked refined for years carol had been little sister to vida and had never in the least known to what degree vida loved her and hated her and in curious strained ways was bound to her chapter xxi i gray steel that seems unmoving because it spins so fast in the balanced gray snow in an avenue of elms gray dawn with the sun behind it this was the gray of vida sherwin's life at the burglars it was much too fine a night to think of going to bed at once and so although the witching hour of nine had struck edward and i were still leaning out of the open window in our nightshirts watching the play of the shadows on the moonlit lawn and planning schemes of fresh devilry for the sunshiny morrow from below strains of the jocund piano declared that the olympians were enjoying themselves in their listless impotent way for the new curate had been bidden to dinner that night and was at the moment unclerically proclaiming to all the world that he feared no foe his discordant vociferations doubtless started a train of thought in edward's mind for the youth presently remarked a propos of nothing that had been said before i believe the new curate's rather gone on aunt maria i scouted the notion why she's quite old i said she must have seen some summers of course she is replied edward scornfully it's not her it's her money he's after you bet didn't know she had any money i observed timidly sure to have said my brother with confidence heaps and heaps silence ensued both our minds being busy with the new situation thus presented mine in wonderment at this flaw that so often declared itself in enviable natures of fullest endowment in a man and a good cricketer for instance even as this curate edward's apparently in the consideration of how such a state of things supposing it existed could be best turned to his own advantage bobby ferris told me began edward in due course that there was a fellow spooning his sister once what's spooning i asked meekly oh i dunno said edward indifferently it's it's it's just a thing they do you know and he used to carry notes and messages and things between em and he got a shilling almost every time what from each of em i innocently inquired edward looked at me with scornful pity girls never have any money he briefly explained but she did his exercises and got him out of rows and told stories for him when he needed it and much better ones than he could have made up for himself girls are useful in some ways so he was living in clover when unfortunately they went and quarrelled about something don't see what that's got to do with it i said nor don't i rejoined edward but anyhow the notes and things stopped and so did the shillings bobby was fairly cornered for he had bought two ferrets on tick and promised to pay a shilling a week thinking the shillings were going on for ever the silly young ass so when the week was up and he was being dunned for the shilling he went off to the fellow and said your bella implores you to meet her at sundown by the hollow oak as of old be it only for a moment do not fail he got all that out of some rotten book of course the fellow looked puzzled and said what hollow oak i don't know any hollow oak perhaps it was the royal oak said bobby promptly cos he saw he had made a slip through trusting too much to the rotten book but this didn't seem to make the fellow any happier should think not i said the royal oak's an awful low sort of pub i know said edward well at last the fellow said i think i know what she means the hollow tree in your father's paddock it happens to be an elm but she wouldn't know the difference all right say i'll be there bobby hung about a bit for he hadn't got his money she was crying awfully he said then he got his shilling and wasn't the fellow riled i inquired when he got to the place and found nothing he found bobby said edward indignantly young ferris was a gentleman every inch of him he brought the fellow another message from bella i dare not leave the house my cruel parents immure me closely if you only knew what i suffer your bella out of the same rotten book this made the fellow a little suspicious cos it was the old ferrises who had been keen about the thing all through the fellow you see had tin but what's that got to i began again oh i dunno said edward impatiently i'm telling you just what bobby told me he got suspicious anyhow but he couldn't exactly call bella's brother a liar so bobby escaped for the time but when he was in a hole next week over a stiff french exercise and tried the same sort of game on his sister she was too sharp for him and he got caught out somehow women seem more mistrustful than men they're so beastly suspicious by nature you know i know said i but did the two the fellow and the sister make it up afterwards i don't remember about that replied edward indifferently but bobby got packed off to school a whole year earlier than his people meant to send him which was just what he wanted so you see it all came right in the end an idyl of plain people hilda had not spent her nineteen years in the glare of the spartan publicity in which the masses live without establishing a character just as she knew all the good points and bad in all the people of that community so they knew all hers and therefore knew what it was possible for her to do and what impossible and if a baseless lie is swift of foot where everybody minutely scrutinizes everybody else it is also scant of breath sophie's scandal soon dwindled to a whisper and expired and the kindlier and probable explanation of hilda's wan face and downcast eyes was generally accepted her code of morals and her method of dealing with moral questions were those of all the people about her strict severe primitive feuerstein was a cheat a traitor she cast him out of her heart cast him out at once and utterly and for ever she could think of him only with shame and it seemed to her that she was herself no longer pure she had touched pitch how could she be undefiled she accepted these conclusions and went about her work too busy to indulge in hysteria of remorse repining she avoided otto taking care not to be left alone with him when he called on sundays and putting sophie between him and her when he came up to them in the square but otto was awaiting his chance and when it came plunged boldly into his and floundered bravely about i don't like to see you so sad hilda isn't there any chance for me can't things be as they used to be hilda shook her head sadly i'm never going to marry she said you must find some one else it's you or nobody i said that when we were in school together and i'll stick to it his eyes confirmed his words you mustn't otto you make me feel as if i were spoiling your life and if you knew you wouldn't want to marry me i don't care i always have and i always will i suppose i ought to tell you she said half to herself she turned to him suddenly and with flushed cheeks and eyes that shifted burst out otto he was a married man but you didn't know it doesn't change the way i feel you might any man might throw it up to me and sooner or later everybody'll know no man would want a girl that had had a scandal like that on her i would he said and i do and it isn't a scandal some one joined them and he had no chance to continue until the following sunday when heiligs and brauners went together to the bronx for a they could not set out until their shops closed at twelve and they had to be back at five to reopen for the sunday supper customers they lunched under the trees in the yard of a german inn and a merry party they were hilda forgot to keep up her pretense that her healing wounds were not healing and never would heal she teased otto and even flirted with him this elevated her father and his mother to hilarity they were two very sensible people with a keen sense of humor the experience of age added to the simplicity and gaiety of youth you would have paused to admire and envy had you passed that way and looked in under the trees as they clinked glasses and called one to another and went off into gales of mirth over nothing at all what laughter is so gay as laughter at nothing at all any one must laugh when there is something to laugh at but to laugh just because one must have an outlet for bubbling spirits there's the test of happiness after luncheon they wandered into the woods and soon otto and hilda found themselves alone seated by a little waterfall which in a quiet sentimental voice suggested that low tones were the proper tones to use in that place we've known each other always hilda said otto and we know all about each other why not dear she did not speak for several minutes you know i haven't any heart to give you she answered at last otto did not know anything of the kind but he knew she thought so and he was too intelligent to dispute when time would settle the question and he felt sure would settle it right so he reached out and took her hand and said i'll risk that and they sat watching the waterfall and listening to it and they were happy in a serious tranquil way it filled him with awe to think that he had at last won her as for her she was looking forward without illusions without regrets to a life of work and content beside this strong loyal manly man who protested little but never failed her or any one else on the way home in the train she told her mother and her mother told her father he then and there to the great delight and pleasure of the others in the car rose up and embraced and kissed first his daughter then otto and then otto's mother and every once in a while he beamed down the line of his party and said this is a happy day prologue on june alexander spotswood governor of the colony of virginia and a gallant soldier who had served under marlborough in the english wars rode at the head of a dauntless band of cavaliers down the quiet street of quaint old williamsburg the adventurous spirits of this party of men urged them toward the land of the setting sun that unknown west far beyond the blue crested mountains rising so grandly before them months afterward they stood on the western range of the great north mountains towering above the picturesque shenandoah valley and from the summit of one of the loftiest peaks where until then the foot of a white man had never trod they viewed the vast expanse of plain and forest with glistening eyes returning to williamsburg they told of the wonderful richness of the newly discovered country and thus opened the way for the venturesome pioneer who was destined to overcome all difficulties and make a home in the western world but fifty years and more passed before a white man penetrated far beyond the purple spires of those majestic mountains one bright morning in june the figure of a stalwart broad shouldered man could have been seen standing on the wild and rugged promontory which rears its rocky bluff high above the ohio river at a point near the mouth of wheeling creek he was alone save for the companionship of a deerhound that crouched at his feet as he leaned on a long rifle contemplating the glorious scene that stretched before him a smile flashed across his bronzed cheek and his heart bounded as he forecast the future of that spot in the river below him lay an island so round and green that it resembled a huge lily pad floating placidly on the water the fresh green foliage of the trees sparkled with glittering dewdrops back of him rose the high ridges and in front as far as eye could reach extended an unbroken forest beneath him to the left and across a deep ravine he saw a wide level clearing the few scattered and blackened tree stumps showed the ravages made by a forest fire in the years gone by the field was now overgrown with hazel and laurel bushes and intermingling with them were the trailing arbutus the honeysuckle and the wild rose a fragrant perfume was wafted upward to him a rushing creek bordered one edge of the clearing after a long quiet reach of water which could be seen winding back in the hills the stream tumbled madly over a rocky ledge and white with foam it hurried onward as if impatient of long restraint and lost its individuality in the broad ohio this solitary hunter was colonel ebenezer zane he was one of those daring men who as the tide of emigration started westward had left his friends and family and had struck out alone into the wilderness departing from his home in eastern virginia he had plunged into the woods and after many days of hunting and exploring he reached the then far western ohio valley the scene so impressed colonel zane that he concluded to found a settlement there taking tomahawk possession of the locality which consisted of blazing a few trees with his tomahawk he built himself a rude shack and remained that summer on the ohio in the autumn he set out for berkeley county virginia to tell his people of the magnificent country he had discovered the following spring he persuaded a number of settlers of a like spirit with himself to accompany him to the wilderness believing it unsafe to take their families with them at once they left them at red stone on the monongahela river while the men including colonel zane his brothers silas andrew jonathan and isaac the wetzels mccollochs bennets metzars and others pushed on ahead the country through which they passed was one tangled most impenetrable forest the axe of the pioneer had never sounded in this region where every rod of the way might harbor some unknown danger these reckless bordermen knew not the meaning of fear to all daring adventure was welcome and the screech of a redskin and the ping of a bullet were familiar sounds to the wetzels mccollochs and jonathan zane the hunting of indians was the most thrilling passion of their lives indeed the wetzels particularly knew no other occupation they had attained a wonderful skill with the rifle long practice had rendered their senses as acute as those of the fox skilled in every variety of woodcraft with lynx eyes ever on the alert for detecting a trail or the curling smoke of some camp fire or the minutest sign of an enemy these men stole onward through the forest with the cautious but dogged and persistent determination that was characteristic of the settler they at length climbed the commanding bluff overlooking the majestic river and as they gazed out on the undulating and uninterrupted area of green their hearts beat high with hope the keen axe wielded by strong arms soon opened the clearing and reared stout log cabins on the river bluff then ebenezer zane and his followers moved their families and soon the settlement began to grow and flourish as the little village commenced to prosper the redmen became troublesome settlers were shot while plowing the fields or gathering the harvests bands of hostile indians prowled around and made it dangerous for anyone to leave the clearing frequently the first person to appear in the early morning would be shot at by an indian concealed in the woods off to the woods whether danny rugg was afraid the principal had seen him trying to force a fight on bert or whether the unexpected fall that came to him caused it no one knew but certainly for the next few days danny let bert alone when he passed him he scowled or shook his fist or muttered something about getting even but this was all perhaps it was the thought of what bert had seen fall from danny's pocket that made the bully less anxious to keep up the quarrel at any rate bert was left alone and he was glad of it he was not afraid but he liked peace the school days went on and the classes settled down to their work for the long winter term and the thought of the snow and ice that would comparatively soon be with them made the bobbsey twins rejoice charley mason and i are going to make a dandy big bob this year said bert one day it's going to carry ten fellows and no girls asked nan with a smile she was walking along behind her brother with grace and nellie sure we'll let you girls ride once in a while said charley as he caught up to his chum but you can't steer i steered a bob once said grace who was quite athletic for her age it was danny rugg's too pooh his is a little one alongside the one charley and i are going to make exclaimed bert ours will be hard to steer and it's going to have a gong on it to tell folks to get out of the way that's right agreed charley and we'd better start it right away bert it may soon snow it doesn't feel so now spoke nan it is very warm it feels more like

cream in the funny little cones was much enjoyed by all bert and charley walked on together eating and talking of the bob sled they were going to make they passed danny rugg who looked rather enviously at them hey charley called danny come here i want to speak to you i'm busy now answered charley bert and i have something to do so have i i've got a dandy plan well i'll see you later spoke charley he had once been quite friendly with danny but he grew not to like his ways and so became more chummy with bert who was very glad for he liked charley the two boys went on to bert's barn where they were going to build the bob sled the girls with flossie and freddie went on the bobbsey lawn where there were some easy chairs they sat in the shade of the trees and freddie had snap do some of his tricks for the visitors can he jump through a hoop covered with paper as they do in the circus asked nellie oh we never thought to try that said freddie i'm going to make one and filled with this new idea he hurried into the house dinah he said i want some paper and paste land sakes chile what yo gwine t do now asked the colored cook make a kite an take snoop up in de air laik yo brother bert done once no we're not going to do that answered the little boy we're going to cover a hoop with paper and make snap jump through it like in a circus mah goodness mustard pot cried dinah what will yo all be up to next i don't know answered freddie but will you make me some paste dinah and you know we haven't got snoop anyhow so we couldn't send him up on a kite tail added freddie josephine opens the sluices entering the bud found echo surrounded by several girls from florence and the neighboring ranches who were driving her almost distracted with their admiring attentions for she was greatly disturbed about her lover's inexplicable absence had she been free from the duties of hospitality she would have leaped on her horse and gone in search of him echo's would seem as incongruous as jack's to the eyes of an easterner yet it was entirely suited to the circumstances for the couple intended as soon as they were married to ride to a little of jack's in the tortilla mountains where they would spend their honeymoon she was dressed in an which she had brought from the east the skirt was divided and reached just below the knee her blouse of lighter material and brown in color was loose allowing free play for her arms and shoulders high were laced to the knee a sombrero and lay on the table ready to complete her costume bud coldly acknowledged echo's affectionate and happy greeting and curtly informed her that jack had arrived she rushed out of doors with a cry of joy running across the courtyard toward her lover who awaited her with outstretched arms she began well this is a nice time you outrageous when polly stopped her with a look wait a minute wait a minute the girl drawled as if reining in a too eager horse don't commence calling before you get the hitch time enough after he has been actin up something scandalous with me jack threw up his hands in protest hastily denying any probable charge that the tease might make why i haven't been saying a word he cried polly laughed as she ran to the door no you haven't she answered mockingly as one agrees with a child whose feelings have been hurt he's only been tellin me he loved pausing an instant she pointed at echo ending her sentence with a shouted you with her hand on jack's shoulder echo said polly you are a flirt you've too many strings to your bow you mean i've too many beaux to my string laughingly answered the girl you'll have slim hoover and bud lane shooting each other up all on your account chided echo nothing of the kind pouted polly can't a girl have friends but i know what you two are waiting for what asked jack you want me to vamose i'm hep i'll vam and polly ran into the kitchen to tell the men that the bridegroom had arrived but couldn't be seen until the bride was through with an important interview with him so she hustled them all into the where the girls were this room was a long and low apartment roughly plastered the heavy hewn with axes were uncovered giving an old english effect although this was not striven for but made under the stress of necessity the broad windows were trellised with vines through which filtered the sunshine a cooling evening breeze stirred the leaves lazily the chairs were broad and comfortable the workmanship of the monks of the neighboring mission in the corners stood squat earthen of mexican molding on the adobe walls were hung trophies of the hunt and the crudely made adornments of the apaches navajo blankets covered the and were used as screens for sets of shelves built into the spaces between the windows polly carried in on a tray a large bowl of punch surrounded by glasses and gourds this was received with riotous demonstrations she placed it in the center of a table made of planks laid on trestles and assisted by the other girls served the men liberally from the bowl the guests showed the effects of outdoor life and training their gestures were full and free the tones of their voices were but they spoke more slowly than their eastern cousins as if feeling the necessity even when confined of making every word carry no one lolled in his seat but sat upright as if still having the feel of the saddle under him toward women in all social gatherings the cowboys act with exaggerated chivalry but as would describe it they herd by their lonesome there is none of the commingling of sexes seen in the east at a dance the girls sit at one end of the room the men group themselves about the doorway until the music strikes up then each will seize his partner after the boldest has made the first move when the ends the cowboy will rarely escort partner to her seat but will leave her to find her way back to her chum while he moves sheepishly back to the doorway to be received by his fellows with slaps on the back and loud jests at table cowboys carry on little conversation with the girls they talk amongst themselves but at the women the presence of the girls leads them to play many pranks on one another the ice is long in breaking for their habitual reserve is not easily worn off later in the evening this shyness is less marked as jack and echo entered the doorway parenthesis had arisen from his seat at the head of table and was beginning fellow citizens the love of ulrich nebendahl perhaps of all it troubled most the herr pfarrer was he not the father of the village and as such did it not fall to him to see his children marry well and suitably marry in any case it was the duty of every worthy citizen to keep alive throughout the ages the sacred hearth fire to rear up sturdy lads and honest lassies that would serve god and the fatherland a true son of saxon soil was the herr pastor winckelmann kindly simple sentimental why at your age ulrich at your age repeated the herr pastor setting down his beer and wiping with the back of his hand his large uneven lips i was the father of a family two boys and a girl you never saw her ulrich so sweet so good we called her maria the herr pfarrer sighed and hid his broad red face behind the raised cover of his pewter pot they must be good fun in a house the little ones commented ulrich gazing upward with his dreamy eyes at the wreath of smoke ascending from his pipe the little ones always my heart goes out to them take to yourself a wife urged the herr pfarrer it is your duty the good god has given to you ample means it is not right that you should lead this lonely life bachelors make old maids things of no use that is so ulrich agreed i have often said the same unto myself it would be pleasant to feel one was not working merely for oneself elsa now went on the herr pfarrer she is a good child pious and economical the price of such is above rubies ulrich's face lightened with a pleasant smile aye elsa is a good girl he answered her little hands have you ever noticed them herr pastor so soft and dimpled the pfarrer pushed aside his empty pot and leaned his elbows on the table i think i do not think she would say no her mother i have reason to believe let me sound them discreetly the old pastor's red face glowed redder yet with pleasurable anticipation he was a born matchmaker but ulrich the wheelwright shuffled in his chair uneasily a little longer he pleaded let me think it over a man should not marry without first being sure he loves things might happen it would not be fair to the maiden the herr pfarrer stretched his hand across the table and laid it upon ulrich's arm it is hedwig twice you walked home with her last week it is a lonesome way for a timid maiden and there is the stream to cross explained the wheelwright for a moment the herr pastor's face had clouded but now it cleared again well well why not elsa would have been better in some respects but hedwig ah yes she too is a good girl a little wild perhaps it will wear off have you spoken with her not yet but you will again there fell that troubled look into those dreamy eyes this time it was ulrich who laying aside his pipe rested his great arms upon the wooden table now how does a man know when he is in love asked ulrich of the pastor who having been married twice should surely be experienced upon the point how should he be sure that it is this woman and no other to whom his heart has gone out a man was the herr pastor short and fat and bald but there had been other days and these had left to him a voice that still was young and the evening twilight screening the seared face ulrich heard but the pastor's voice which was the voice of a boy she will be dearer to you than yourself thinking of her all else will be as nothing for her you would lay down your life they sat in silence for a while for the fat little herr pfarrer was dreaming of the past and long lanky ulrich nebendahl the wheelwright of the future that evening as chance would have it ulrich returning to his homestead a rambling mill beside the river where he dwelt alone with ancient anna met elsa of the dimpled hands upon the bridge that spans the murmuring muhlde and talked a while with her and said how sweet it had been to watch her eyes shyly seeking his to press her dimpled hand and feel his own great strength surely he loved her better than he did himself there could be no doubt of it he pictured her in trouble in danger from the savage soldiery that came and went like evil shadows through these pleasant saxon valleys leaving death and misery behind them burnt homesteads women hiding their faces from the light would he not for her sake give his life so it was made clear to him that little elsa was his love until next morning when raising his eyes from the whirling saw there stood before him margot laughing margot wayward that would ever be to him the baby he had played with nursed and comforted margot weary had he not a thousand times carried her sleeping in his arms margot in danger at the mere thought his face flushed an angry scarlet by dicky well annie i have bad news for you said mr ridgway as he entered the comfortable of his cabin in the bush sam redfern the bushranger is about this part of the bush just now i hope he will not attack us with his gang i hope not responded annie a gentle maiden of some sixteen summers just then came a knock at the door of the hut and a gruff voice asked them to open the door it is sam redfern the bushranger father said the girl the same responded the voice and the next moment the hall door was smashed in and sam redfern sprang in followed by his gang chapter ii father was at once overpowered and annie herself lay bound with cords on the sofa sam redfern set a guard round the lonely hut and all human aid was despaired of but you never know far away in the bush a different scene was being enacted must be injuns said a tall man to himself as he pushed his way through the brushwood it was jim carlton the celebrated detective i know them he added they are apaches just then ten indians in full appeared carlton raised his rifle and fired and slinging their scalps on his arm he hastened towards the humble log hut where resided his affianced bride annie ridgway sometimes known as the flower of the bush chapter iii the moon was low on the horizon and sam redfern was seated at a drinking bout with some of his boon companions they had rifled the cellars of the hut and the rich wines flowed like water in the golden goblets of mr ridgway but annie had made friends with one of the gang a noble man who had joined sam redfern by mistake and she had told him to go and get the police as quickly as possible ha ha cried redfern now i am enjoying myself he little knew that his doom was near upon him just then annie gave a piercing scream and sam redfern got up seizing his revolver who are you he cried as a man entered i am jim carlton the celebrated detective said the new arrival sam revolver dropped from his nerveless fingers but the next moment he had sprung upon the detective with the activity of the mountain sheep and annie shrieked for she had grown to love the rough bushranger to be continued at the end of the paper if there is room scholastic a new slate is horrid till it is washed in milk i like the green spots on them to draw patterns round i know a good way to make a squeak but i put it in because i want to make it common peppermint is a great help with arithmetic the boy who was second in the oxford local always did it he gave me two the examiner said to him are you eating peppermints and he said no sir he told me afterwards it was quite true because he was only sucking one glad i asked i should never have thought of that and i could have had to say yes oswald the wreck of the malabar by noel author of a dream of ancient ancestors he really but he put it in to make it seem more real hark what is that noise of rolling waves and thunder in the air tis the of the sailors and officers and passengers of the good ship malabar it was a fair and lovely noon when the good ship put out of port and people said ah little we think how soon she will be the elements sport she was indeed a lovely sight upon the billows with sails spread but the captain folded his gloomy arms ah if she had been a instead see the captain stern yet gloomy flings his son upon a rock hoping that there his darling boy may escape the wreck alas in vain the loud winds roared and nobody was saved that was the wreck of the malabar then let us toll for the brave noel gardening notes it is useless to plant in the hope of eating the fruit because they alice lend her gardening tools again because the last time noel left them out in the rain and i like it he said he seeds and bulbs these are useful to play at shop with until you are ready not at for they will not grow unless uncooked potatoes are not grown with seed but with potatoes apple trees are grown from twigs which is less wasteful oak trees come from acorns every one knows this when noel says he could grow one from a peach stone wrapped up in oak leaves he shows that he knows nothing about gardening but marigolds and when i passed by his garden i thought they seemed just like weeds now the flowers have been picked a boy once dared me to eat a bulb dogs are very industrious and fond of gardening pincher is always planting bones but they never grow up there be a bone tree i think this is what makes him bark so unhappily at night he has never tried planting but he is fonder of bones and perhaps he wants to be quite sure about them first i the nellie a cruising yawl swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails and was at rest the flood had made the wind was nearly calm and being bound down the river the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide the of the thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway in the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked with gleams of varnished sprits a haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness the air was dark above gravesend and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom brooding motionless over the biggest and the greatest town on earth the director of companies was our captain and our host we four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward on the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical he resembled a pilot which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified it was difficult to realize his work was not out there in the luminous estuary but behind him within the brooding gloom between us there was as i have already said somewhere the bond of the sea besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's yarns and even convictions the lawyer the best of old fellows had because of his many years and many virtues the only cushion on deck and was lying on the only rug the accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes and was toying architecturally with the bones marlow sat right aft leaning against the he had sunken cheeks a yellow complexion a straight back an ascetic aspect and with his arms dropped the palms of hands outwards resembled an idol the director satisfied the anchor had good hold made his way aft and sat down amongst us we exchanged a few words lazily afterwards there was silence on board the yacht for some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes we felt meditative and fit for nothing but placid staring the day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance the water shone pacifically the sky without a speck was a benign immensity of unstained light the very mist on the essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric hung from the wooded rises inland and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds only the gloom to the west brooding over the upper reaches became more sombre every minute as if angered by the approach of the sun and at last in its curved and imperceptible fall the sun sank low and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat as if about to go out suddenly stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men forthwith a change came over the waters and the serenity became less brilliant but more profound the old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline of day after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth we looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever but in the august light of abiding memories and indeed nothing is easier for a man who has as the phrase goes followed the sea with reverence and affection than to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the thames the tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea it had known and served all the men of whom the nation is proud from sir francis drake to sir john franklin knights all titled and untitled the great of the sea it had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time from the golden hind returning with her rotund flanks full of treasure to be visited by the queen's highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale to the erebus and terror bound on other conquests and that never returned it had known the ships and the men they had sailed from deptford from greenwich from erith the adventurers and the settlers kings ships and the ships of men on change captains admirals the dark interlopers of the eastern trade and the commissioned generals of east india fleets hunters for gold or pursuers of fame they all had gone out on that stream bearing the sword and often the torch messengers of the might within the land bearers of a spark from the sacred fire what greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth the dreams of men the seed of commonwealths the germs of empires ii as wyant emerged from the house he paused once more to glance up at its scarred brick facade the marble hand drooped tragically above the entrance in the waning light it seemed to have relaxed into the passiveness of despair and wyant stood musing on its hidden meaning but the dead hand was not the only mysterious thing about doctor house what were the relations between miss lombard and her father above all between miss lombard and her picture she did not look like a person capable of a disinterested passion for the arts and there had been moments when it struck wyant that she hated the picture the sky at the end of the street was flooded with turbulent yellow light and the young man turned his steps toward the church of san domenico in the hope of catching the lingering brightness on st catherine the great bare aisles were almost dark when he entered and he had to grope his way to the chapel steps under the momentary evocation of the sunset the figure emerged pale and swooning from the dusk and the warm light gave a sensual tinge to her ecstasy the flesh seemed to glow and heave the eyelids to tremble wyant stood fascinated by the accidental collaboration of light and color suddenly he noticed that something white had fluttered to the ground at his feet he stooped and picked up a small thin sheet of folded and sealed like an letter and bearing the superscription to the count ottaviano celsi wyant stared at this mysterious document where had it come from he was distinctly conscious of having seen it fall through the air close to his feet he glanced up at the dark ceiling of the chapel then he turned and looked about the church there was only one figure in it that of a man who knelt near the high altar suddenly wyant recalled the question of doctor was this the letter she had asked for had he been unconsciously carrying it about with him all the afternoon who was count ottaviano celsi and how came wyant to have been chosen to act as that ambulant wyant laid his hat and stick on the chapel steps and began to explore his pockets in the irrational hope of finding there some clue to the mystery but they held nothing which he had not himself put there and he was reduced to wondering how the letter supposing some unknown hand to have bestowed it on him had happened to fall out while he stood motionless before the picture at this point he was disturbed by a step on the floor of the aisle and turning he saw his neighbor of the table the young man bowed and waved an apologetic hand i do not intrude he inquired suavely without waiting for a reply he mounted the steps of the chapel glancing about him with the affable air of an afternoon caller i see he remarked with a smile that you know the hour at which our saint should be visited wyant agreed that the hour was indeed felicitous the stranger stood beamingly before the picture what grace what poetry he murmured apostrophizing the st catherine but letting his glance slip rapidly about the chapel as he spoke wyant detecting the manoeuvre murmured a brief assent but it is cold here mortally cold you do not find it so the intruder put on his hat it is permitted at this hour when the church is empty and you my dear sir do you not feel the dampness you are an artist are you not and to artists it is permitted to cover the head when they are engaged in the study of the paintings he darted suddenly toward the steps and bent over hat permit me cover yourself he said a moment later holding out the hat with an ingratiating gesture a light flashed on wyant perhaps he said looking straight at the young man you will tell me your name my own is wyant the stranger surprised but not disconcerted drew forth a coroneted card which he offered with a low bow on the card was engraved il conte ottaviano celsi i am much obliged to you said wyant and i may as well tell you that the letter which you apparently expected to find in the lining of my hat is not there but in my pocket he drew it out and handed it to its owner who had grown very pale and now wyant continued you will perhaps be good enough to tell me what all this means there was no mistaking the effect produced on count ottaviano by this request his lips moved but he achieved only an ineffectual smile i suppose you know wyant went on his anger rising at the sight of the discomfiture that you have taken an unwarrantable liberty i yet understand what part i have been made to play but evident that you have made use of me to serve some purpose of your own and i propose to know the reason why count ottaviano advanced with an imploring gesture sir he pleaded you permit me to speak i expect you to cried wyant but not here he added hearing the clank of the keys it is growing dark and we shall be turned out in a few minutes v a girl captain when wilbur came on deck the morning after the sinking of the bark he was surprised to find the schooner under way again wilbur and charlie had berthed forward during that night charlie with the hands wilbur in the captain's hammock the reason for this change of quarters had been found in a peremptory order from moran during the the preceding evening she had looked squarely at wilbur from under her scowl and had said briefly and in a fine contralto voice that he had for the first time noted i berth aft in the cabin you and the chinaman forward understand moran had only forestalled wilbur's intention while after her almost miraculous piece of seamanship in the rescue of the schooner charlie and the chinese crew accorded her a respect that was almost superstitious wilbur met her again at breakfast she was still wearing men's clothing part of kitchell's outfit and was booted to the knee but now she wore no hat and her enormous mane of hair was braided into long strands near to the thickness of a man's arm the redness of her face gave a startling effect to her pale blue eyes and sandy heavy eyebrows that easily lowered to a frown she ate with her knife and after pushing away her plate wilbur observed that she drank half a tumbler of whiskey and water the conversation between the two was tame enough there was no common ground upon which they could meet to her father's death no doubt an old matter even before her rescue she made no allusion her attitude toward wilbur was one of defiance and suspicion only once did she relax how did you come to be aboard here with these you're no sailor she said abruptly huh laughed wilbur mirthlessly huh i was shanghaied moran smote the table with a red fist and shouted with sonorous laughter shanghaied you now that is really good and what are you going to do now what are you going to do signal the first vessel and be taken into frisco i've my insurance to collect wilbur had given her the letty's papers and the disaster to report well i'm not keen on myself said wilbur but moran showed no interest in his plans however they soon found that they were not to be permitted to signal at noon the same day the schooner sighted a steamship's smoke on the horizon and began to raise her rapidly moran immediately bound on the ensign union down and broke it out at the peak charlie who was at the wheel spoke a sentence in chinese and one of the hands drew his knife across the halyards and brought the distress signal to the deck moran turned upon charlie with an oath her brows knitted no no sang charlie closing his eyes and wagging his head no too muchee los time no can stop you come downside cabin you an boss number two this was wilbur have um the odd conclave assembled about kitchell's table the the girl in men's clothes and the chinaman the conference was an angry one wilbur and moran insisting that they be put aboard the steamship charlie refusing with calm obstinacy i have um with china boys las nigh china boy heap flaid no can stop um steamship heap flaid too much no stop go fish now go fish los heap time go fish i no savvy sail um boat china boy no savvy sail um boat i tink um you savvy and he pointed to moran i tink um you savvy plenty heap much disa bay boss number two him no savvy sail um boat but him savvy plenty many all same and we're to stop on board your and navigate her for you shouted moran her face blazing charlie nodded blandly i tink um yass and when we get back to port exclaimed wilbur you think perhaps i we won't make it interesting for you charlie smiled i tink um six company heap rich well get along ordered moran as though the schooner was her property and we'll talk it over china boy like you heap pretty big said charlie to moran as he went out you savvy sail um boat all light wanta you fo captain but he added suddenly dropping his bland passivity as though he wore a mask and for an instant allowing the wicked malevolent cantonese to come to the surface china boy no likee funnee business savvy then with a smile of a talleyrand he disappeared moran and wilbur were helpless for the present they were but two against seven chinamen they must stay on board if the coolies wished it and if they were to stay it was a matter of their own personal safety that the bertha millner should be properly navigated i'll captain her concluded moran sullenly at the end of their talk you must act as mate mr wilbur and don't get any mistaken idea into your head that because i'm a young girl and alone you are going to run things your way i don't like funny business any better than charlie look here said wilbur complaining don't think i'm altogether a villain i think you're a ripping fine girl you're different from any kind of girl i ever met of course but you by jingo you're you're splendid there in the squall last evening when you stood at the wheel with your hair chapter xii the rev mr ware found levi gorringe's readily enough but its owner was not in he probably would be back again though in a quarter of an hour or so the boy said and the minister at once decided to wait theron was interested in finding that this was no other than harvey the lad who brought milk to the parsonage every morning he remembered now that he had heard good things of this urchin as to the hard work he did to help his mother the widow semple in her struggle to keep a roof over her head and also bad things in that he did not come regularly either to church or the clergyman recalled too that harvey had impressed him as a character well sonny are you going to be a lawyer he asked as he seated himself by the window and looked about him first at the dusty litter of old papers pamphlets and documents in bundles which crowded the stuffy chamber and then at the boy himself harvey was busy at a big box a rough pine box which bore the flaring label of an express company and also of a seed firm in a western city and which the boy had apparently just opened he was lifting from it and placing on the table after he had shaken off the sawdust and moss in which they were packed small parcels of what looked in the fading light to be plants well i don't know i rather guess not he made answer as he pursued his task so far as i can make out this wouldn't be the place to start in at if i was going to be a lawyer a boy can learn here how to load cartridges and clean a gun and braid on to leaders but i don't see much law laying around loose anyway he went on i couldn't afford to read law and not be getting any wages i have to earn money you know theron felt that he liked the boy yes he said with a kindly tone i've heard that you are a good industrious youngster i daresay mr gorringe will see to it that you get a chance to read law and get wages too oh i can read all there is here and welcome the boy explained stepping toward the window to decipher the label on a bundle of roots in his hand but that's no good unless there's regular practice coming into the office all the while that's how you learn to be a lawyer but gorringe don't have what i call a practice at all he just sees men in the other room there with the door shut and whatever there is to do he does it all himself the minister remembered a stray hint somewhere that mr gorringe was a what was colloquially called a to his rustic sense there was something not quite nice about that occupation it would be indecorous he felt to encourage further talk about it from the boy what are you doing there he inquired to change the subject sorting out some plants replied harvey i don't know what's got into gorringe lately this is the third big box he's had since i've been here that is in six weeks besides two baskets full of i don't know what he does with them he carries them off himself somewhere i've had kind of half a notion that he's figurin on getting married i can't think of anything else that would make a man spend money like water just for flowers and bushes they do get foolish you know when they've got marriage on the brain theron found himself only imperfectly following the theories of the young philosopher it was his fact that monopolized the minister's attention but as i understand it he remarked hesitatingly brother gorringe or rather mr gorringe gets all the plants he wants everything he likes from a big garden somewhere outside i don't know that it is exactly his but i remember hearing something to that effect the boy slapped the last litter off his hands and as he came to the window shook his head these don't come from no garden outside he declared they come from the dealers and he pays solid cash for em the invoice for this lot alone was dollars and sixty cents there it is on the table you can see it for yourself mr ware did not offer to look very likely these are for the garden i was speaking of he said of course you can't go on taking plants out of a garden indefinitely without putting others in i don't know anything about any garden that he takes plants out of answered harvey and looked meditatively for a minute or two out upon the street below then he turned to the minister your wife's doing a good deal of gardening this spring i notice he said casually you'd hardly think it was the same place she's fixed it up so if she wants any extra hoeing done i can always get off saturday afternoons i will remember said theron he also looked out of the window and nothing more was said until a few moments later mr gorringe himself came in chapter mrs dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former favourite she rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt she was sorry for him she wished him happy but the feelings of the past could not be recalled nothing could restore him with a faith unbroken a character unblemished to marianne nothing could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his means nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards eliza nothing could replace him therefore in her former esteem nor injure the interests of colonel brandon had mrs dashwood like her daughter heard willoughby's story from himself had she witnessed his distress and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner it is probable that her compassion would have been greater but it was neither in elinor's power nor in her wish to rouse such feelings in another by her retailed explanation as had at first been called forth in herself reflection had given calmness to her judgment and sobered her own opinion of willoughby's deserts she wished therefore to declare only the simple truth and lay open such facts as were really due to his character without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray in the evening when they were all three together marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again but that it was not without an effort the restless unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sitting her rising colour as she spoke and her unsteady voice plainly shewed i wish to assure you both said she that i see every thing as you can desire me to do mrs dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness had not elinor who really wished to hear her sister's unbiased opinion by an eager sign engaged her silence marianne slowly continued it is a great relief to me what elinor told me this morning i have now heard exactly what i wished to hear for some moments her voice was lost but recovering herself she added and with greater calmness than before i am now perfectly satisfied i wish for no change i never could have been happy with him after knowing as sooner or later i must have known all this i should have had no confidence no esteem nothing could have done it away to my feelings i know it i know it cried her mother happy with a man of libertine practices with one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends and the best of men nomy marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man her conscience her sensitive conscience would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt marianne sighed and repeated i wish for no change you consider the matter said elinor exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it and i dare say you perceive as well as myself not only in this but in many other circumstances reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection on his side much less certain had you married you must have been always poor his expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself and his whole conduct declares that is a word hardly understood by him his demands and your inexperience together on a small very small income must have brought on distresses which would not be the less grievous to you from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before your sense of honour and honesty would have led you i know when aware of your situation to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible and perhaps as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort you might have been suffered to practice it but beyond that and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage beyond that had you endeavoured however reasonably to abridge his enjoyments is it not to be feared that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it you would have lessened your own influence on his heart and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties marianne's lips quivered and she repeated the word selfish in a tone that implied do you really think him selfish the whole of his behaviour replied elinor from the beginning to the end of the affair has been grounded on selfishness it was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections which afterwards when his own were engaged made him delay the confession of it and which finally carried him from barton his own enjoyment or his own ease was in every particular his ruling principle it is very true my happiness never was his object at present continued elinor he regrets what he has done and why does he regret it because he finds it has not answered towards himself it has not made him happy his circumstances are now unembarrassed he suffers from no evil of that kind and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself but does it follow that had he married you he would have been happy the inconveniences would have been different he would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which because they are removed he now reckons as nothing he would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint but he would have been always necessitous always poor and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance even to domestic happiness than the mere temper of a wife tom is imprisoned well i must say he's a cool one remarked tom as the echoes of mr berg's steps died away the idea of thinking his boat better than ours i don't like that man dad i'm suspicious of him do you think he came here to steal some of our ideas no i hardly believe so my son but how did you discover him just as you saw dad i heard a noise and went back there to investigate i found him sneaking around looking at the electric propeller plates i went to grab him just as he stumbled over a board at first i thought it was one of the old gang i'm almost sure he was trying to discover something no tom the firm he works for are good business men and they would not countenance anything like that they are heartless competitors however and if they saw a legitimate chance to get ahead of me and take advantage they would do it but they would not sneak in to steal my ideas i feel sure of that besides they have a certain type of submarine which they think is the best ever invented and they would hardly change at this late day they feel sure of winning the government prize and i'm just as glad we're not going to have a contest do you think our boat is better than theirs much better in many respects i don't like that man berg though went on tom nor do i added his father there is something strange about him he was very anxious that i should compete probably he thought his firm's boat would go so far ahead of ours that they would get an extra bonus but i'm glad he didn't see our new method of propulsion that is the principal improvement in the advance over other types of submarines well another week and we will be ready for the test have you known mr berg long dad not very i met him in washington when i was in the patent office he was taking out papers on a submarine for his firm at the same time i got mine for the advance it is rather curious that he should come all the way here from philadelphia merely to see if i was going to compete there is something strange about it something that i can't understand the time was to come when mr swift and his son were to get at the bottom of mr berg's reasons and they learned to their sorrow that he had penetrated some of their secrets before going to bed that night tom and mr sharp paid a visit to the shed where the submarine was resting on the ways ready for launching they found mr jackson on guard and the engineer said that no one had been around nor was anything found disturbed it certainly is a great machine remarked the lad as he looked up at the bulk towering over his head dad has outdone himself this trip it looks all right commented mr sharp whether it will work is another question yes we can't tell until it's in the water conceded tom but i hope it does dad has spent much time and money on it the advance was as her name indicated much in advance of previous submarines there was not so much difference in outward construction as there was in the means of propulsion and in the manner in which the interior and the machinery were arranged the submarine planned by mr swift and tom jointly and constructed by them with the aid of mr sharp and mr jackson was shaped like a cigar over one hundred feet long and twenty feet in diameter at the thickest part it was divided into many compartments all so that if one or even three were flooded the ship would still be useable buoyancy was provided for by having several tanks for the introduction of compressed air and there was an emergency arrangement so that a collapsible aluminum container could be distended and filled with a powerful gas this was to be used if by any means the ship was disabled on the bottom of the ocean the container could be expanded and filled and would send the advance to the surface another peculiar feature was that the dynamos and other apparatus were all contained amidships this gave stability to the craft and also enabled the same engine to operate both shafts and propellers as well as both the negative forward electrical plates and the positive rear ones these plates were a new idea in submarine construction and were the outcome of an idea of mr swift with some suggestions from his son the aged inventor did not want to depend on the usual screw propellers for his craft nor did he want to use a jet of compressed air shooting out from a rear tube nor yet a jet of water by means of which the creature called the squid shoots himself along mr swift planned to send the advance along under water by means of electricity certain peculiar plates were built at the forward and aft blunt noses of the submarine into the forward plate a negative charge of electricity was sent and into the one at the rear a positive charge just as one end of a horseshoe magnet is positive and will repel the north end of a compass needle while the other pole of a magnet is negative and will attract it in electricity like repels like while negative and positive have a mutual attraction for each other vi as we all went up it occurred to me that there ought to be a man at the helm i raised my voice not much above a whisper and noiselessly an uncomplaining spirit in a body appeared in the light aft the head with hollow eyes illuminated against the blackness which had swallowed up our world and the universe the bared forearm extended over the upper spokes seemed to shine with a light of its own i murmured to that luminous appearance keep the helm right amidships it answered in a tone of patient suffering right amidships sir then i descended to the it was impossible to tell whence the blow would come to look round the ship was to look into a bottomless black pit the eye lost itself in inconceivable depths i wanted to ascertain whether the ropes had been picked up off the deck one could only do that by feeling with feet in my cautious progress i came against a man in whom i recognized ransome he possessed an unimpaired physical solidity which was manifest to me at the contact he was leaning against the capstan and kept silent it was like a revelation he was the collapsed figure sobbing for breath i had noticed before we went on the poop you have been helping with the mainsail i exclaimed in a low tone yes sir sounded his quiet voice man what were you thinking of you do that sort of thing after a pause he assented i suppose i then after another short silence he added i am all right now quickly between the gasps i could neither hear nor see anybody else but when i spoke up answering sad murmurs filled the and its shadows seemed to shift here and there i ordered all the halyards laid down on deck clear for running see to that sir volunteered ransome in his natural pleasant tone which comforted one and aroused compassion too somehow that man ought to have been in his bed resting and my plain duty was to send him there but perhaps he would not have obeyed me i had not the strength of mind to try all i said was go about it quietly ransome returning on the poop i approached gambril his face set with hollow shadows in the light looked awful finally silenced i asked him how he felt but hardly expected an answer therefore i was astonished at his comparative loquacity them shakes leaves me as weak as a kitten sir he said preserving finely that air of unconsciousness as to anything but his business a helmsman should never lose and before i can pick up my strength that there hot fit comes along and knocks me over again he sighed there was no reproach in his tone but the bare words were enough to give me a horrible pang of it held me dumb for a time when the tormenting sensation had passed off i asked do you feel strong enough to prevent the rudder taking charge if she gets sternway on her it do to get something smashed about the now enough difficulties to cope with as it is he answered with just a shade of weariness that he was strong enough to hang on he could promise me that she take the wheel out of his hands more he say at that moment ransome appeared quite close to me stepping out of the darkness into visibility suddenly as if just created with his composed face and pleasant voice every rope on deck he said was laid down clear for running as far as one could make certain by feeling it was impossible to see anything frenchy had stationed himself forward he said he had a jump or two left in him yet here a faint smile altered for an instant the clear firm design of lips with his serious clear gray eyes his serene temperament he was a priceless man altogether soul as firm as the muscles of his body he was the only man on board except me but i had to preserve my liberty of movement who had a sufficiency of muscular strength to trust to for a moment i thought i had better ask him to take the wheel but the dreadful knowledge of the enemy he had to carry about him made me hesitate in my ignorance of physiology it occurred to me that he might die suddenly from excitement at a critical moment while this gruesome fear restrained the ready words on the tip of my tongue ransome stepped back two paces and vanished from my sight at once an uneasiness possessed me as if some support had been withdrawn i moved forward too outside the circle of light into the darkness that stood in front of me like a wall in one stride i penetrated it such must have been the darkness before creation it had closed behind me i knew i was invisible to the man at the helm neither could i see anything he was alone i was alone every man was alone where he stood and every form was gone too spar sail fittings rails everything was blotted out in the dreadful smoothness of that absolute night curse it appeared that for the present at any rate i was to have my residence in the royal pyramid the glittering cavalcade drew up in the great paved square which lies before the building and massed itself in groups the mammoth was halted before the doorway and when a stair had been brought the trumpets sounded and we three who had ridden in the golden under the canopy of snakes descended to the ground it was plain that we were going from beneath the open sky to the apartments which lay inside the vast stone mazes of the pyramid and without thinking the instinct of custom and reverence that had become part of my nature caused me to turn to where the towering rocks of the sacred mountain frowned above the city and make the usual obeisance and offer up in silence the prescribed prayer i say i did this thing unthinking and as a matter of common custom but when i rose to my feet i could have sworn i heard a titter of laughter from somewhere in that fancifully bedecked crowd of onlookers i glanced in the direction of the scoffers frowningly enough and then i turned to phorenice to demand their prompt punishment for the disrespect but here was a strange thing i had looked to see her in the act and article of rising from an obeisance but there she was standing erect and had clearly never touched her forehead to the ground moreover she was regarding me with a queer look which i could not fathom but whatever was in her mind she had no plan to bawl about it then before the people collected in the square she said to me come and turning to the doorway cried for entrance giving the secret word appointed for the day the ponderous stone blocks which barred the porch swung back on their hinges and with stately tread she passed out of the hot sunshine into the cool gloom beyond with the following decorously at her heels with a heaviness beginning to grow at my heart i too went inside the pyramid and the stone doors with a sullen thud closed behind us we did not go far just then phorenice halted in the hall of waiting how well i remembered the place with the pictures of kings on its red walls and the burning fountain of which blazed from a jet of bronze in the middle of the flooring and gave it light the old king that was gone had come this far of his complaisance when he bade me farewell as i set out twenty years before for my in yucatan but the air of the hall was different to what it had been in those old days then it was pure and sweet now it was heavy with some scent and i found it languid and oppressive my minister said the empress i acquit you of intentional insult but i think the colonial air has made you a very simple man such an obeisance as you showed to that mountain not a minute since has not been made since i was sent to reign over this kingdom your majesty i said i am a member of the priests clan and was brought up in their tenets i have been taught before entering a house to thank the gods and more especially our lord the sun for the good air that he and they have provided it has been my fate more than once to be chased by streams of fire and stinking air amongst the mountains during one of their sudden boils and so i can say the prescribed prayer upon this matter straight from my heart circumstances have changed since you left atlantis said phorenice and when thanks are given now they are not thrown at those old gods i saw her meaning and almost started at the impiety of it if this was to be the new rule of things i would have no hand in it fate might deal with me as it chose to serve truly a reigning monarch that i was prepared for but to palter with sacrilege and accept a daughter as a god who should receive prayers and obeisances revolted my manhood so i invited a crisis phorenice i said i have been a priest from my childhood up revering the gods and growing intimate with their mysteries till i find for myself that those old things are false i must stand by that allegiance and if there is a cost for this faithfulness i must pay it she looked at me with a slow smile you are a strong man deucalion she said i bowed i have heard others as stubborn she said but they were converted she shook out the ruddy bunches of her hair and stood so that the light of the burning might fall on the loveliness of her face and form i have found it as easy to convert the stubborn as to burn them indeed there has been little talk of burning they have all rushed to conversion whether i would or no but it seems that my poor looks and tongue are wanting in charm part ii she never even asked who it was amelia reported to her sisters when she had returned to the house because she knew replied sophia sagely there has never been any old friend but that one old friend to come back into eudora life has he come back into her life i wonder said amelia what did he return to wellwood for if he come for that all his relatives are gone he never married yes he has come back to see eudora and marry her if she will have him no man who ever loved eudora would ever get over loving her and he will not be shocked when he sees her she is no more changed than a beautiful old statue he is changed though said amelia i saw him the other day he see me and i would hardly have known him he has grown stout and his hair is gray hair is gray said sophia yes but you can see the gold through gray it just looks as if a shadow was thrown over it it change her harry gray hair does change him if said anna sentimentally eudora thinks hair turned gray for love of her you can trust her or any woman to see the gold through it hair was never gold just an ordinary brown said amelia anyway the lawtons turned gray young she think of that at all said sophia i wonder why eudora always avoided him so years ago said amelia why a girl in a field of daisies stop to pick one which she never forgets said sophia eudora had so many chances and i think her heart was fixed when she was very young at least i think it was fixed so she knew it i wonder said amelia if he will go and call on her amelia privately wished that she lived near enough to know if harry lawton did call she as well as mrs joseph glynn would have enjoyed watching out and knowing something of the village happenings but the lancaster house was situated so far from the road behind its grove of trees that nothing whatever could be seen i doubt if eudora tells if he does call that is not unless something definite happens said anna no remarked amelia sadly eudora is a dear but she is very silent with regard to her own affairs she ought to be said sophia with her married authority she was to her sisters as one who had passed within the shrine and was dignifiedly silent with regard to its intimate mysteries i suppose so assented anna with a soft sigh amelia sighed also then she took the out of the room she had to make some biscuits for supper meantime eudora was pacing homeward with the her serene face was a little perturbed her oval cheeks were flushed and her mouth now and then trembled she had if she followed her usual course to pass the wellwood inn but she could diverge and by taking a side street and walking a farther reach home without coming in sight of the inn she did so when she reached the side street she turned rather swiftly and gave a little sigh of relief she was afraid that she might meet harry lawton it was a lonely way there was a brook on one side bordered thickly with bushy willows which were turning on the other side were undulating on which grazed a few sheep there were no houses until she reached the turn which would lead back to the main street on which her home was located eudora was about midway of this street when she saw a man approaching he was a large man clad in gray and he was swinging an umbrella somehow the swing of that umbrella even from a distance gave an impression of embarrassment and boyish hesitation eudora did not know him at first she had expected to see the same harry lawton who had gone away she did not expect to see a stout man but a slim youth however as they drew nearer each other she knew and curiously enough it was that swing of the tightly furled umbrella which gave her the clue she knew harry because of that it was a little boyish trick which had survived time it was too late for her to draw back for he had seen her and eudora was keenly alive to the indignity of abruptly turning and scuttling away with the tail of her black silk swishing her india shawl trailing and the bumping over the furrows she continued and harry lawton continued and they met harry lawton had known eudora at once she looked the same to him as when she had been a girl and he looked the same to her when he spoke hullo eudora said harry lawton in a ludicrously boyish fashion his face flushed too like a boy he extended his hand like a boy the man seen near at hand was a boy in reality he himself had not changed a few layers of flesh and a change of do not make another man he had always been a simple sincere friendly soul beloved of men and women alike and he was that now eudora held out her hand and her eyes fell before the eyes of the man in an absurd fashion for such a stately creature as she but the man himself acted like a great happy overgrown chapter xxiv tom was a glittering hero once more the pet of the old the envy of the young his name even went into immortal print for the village paper magnified him there were some that believed he would be president yet if he escaped hanging as usual the fickle unreasoning world took muff potter to its bosom and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before but that sort of conduct is to the world's credit therefore it is not well to find fault with it tom's days were days of splendor and exultation to him but his nights were seasons of horror injun joe infested all his dreams and always with doom in his eye hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to stir abroad after nightfall poor huck was in the same state of wretchedness and terror for tom had told the whole story to the lawyer the night before the great day of the trial and huck was sore afraid that his share in the business might leak out yet notwithstanding injun joe's flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court the poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy but what of that since tom's harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the lawyer's house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths huck's confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated daily muff potter's gratitude made tom glad he had spoken but nightly he wished he had sealed up his tongue half the time tom was afraid injun joe would never be captured the other half he was afraid he would be he felt sure he never could draw a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse rewards had been offered the country had been scoured but no injun joe was found one of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels a detective came up from st louis moused around shook his head looked wise and made that sort of astounding success which members of that craft usually achieve that is to say he found a clew but you can't hang a clew for murder and so after that detective had got through and gone home tom felt just as insecure as he was before the slow days drifted on and each left behind it a slightly lightened weight of apprehension chapter xxv there comes a time in every boy's life when he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure this desire suddenly came upon tom one day he sallied out to find joe harper but failed of success next he sought ben rogers he had gone fishing presently he stumbled upon huck finn the huck would answer tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially huck was willing huck was always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is not money where'll we dig said huck oh most anywhere why is it hid all around no indeed it ain't it's hid in mighty particular places huck sometimes on islands sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of an old dead tree just where the shadow falls at midnight but mostly under the floor in ha'nted houses who hides it why robbers of course who'd you reckon sup'rintendents i don't know if twas mine i wouldn't hide it i'd spend it and have a good time so would i but robbers don't

gets rusty and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks a paper that's got to be ciphered over about a week because it's mostly signs and hy'roglyphics hyro which hy'roglyphics pictures and things you know that don't seem to mean anything have you got one of them papers tom no well then how you going to find the marks i don't want any marks they always bury it under a ha'nted house or on an island or under a dead tree that's got one limb sticking out well we've tried jackson's island a little and we can try it again some time and there's the old ha'nted house up the branch and there's lots of trees dead loads of em is it under all of them how you talk no then how you going to know which one to go for go for all of em why tom it'll take all summer

harness pad and load melchisedec the third person in the trio was lottie she was a small thing and did not know what adversity meant and was much bewildered by the alteration she saw in her young adopted mother she had heard it rumored that strange things had happened to sara but she could not understand why she looked different why she wore an old black frock and came into the schoolroom only to teach instead of to sit in her place of honor and learn lessons herself there had been much whispering among the little ones when it had been discovered that sara no longer lived in the rooms in which emily had so long sat in state lottie's chief difficulty was that sara said so little when one asked her questions at seven mysteries must be made very clear if one is to understand them are you very poor now sara she had asked confidentially the first morning her friend took charge of the small french class are you as poor as a beggar she thrust a fat hand into the slim one and opened round tearful eyes i don't want you to be as poor as a beggar she looked as if she was going to cry and sara hurriedly consoled her beggars have nowhere to live she said courageously i have a place to live in where do you live persisted lottie the new girl sleeps in your room and it isn't pretty any more i live in another room said sara is it a nice one inquired lottie i want to go and see it you must not talk said sara miss minchin is looking at us she will be angry with me for letting you whisper she had found out already that she was to be held accountable for everything which was objected to if the children were not attentive if they talked if they were restless it was she who would be reproved but lottie was a determined little person if sara would not tell her where she lived she would find out in some other way she talked to her small companions and hung about the elder girls and listened when they were gossiping and acting upon certain information they had unconsciously let drop she started late one afternoon on a voyage of discovery climbing stairs she had never known the existence of until she reached the attic floor there she found two doors near each other and opening one she saw her beloved sara standing upon an old table and looking out of a window sara she cried aghast mamma sara she was aghast because the attic was so bare and ugly and seemed so far away from all the world her short legs had seemed to have been mounting hundreds of stairs sara turned round at the sound of her voice it was her turn to be aghast what would happen now if lottie began to cry and any one chanced to hear they were both lost she jumped down from her table and ran to the child don't cry and make a noise she implored i shall be scolded if you do and i have been scolded all day it's it's not such a bad room lottie isn't it gasped lottie and as she looked round it she bit her lip she was a spoiled child yet but she was fond enough of her adopted parent to make an effort to control herself for her sake then somehow it was quite possible that any place in which sara lived might turn out to be nice why isn't it sara she almost whispered sara hugged her close and tried to laugh there was a sort of comfort in the warmth of the plump childish body she had had a hard day and had been staring out of the windows with hot eyes you can see all sorts of things you can't see downstairs she said what sort of things demanded lottie with that curiosity sara could always awaken even in bigger girls chimneys quite close to us with smoke curling up in wreaths and clouds and going up into the sky and sparrows hopping about and talking to each other just as if they were people and other attic windows where heads may pop out any minute and you can wonder who they belong to and it all feels as high up as if it was another world oh let me see it cried lottie lift me up sara lifted her up and they stood on the old table together and leaned on the edge of the flat window in the roof and looked out anyone who has not done this does not know what a different world they saw the slates spread out on either side of them and slanted down into the rain the sparrows being at home there twittered and hopped about quite without fear two of them perched on the chimney top nearest and quarrelled with each other fiercely until one pecked the other and drove him away the garret window next to theirs was shut because the house next door was empty i wish someone lived there sara said it is so close that if there was a little girl in the attic we could talk to each other

aftermath of tragedy xvi burke plots xvii outside the law xviii the noiseless death xix within the toils xx who shot griggs xxi aggie at bay xxii the trap that failed xxiii the confession xxiv anguish and bliss chapter i the panel of light the lids of the girl's eyes lifted slowly and she stared at the panel of light in the wall just at the outset the act of seeing made not the least impression on her numbed brain for a long time she continued to regard the dim illumination in the wall with the same passive fixity of gaze apathy still lay upon her crushed spirit in a vague way she realized her own inertness and rested in it gratefully subtly fearful lest she again arouse to the full horror of her plight in a curious subconscious fashion she was striving to hold on to this deadness of sensation thus to win a little respite from the torture that had exhausted her soul of a sudden her eyes noted the black lines that lay across the panel of light and in that instant her spirit was quickened once again the clouds lifted from her brain vision was clear now understanding seized the full import of this hideous thing on which she looked for the panel of light was a window set high within a wall of stone the rigid lines of black that crossed it were bars prison bars it was still true then she was in a cell of the tombs the girl crouching miserably on the narrow bed maintained her fixed watching of the window that window which was a symbol of her utter despair again agony wrenched within her she did not weep long ago she had exhausted the relief of tears she did not pace to and fro in the comfort of physical movement with which the caged beast finds a mocking imitation of liberty long ago her physical vigors had been drained under stress of anguish now she was incapable of any bodily activity there came not even so much as the feeblest moan from her lips the torment was far too racking for such futile fashion of lamentation she merely sat there in a posture of collapse to all outward seeming nerveless emotionless an abject creature even the eyes which held so fixedly their gaze on the window were quite expressionless over them lay a film like that which veils the eyes of some dead thing only an occasional languid motion of the lids revealed the life that remained so still the body within the soul fury raged uncontrolled for all the desolate calm of outer seeming the tragedy of her fate was being acted with frightful vividness there in memory in that dreadful remembrance her spirit was rent asunder anew by realization of that which had become her portion it was then as once again the horrible injustice of her fate racked consciousness with its tortures that the seeds of revolt were implanted in her heart the thought of revenge gave to her the first meager gleam of comfort that had lightened her moods through many miserable days and nights those seeds of revolt were to be nourished well were to grow into their flower a poison flower developed through the three years of convict life to which the judge had sentenced her the girl was appalled by the mercilessness of a destiny that had so outraged right she was wholly innocent of having done any wrong she had struggled through years of privation to keep herself clean and wholesome worthy of those gentlefolk from whom she drew her blood and earnest effort had ended at last under an overwhelming accusation false yet none the less fatal to her this accusation after delays had culminated in conviction the sentence of the court had been imposed upon her that for three years she should be imprisoned this despite her innocence she had endured much miserably much for honesty's sake there wrought the irony of fate she had endured bravely for honesty's sake and the end of it all was shame unutterable there was nought left her save a wild dream of revenge against the world that had martyrized her vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord the admonition could not touch her now why should she care for the decrees of a god who had abandoned her there had been nothing in the life of mary turner before the catastrophe came to distinguish it from many another its most significant details were of a sordid kind familiar to poverty her father had been an unsuccessful man as success is esteemed by this generation of he was a gentleman but the trivial fact is of small avail he was of good birth and he was the possessor of an inherited competence he had as well intelligence but it was not of a financial sort wherein the angel locates a rare tree and dines with the gang from afar freckles saw them coming the angel was standing waving her hat he sprang on his wheel and raced jolting and pounding down the corduroy to meet them the bird woman stopped the horse and the angel gave him the bit of print paper freckles leaned the wheel against a tree and took the proof with eager fingers he never before had seen a study from any of his chickens he stood staring when he turned his face toward them it was transfigured with delight you see he exclaimed and began gazing again oh me little chicken he cried oh me ilegant little chicken i'd be giving all me money in the bank for you then he thought of the angel's muff and mrs duncan's hat and added or at least all but what i'm needing bad for something else would you mind stopping at the cabin a minute and showing this to mother duncan he asked give me that little book in your pocket said the bird woman she folded the outer edges of the proof so that it would fit into the book explaining as she did so its perishable nature in that state freckles went hurrying ahead and they arrived in time to see mrs duncan gazing as if awestruck and to hear her bewildered weel i be drawed on freckles and the angel helped the bird woman to establish herself for a long day at the mouth of sleepy snake creek then she sent them away and waited what luck would bring to her now what shall we do inquired the angel who was a bundle of nerves and energy would you like to go to me room awhile asked freckles if you don't care to very much i'd rather not said the angel i'll tell you let's go help mrs duncan with dinner and play with the baby i love a nice clean baby they started toward the cabin every few minutes they stopped to investigate something or to chatter over some natural history wonder the angel had quick eyes she seemed to see everything but freckles were even quicker for life itself had depended on their sharpness ever since the beginning of his work at the swamp they saw it at the same time someone has been making a flagpole said the angel running the toe of her shoe around the stump evidently made that season freckles what would anyone cut a tree as small as that for i don't know said freckles well but i want to know said the angel no one came away here and cut it for fun they've taken it away let's go back and see if we can see it anywhere around there she turned retraced her footsteps and began eagerly searching freckles did the same there it is he exclaimed at last leaning against the trunk of that big maple yes and leaning there has killed a patch of dried bark said the angel see how dried it appears freckles stared at her angel he shouted i bet you it's a marked tree course it is cried the angel no one would cut that sapling and carry it away there and lean it up for nothing i'll tell you this is one of jack's marked trees he's climbed up there above anyone's head peeled the bark and cut into the grain enough to be sure then he's laid the bark back and fastened it with that pole to mark it you see there're a lot of other big maples close around it can you climb to that place yes said freckles if i take off my i can then take them off said the angel and do hurry can't you see that i am almost crazy to know if this tree is a marked one when they pushed the sapling over a piece of bark as big as the crown of freckles hat fell away i believe it looks kind of nubby encouraged the angel backing away with her face all screwed into a twist in an effort to intensify her vision freckles reached the opening then slid rapidly to the ground he was almost breathless while his eyes were flashing the bark's been cut clean with a knife the sap scraped away and a big chip taken out deep the trunk is the twistiest thing you ever saw it's full of eyes as a bird is of feathers the angel was dancing and shaking his hand oh freckles she cried i'm so delighted that you found it but i didn't said the astonished freckles that tree isn't my find it's yours i forgot it and was going on you wouldn't give up and kept talking about it and turned back you found it you'd best be looking after your reputation for truth and veracity said the angel you know you saw that sapling first yes after you took me back and set me looking for it scoffed freckles the clear ringing echo of strongly swung axes came crashing through the limberlost tis the gang shouted freckles they're clearing a place to make the camp let's go help hadn't we better mark that tree again cautioned the angel it's away in here there's such a lot of them and all so much alike we'd feel good and green to find it and then lose it the god of tarzan among the books of his dead father in the little cabin by the harbor tarzan of the apes found many things to puzzle his young head by much labor and through the medium of infinite patience as well he had without assistance discovered the purpose of the little bugs which ran riot upon the printed pages he had learned that in the many combinations in which he found them they spoke in a silent language spoke in a strange tongue spoke of wonderful things which a little could not by any chance fully understand arousing his curiosity stimulating his imagination and filling his soul with a mighty longing for further knowledge a dictionary had proven itself a wonderful storehouse of information when after several years of tireless endeavor he had solved the mystery of its purpose and the manner of its use he had learned to make a species of game out of it following up the spoor of a new thought through the mazes of the many definitions which each new word required him to consult it was like following a quarry through the jungle it was hunting and tarzan of the apes was an indefatigable huntsman there were of course certain words which aroused his curiosity to a greater extent than others words which for one reason or another excited his imagination there was one for example the meaning of which was rather difficult to grasp it was the word god tarzan first had been attracted to it by the fact that it was very short and that it commenced with a larger than those about it a male it was to tarzan the letters being females another fact which attracted him to this word was the number of which figured in its definition supreme deity creator or upholder of the universe this must be a very important word indeed he would have to look into it and he did though it still baffled him after many months of thought and study however tarzan counted no time wasted which he devoted to these strange hunting expeditions into the game preserves of knowledge for each word and each definition led on and on into strange places into new worlds where with increasing frequency he met old familiar faces and always he added to his store of knowledge but of the meaning of god he was yet in doubt once he thought he had grasped it that god was a mighty chieftain king of all the mangani he was not quite sure however since that would mean that god was mightier than tarzan a point which tarzan of the apes who acknowledged no equal in the jungle was loath to concede but in all the books he had there was no picture of god though he found much to confirm his belief that god was a great an individual he saw pictures of places where god was worshiped but never any sign of god finally he began to wonder if god were not of a different form than he and at last he determined to set out in search of him he commenced by questioning mumga who was very old and had seen many strange things in her long life but mumga being an ape had a faculty for recalling the trivial that time when gunto mistook a for an edible beetle had made more impression upon mumga than all the innumerable manifestations of the greatness of god which she had witnessed and which of course she had not understood numgo overhearing tarzan's questions managed to wrest his attention long enough from the diversion of flea hunting to advance the theory that the power which made the lightning and the rain and the thunder came from goro the moon he knew this he said because the always was danced in the light of goro this reasoning though entirely satisfactory to numgo and mumga failed fully to convince tarzan however it gave him a basis for further investigation along a new line he would investigate the moon that night he clambered to the loftiest pinnacle of the tallest jungle giant the moon was full a great glorious equatorial moon the upright upon a slender swaying limb raised his bronzed face to the silver orb now that he had clambered to the highest point within his reach he discovered to his surprise that goro was as far away as when he viewed him from the ground he thought that goro was attempting to elude him come goro he cried tarzan of the apes will not harm you but still the moon held aloof tell me he continued if you be the great king who sends ara the lightning who makes the great noise and the mighty winds and sends the waters down upon the jungle people when the days are dark and it is cold tell me goro are you god of course he did not pronounce god as you or i would pronounce his name for tarzan knew naught of the spoken language of his english forbears but he had a name of his own invention for each of the little bugs which constituted the alphabet unlike the apes he was not satisfied merely to have a mental picture of the things he knew he must have a word descriptive of each in reading he grasped a word in its entirety but when he spoke the words he had learned from the books of his father he pronounced each according to the names he had given the various little bugs which occurred in it usually giving the gender prefix for each jo's will as allan woodcourt and jo proceed along the streets where the high church spires and the distances are so near and clear in the morning light that the city itself seems renewed by rest allan revolves in his mind how and where he shall bestow his companion it surely is a strange fact he considers that in the heart of a civilized world this creature in human form should be more difficult to dispose of than an unowned dog but it is none the less a fact because of its strangeness and the difficulty remains at first he looks behind him often to assure himself that jo is still really following but look where he will he still beholds him close to the opposite houses making his way with his wary hand from brick to brick and from door to door and often as he creeps along glancing over at him watchfully soon satisfied that the last thing in his thoughts is to give him the slip allan goes on considering with a less divided attention what he shall do a at a suggests the first thing to be done he stops there looks round and beckons jo jo crosses and comes halting and shuffling up slowly scooping the knuckles of his right hand round and round in the hollowed palm of his left kneading dirt with a natural pestle and mortar what is a dainty repast to jo is then set before him and he begins to gulp the coffee and to gnaw the bread and butter looking anxiously about him in all directions as he eats and drinks like a scared animal but he is so sick and miserable that even hunger has abandoned him i thought i was amost sir says jo soon putting down his food but i don't know nothink not even that i don't care for eating wittles nor yet for drinking on em and jo stands shivering and looking at the breakfast wonderingly allan woodcourt lays his hand upon his pulse and on his chest draw breath jo it draws says jo as heavy as a cart he might add and rattles like it but he only mutters i'm on sir allan looks about for an apothecary's shop there is none at hand but a tavern does as well or better he obtains a little measure of wine and gives the lad a portion of it very carefully he begins to revive almost as soon as it passes his lips we may repeat that dose jo observes allan after watching him with his attentive face so now we will take five minutes rest and then go on again leaving the boy sitting on the bench of the with his back against an iron railing allan woodcourt paces up and down in the early sunshine casting an occasional look towards him without appearing to watch him it requires no discernment to perceive that he is warmed and refreshed if a face so shaded can brighten his face brightens somewhat and by little and little he eats the slice of bread he had so hopelessly laid down observant of these signs of improvement allan engages him in conversation and elicits to his no small wonder the adventure of the lady in the veil with all its consequences jo slowly munches as he slowly tells it when he has finished his story and his bread they go on again intending to refer his difficulty in finding a temporary place of refuge for the boy to his old patient zealous little miss flite allan leads the way to the court where he and jo first foregathered but all is changed at the rag and bottle shop miss flite no longer lodges there it is shut up and a female much obscured by dust whose age is a problem but who is indeed no other than the interesting judy is tart and spare in her replies these sufficing however to inform the visitor that miss flite and her birds are domiciled with a mrs blinder in bell yard he repairs to that neighbouring place where miss flite who rises early that she may be punctual at the divan of justice held by her excellent friend the chancellor comes running downstairs with tears of welcome and with open arms my dear physician cries miss flite my meritorious distinguished honourable officer she uses some odd expressions but is as cordial and full of heart as sanity itself can be more so than it often is allan very patient with her waits until she has no more raptures to express then points out jo trembling in a doorway and tells her how he comes there where can i lodge him hereabouts for the present now you have a fund of knowledge and good sense and can advise me miss flite mighty proud of the compliment sets herself to consider but it is long before a bright thought occurs to her mrs blinder is entirely let and she herself occupies poor gridley's room gridley exclaims miss flite clapping her hands after a twentieth repetition of this remark gridley to be sure of course my dear physician general george will help us out it is hopeless to ask for any information about general george and would be though miss flite had not already run upstairs to put on her pinched bonnet and her poor little shawl and to arm herself with her reticule of documents but as she informs her physician in her disjointed manner on coming down in full array that general george whom she often calls upon knows her dear fitz jarndyce and takes a great interest in all connected with her allan is induced to think that they may be in the right way so he tells jo for his encouragement that this walking about will soon be over now and they repair to the general's fortunately it is not far scarsdale new york speedo's pizza was late so scott got the two medium pepperoni pizzas for free tipping the embarrassed delivery boy for his efforts not his fault that his company makes absurd promises and contributes to the accident rate as approached scott's stomach knotted up he wasn't quite sure what he would find when he dialed the canadian

major with a minor in civic administration did not prepare him for the tasks the army had in store for him army intelligence was in desperate need of quality analysts people with minds more than marshmallows for brain the army intelligence division personnel staff poured through new recruit files in hopes of recruiting them into the voluntary program but the catch phrase military intelligence a contradiction in terms made their job doubly difficult so they resorted to other tactics to recruit quali fied people for an unpopular and often despised branch of the military they made deals and they made lt marvin jacobs a deal he couldn't refuse young captain jacobs returned to the united states at the end of the conflict as a highly skilled and experienced communications manager for the

reconnaissance apr for short travel when and where you like ostensibly on behalf of your government if worse comes to worst attend a half day seminar and make yourself seen then there was silence for a time while hubert had been in the trap his father and uncle had been walking along the beach and the former heard for the first time the nature and danger of the smuggler's trap he was at once filled with anxiety about his son and had hurried to the place to call him back when to his horror he found that the tide had already covered the only way by which the dangerous place might be approached no sooner had he heard hubert's answering cry than he rushed forward to try and save him but the next moment a great wave came rolling in and dashed him upon the cliff terribly bruised he clung to the cliff till the surf fell back and then ran on again he slipped over a rock and fell but instantly regaining his feet he advanced further and in his haste fell into a hollow which was filled with water before he could emerge another wave was upon him this one beat him down and it was only by clinging to the seaweed that he escaped being sucked back by the retreating surge bold and frenzied though he was he had to start back from the fury of such an assault as this he rushed backward and waited his eyes searched wildly around he noticed that the surf grew more violent every moment and every moment took away hope but he would not yield once more he rushed forward the waves rolled in but he grasped the rocks and withstood the surf and still advanced another followed he bowed before it and clinging to the rocks as before came forth triumphant already he was nearly halfway he sprang upon a rock that rose above the level of the seething flood and stood for a moment panting and gasping but now a great wave came rolling in upon him he fell on his knees and clung to the seaweed the wave struck it hurled him from the rock he rolled over and over blinded bruised and half drowned he felt himself dashed against the cliff he threw his arms wildly about but found nothing which he could seize the retreating wave sucked him back but a rock stayed him this he grasped and was saved then hastily scrambling to his feet he staggered back to the place from which he had started before he could get back another wave threw him down and this time he might have been drowned had not his brother plunged in and dragged him out of all this hubert had seen nothing and known nothing he waited for some time in silence and then called there was no answer he called again and again but at that time his father was struggling with the waves and did not hear him at last after what seemed an interminable time he heard once more his father's voice he shouted back don't be afraid cried the voice i'll get you out wait and then there were no more voices it was about two o'clock when hubert had entered the gorge it was after three when his father had roused him and made his vain effort to save him hubert was now left alone with the rising tide whose waters rolled forward with fearful rapidity the beach inside was nearly level and he saw that in an hour or so it would be covered with the waters he tried to trust to his father's promise but the precious moments passed and he began to look with terror upon the increasing storm for every moment the wind grew fiercer and the surf rolled in with ever increasing impetuosity he looked all around for a place of refuge and saw nothing except the rock which arose at the extremity of the place at the foot of the overhanging cliffs it was about five feet high and was the only place that afforded anything like safety up this he clambered and from this he could survey the scene but only to perceive the full extent of his danger for the tide rushed in more and more swiftly the surf grew higher and higher and he saw plainly that before long the water would reach the summit of the rock and that even before then the surf in its violence would sweep him away the moments passed slowly minutes seemed in his suspense to be transformed to hours the sky was overspread now with black clouds and the gloom increased at length the waves rolled in until they covered all the beach in front and began to dash against the rock on which he had taken refuge the precious moments passed higher and higher grew the waters they came rolling into the cave urged on by the fury of the billows outside and heaping themselves up as they were compressed into this narrow gorge they dashed up around the rock the spray was tossed in his face already he felt their inexorable grasp death seemed so near that hope left him he fell upon his knees with his hands clasped and his white face upturned just then a great wave rolled up and flung itself over the rock and over his knees as he knelt and over his hands as he clasped them in prayer a few more moments and all would be over vii during the ensuing weeks mr ramy though his visits were as frequent as ever did not seem to regain his usual spirits he complained frequently of headache but rejected ann eliza's tentatively proffered remedies and seemed to shrink

wouldn't give a night like this for a breath of real country air so would i said mr ramy knocking the ashes from his pipe i'd like to be setting in an arbour dis very minute oh wouldn't it be lovely i always think it's real cool here we'd be heaps hotter up where miss mellins is said ann eliza oh i daresay but we'd be heaps cooler somewhere else her sister snapped she was not infrequently exasperated by ann eliza's furtive attempts to mollify providence a few days later mr ramy appeared with a suggestion which enchanted evelina he had gone the day before to see his friend mrs hochmuller who lived in the outskirts of hoboken and mrs hochmuller had proposed that on the following sunday he should bring the bunner sisters to spend the day with her she's got a real garden you know mr ramy explained wid trees and a real to set in and hens and chickens too and it's an elegant sail over on de the proposal drew no response from ann eliza she was still oppressed by the recollection of her interminable sunday in the park but obedient to evelina's imperious glance she finally faltered out an acceptance the sunday was a very hot one and once on the ann eliza revived at the touch of the salt breeze and the spectacle of the crowded waters but when they reached the other shore and stepped out on the dirty wharf she began to ache with anticipated weariness they got into a and were jolted from one mean street to another till at length mr ramy pulled the conductor's sleeve and they got out again then they stood in the blazing sun near the door of a crowded waiting for another car to come and that carried them out to a thinly settled district past vacant lots and narrow brick houses standing in unsupported solitude till they finally reached an almost rural region of scattered cottages and low wooden buildings that looked like village stores here the car finally stopped of its own accord and they walked along a rutty road past a yard with a high fence tapestried with theatrical advertisements to a little red house with green blinds and a garden paling really mr ramy had not deceived them clumps of dielytra and bloomed behind the paling and a crooked elm hung romantically over the gable of the house at the gate mrs hochmuller a broad woman in merino met them with nods and smiles while her daughter linda a girl with mottled red cheeks and a sidelong stare hovered inquisitively behind her mrs hochmuller leading the way into the house conducted the bunner sisters the way to her bedroom here they were invited to spread out on a mountainous white featherbed the cashmere mantles under which the solemnity of the occasion had compelled them to swelter and when they had given their black silks the necessary twitch of readjustment and evelina had fluffed out her hair before a framed in work their hostess led them to a stuffy parlour smelling of gingerbread after another ceremonial pause broken by polite enquiries and shy ejaculations they were shown into the kitchen where the table was already spread with and stewed fruits and where they presently found themselves seated between mrs hochmuller and mr ramy while the staring linda bumped back and forth from the stove with steaming dishes to ann eliza the dinner seemed endless and the rich fare strangely unappetizing she was abashed by the easy intimacy of her hostess's voice and eye with mr ramy mrs hochmuller was almost flippantly familiar and it was only when ann eliza pictured her generous form bent above his that she could forgive her for tersely addressing him as ramy during one of the pauses of the meal mrs hochmuller laid her knife and fork against the edges of her plate and fixing her eyes on the face said accusingly you hat one of dem turns again ramy i dunno as i had he returned evasively evelina glanced from one to the other mr ramy has been sick she said at length as though to show that she also was in a position to speak with authority he's complained very frequently of headaches ho i know him said mrs hochmuller with a laugh her eyes still on the ain't you ashamed of yourself ramy mr ramy who was looking at his plate said suddenly one word which the sisters could not understand it sounded to ann eliza like shwike mrs hochmuller laughed again my my she said wouldn't you think he'd be ashamed to go and be sick and never dell me me that nursed him troo dat awful fever i looked at the man awhile in solid astonishment then i says now i hope you take it as an offence for i mean any but really for a man that has been in the kingdom as long as i reckon you have you do seem to know powerful little about its customs its customs says he heaven is a large place good friend large empires have many and diverse customs even small dominions have as you doubtless know by what you have seen of the matter on a small scale in the wart how can you imagine i could ever learn the varied customs of the countless kingdoms of heaven it makes my head ache to think of it i know the customs that prevail in those portions inhabited by peoples that are appointed to enter by my own gate and hark ye that is quite enough knowledge for one individual to try to pack into his head in the millions of years i have devoted night and day to that study but the idea of learning the customs of the whole appalling expanse of heaven o man how insanely you talk now i doubt that this odd costume you talk about is the fashion in that district of heaven you belong to but you be conspicuous in this section without it i felt all right if that was the case so i bade him and left all day i walked towards the far end of a prodigious hall of the office hoping to come out into heaven any moment but it was a mistake that hall was built on the general heavenly plan it naturally be small at last i got so tired i go any farther so i sat down to rest and begun to tackle the queerest sort of strangers and ask for information but i get any they understand my language and i could not understand theirs i got dreadfully lonesome i was so and homesick i wished a hundred times i never had died i turned back of course about noon next day i got back at last and was on hand at the once more says i to the head clerk i begin to see that a got to be in his own heaven to be happy perfectly correct says he did you imagine the same heaven would suit all sorts of men well i had that idea but i see the foolishness of it which way am i to go to get to my district he called the under clerk that had examined the map and he gave me general directions i thanked him and started but he says wait a minute it is millions of leagues from here go outside and stand on that red shut your eyes hold your breath and wish yourself there much obliged says i why you dart me through when i first arrived we have a good deal to think of here it was your place to think of it and ask for it we probably see you in this region for a thousand centuries or so in that case o revoor says i i hopped onto the carpet and held my breath and shut my eyes and wished i was in the of my own section the very next instant a voice i knew sung out in a business kind of a way a harp and a pair of wings and a halo size for eli stormfield of san francisco make him out a clean bill of health and let him in i opened my eyes sure enough it was a pi ute injun i used to know in tulare county mighty good fellow i remembered being at his funeral which consisted of him being burnt and the other injuns gauming their faces with his ashes and howling like wildcats he was powerful glad to see me and you may make up your mind i was just as glad to see him and feel that i was in the right kind of a heaven at last just as far as your eye could reach there was swarms of clerks running and bustling around tricking out thousands of yanks and mexicans and english and arabs and all sorts of people in their new outfits and when they gave me my kit and i put on my halo and took a look in the glass i could have jumped over a house for joy i was so happy now this is something like says i now says i all right show me a cloud inside of fifteen minutes i was a mile on my way towards the and about a million people along with me most of us tried to fly but some got crippled and nobody made a success of it so we concluded to walk for the present till we had had some wing practice we begun to meet swarms of folks who were coming back some had harps and nothing else some had and nothing else some had nothing at all all of them looked meek and uncomfortable one young fellow anything left but his halo and he was carrying that in his hand all of a sudden he offered it to me and says chapter madame haupt hebamme ran a sign swinging from a window over a saloon on the avenue at a side door was another sign with a hand pointing up a dingy flight of stairs jurgis went up them three at a time madame haupt was frying pork and onions and had her door half open to let out the smoke when he tried to knock upon it it swung open the rest of the way and he had a glimpse of her with a black bottle turned up to her lips then he knocked louder and she started and put it away she was a dutchwoman enormously fat when she walked she rolled like a small boat on the ocean and the dishes in the cupboard jostled each other she wore a filthy blue wrapper and her teeth were black vot is it she said when she saw jurgis he had run like mad all the way and was so out of breath he could hardly speak his hair was flying and his eyes wild he looked like a man that had risen from the tomb my wife he panted come quickly madame haupt set the frying pan to one side and wiped her hands on her wrapper you vant me to come for a case she inquired yes gasped jurgis i haf yust come back from a

trouble and my money is gone but i'll pay you every cent just as soon as i can i can work vot is your work i have no place now i must get one but i how much haf you got now he could hardly bring himself to reply when he said a dollar and a quarter the woman laughed in his face i vould not put on my hat for a dollar and a quarter she said it's all i've got he pleaded his voice breaking i must get some one my wife will die i can't help it i madame haupt had put back her pork and onions on the stove she turned to him and answered out of the steam and noise git me ten dollars cash und so you

she said in a melancholy voice i might as vell go mit you for noffing as vot you offer me but i vill try to help you how far is it the old tale about the queer client it matters little said the old man where or how i picked up this brief history if i were to relate it in the order in which it reached me i should commence in the middle and when i had arrived at the conclusion go back for a beginning it is enough for me to say that some of its circumstances passed before my own eyes for the remainder i know them to have happened and there are some persons yet living who will remember them but too well in the borough high street near st church and on the same side of the way stands as most people know the smallest of our debtors prisons the marshalsea although in later times it has been a very different place from the sink of filth and dirt it once was even its improved condition holds out but little temptation to the extravagant or consolation to the improvident the condemned felon has as good a yard for air and exercise in newgate as the insolvent debtor in the marshalsea prison better but this is past in a better age and the prison exists no longer it may be my fancy or it may be that i cannot separate the place from the old recollections associated with it but this part of london i cannot bear the street is broad the shops are spacious the noise of passing vehicles the footsteps of a perpetual stream of people all the busy sounds of traffic resound in it from morn to midnight but the streets around are mean and close poverty and debauchery lie festering in the crowded alleys want and misfortune are pent up in the narrow prison an air of gloom and dreariness seems in my eyes at least to hang about the scene and to impart to it a squalid and sickly hue many eyes that have long since been closed in the grave have looked round upon that scene lightly enough when entering the gate of the old marshalsea prison for the first time for despair seldom comes with the first severe shock of misfortune a man has confidence in untried friends he remembers the many offers of service so freely made by his boon companions when he wanted them not he has hope the hope of happy inexperience and however he may bend beneath the first shock it springs up in his bosom and flourishes there for a brief space until it droops beneath the blight of disappointment and neglect how soon have those same eyes deeply sunken in the head glared from faces wasted with famine and sallow from confinement in days when it was no figure of speech to say that debtors rotted in prison with no hope of release and no prospect of liberty the atrocity in its full extent no longer exists but there is enough of it left to give rise to occurrences that make the heart bleed twenty years ago that pavement was worn with the footsteps of a mother and child who day by day so surely as the morning came presented themselves at the prison gate often after a night of restless misery and anxious thoughts were they there a full hour too soon and then the young mother turning meekly away would lead the child to the old bridge and raising him in her arms to show him the glistening water tinted with the light of the sun and stirring with all the bustling preparations for business and pleasure that the river presented at that early hour endeavour to interest his thoughts in the objects before him but she would quickly set him down and hiding her face in her shawl give vent to the tears that blinded her for no expression of interest or amusement lighted up his thin and sickly face his recollections were few enough but they were all of one kind all connected with the poverty and misery of his parents hour after hour had he sat on his knee and with childish sympathy watched the tears that stole down her face and then crept quietly away into some dark corner and sobbed himself to sleep the hard realities of the world with many of its worst privations hunger and thirst and cold and want had all come home to him from the first dawnings of reason and though the form of childhood was there its light heart its merry laugh and sparkling eyes were wanting the father and mother looked on upon this and upon each other with thoughts of agony they dared not breathe in words the healthy strong made man who could have borne almost any fatigue of active exertion was wasting beneath the close confinement and unhealthy atmosphere of a crowded prison the slight and delicate woman was sinking beneath the combined effects of bodily and mental illness the young heart was breaking winter came and with it weeks of cold and heavy rain the poor girl had removed to a wretched apartment close to the spot of her imprisonment and though the change had been rendered necessary by their increasing poverty she was happier now for she was nearer him for two months she and her little companion watched the opening of the gate as usual one day she failed to come for the first time another morning arrived and she came alone the child was dead chapter iii chirp the third the dutch clock in the corner struck ten when the carrier sat down by his fireside so troubled and that he seemed to scare the cuckoo who having cut his ten melodious announcements as short as possible plunged back into the moorish palace again and clapped his little door behind him as if the unwonted spectacle were too much for his feelings if the little haymaker had been armed with the sharpest of scythes and had cut at every stroke into the heart he never could have gashed and wounded it as dot had done it was a heart so full of love for her so bound up and held together by innumerable threads of winning remembrance spun from the daily working of her many qualities of endearment it was a heart in which she had enshrined herself so gently and so closely a heart so single and so earnest in its truth so strong in right so weak in wrong that it could cherish neither passion nor revenge at first and had only room to hold the broken image of its idol but slowly slowly as the carrier sat brooding on his hearth now cold and dark other and fiercer thoughts began to rise within him as an angry wind comes rising in the night the stranger was beneath his outraged roof three steps would take him to his one blow would beat it in you might do murder before you know it tackleton had said how could it be murder if he gave the villain time to grapple with him hand to hand he was the younger man it was an thought bad for the dark mood of his mind it was an angry thought goading him to some avenging act that should change the cheerful house into a haunted place which lonely travellers would dread to pass by night and where the timid would see shadows struggling in the ruined windows when the moon was dim and hear wild noises in the stormy weather he was the younger man yes yes some lover who had won the heart that he had never touched some lover of her early choice of whom she had thought and dreamed for whom she had pined and pined when he had fancied her so happy by his side o agony to think of it she had been with the baby getting it to bed as he sat brooding on the hearth she came close beside him without his knowledge in the turning of the rack of his great misery he lost all other sounds and put her little stool at his feet he only knew it when he felt her hand upon his own and saw her looking up into his face with wonder no it was his first impression and he was fain to look at her again to set it right no not with wonder with an eager and inquiring look but not with wonder at first it was alarmed and serious then it changed into a strange wild dreadful smile of recognition of his thoughts then there was nothing but her clasped hands on her brow and her bent head and falling hair though the power of omnipotence had been his to wield at that moment he had too much of its diviner property of mercy in his breast to have turned one weight of it against her but he could not bear to see her crouching down upon the little seat where he had often looked on her with love and pride so innocent and gay and when she rose and left him sobbing as she went he felt it a relief to have the vacant place beside him rather than her so presence this in itself was anguish keener than all reminding him how desolate he was become and how the great bond of his life was rent asunder the more he felt this and the more he knew he could have better borne to see her lying prematurely dead before him with their little child upon her breast the higher and the stronger rose his wrath against his enemy he looked about him for a weapon there was a gun hanging on the wall he took it down and moved a pace or two towards the door of the perfidious room he knew the gun was loaded some shadowy idea that it was just to shoot this man like a wild beast seized him and dilated in his mind until it grew into a monstrous demon in complete possession of him casting out all milder thoughts and setting up its undivided empire that phrase is wrong not casting out his milder thoughts but artfully transforming them changing them into scourges to drive him on turning water into blood love into hate gentleness into blind ferocity her image sorrowing humbled but still pleading to his tenderness and mercy with resistless power never left his mind but staying there it urged him to the door raised the weapon to his shoulder fitted and nerved his finger to the trigger and cried kill him in his bed he reversed the gun to beat the stock upon the door he already held it lifted in the air some indistinct design was in his thoughts of calling out to him to fly for sake by the window the man who believed in miracles once upon a time a traveler arrived in a land quite like our own full of modern technology like cars and computers and whistling teapots but with these two differences there were no television sets and no airplanes in fact nothing at all had ever been seen in the sky not even a bird and the only movies the people ever saw were in the theaters the traveler stayed for about a month on the eastern shore where he had arrived and then decided to visit the western cities he mentioned his decision one evening at a meeting of the principal scientists and educators of the region who had gathered to hear of his travels someone mentioned that the west had much to offer but that the journey between the two areas was unpleasant consisting of crossing a hot empty desert in that case said the traveler i'll just fly is that like sleep one of the scientists asked no no the traveler replied you know fly through the air like a bird and what is a bird someone asked and so the traveler began to explain about flight and what an airplane was and how it flew from one place to another the room became very quiet and the expressions on the faces of everyone present darkened does he expect us to believe this one man whispered to another well you know what liars travelers are someone else added finally the host spoke up slightly embarrassed and slightly indignant if this is your idea of a joke he began but was interrupted by the surprised traveler why it's no joke at all people fly all the time i am sorry that you so much underestimate the intelligence and learning of your audience said a professor across the table that a person could enter some metal device like a car with fins and rise into the air and be sustained there and move forward why that clearly violates everything we know about the law of gravity and the laws of physics if we have learned anything from a thousand years of study of the natural world it is that an object heavier than air must return immediately to earth when it is tossed into the sky hear hear two or three people muttered now if you perhaps mean that these airplanes as you call them are somehow flung into the air for a short distance and then fall to the ground well then perhaps that would be possible the professor looked expectantly and a bit condescendingly at the traveler hoping that the man would take this opportunity no no you don't understand said the traveler the airplanes have powerful motors and the craft rise into the air and they stay up as long as they want as long as the fuel holds out there were several audible hmmphs around the room tell us then said another scholar in a saccharine voice how this device works what makes it fly well i don't know exactly how it works it has something to do with air flowing over the wings you don't know you cannot explain how it works this device that runs counter to everything we know about the natural world yet you believe in it anyway believe in it asked the traveler a bit confused by this turn of phrase of course i believe in it i fly on one all the time at home and how do you control its motions a man asked without removing his pipe the audience was clearly beginning to patronize the traveler and he was growing a little irritated oh i don't control it there's a pilot for that i see the pipe smoker said so this airplane contains both you and the pilot you're telling us that perhaps four or five hundred pounds of dead weight can travel through the air as long as it wants as long as the fuel holds out added one of the hmmphers with amusement and all the time sneering at the law of gravity and laughing science in the face someone else noted well actually the planes are much larger than that said the traveler many of them hold two or three hundred people and weigh my i don't know many thousands of pounds i think we have heard enough the and host said it was amusing for awhile but it's time to put an end to this nonsense it is not nonsense the traveler protested it is the truth then you really believe this madman's drivel you've been feeding us the host asked rather hotly of course how can i not believe it i see it and live it every day and here he added remembering something i even have a photograph obviously faked said the host dismissing it after a glance who invited this charlatan someone asked of no one in particular i thought science had put an end to all this miraculous event stuff long ago said another man rising from his chair and preparing to leave well let's not pursue this pointless discussion the host said our guest apparently knows nothing of science and is impervious to logic and to the considered opinion of the best minds of our nation there's nothing left to do but adjourn the meeting began to break up and the traveler was putting on his coat when the man with the pipe made one last attempt to reason with him iv the next morning angelique amedee's wife was in the kitchen baking pies assisted by old mrs chevalier between the and the stove stood the old cradle that had been amedee's and in it was his son as angelique flushed and excited with flour on her hands stopped to smile at the baby emil bergson rode up to the kitchen door on his mare and dismounted medee is out in the field emil angelique called as she ran across the kitchen to the oven he begins to cut his wheat the first wheat ready to cut anywhere about here he bought a new header you know because all the wheat's so short this year i hope he can rent it to the neighbors it cost so much he and his cousins bought a steam thresher on shares you ought to go out and see that header work i watched it an hour this morning busy as i am with all the men to feed he has a lot of hands but he's the only one that knows how to drive the header or how to run the engine so he has to be everywhere at once he's sick too and ought to be in his bed emil bent over hector baptiste trying to make him blink his round black eyes sick what's the matter with your daddy kid been making him walk the floor with you angelique sniffed not much we don't have that kind of babies it was his father that kept baptiste awake all night i had to be getting up and making mustard plasters to put on his stomach he had an awful colic he said he felt better this morning but i don't think he ought to be out in the field overheating himself angelique did not speak with much anxiety not because she was indifferent but because she felt so secure in their good fortune only good things could happen to a rich energetic handsome young man like amedee with a new baby in the cradle and a new header in the field emil stroked the black fuzz on baptiste's head i say angelique one of medee's grandmothers way back must have been a squaw this kid looks exactly like the indian babies angelique made a face at him but old mrs chevalier had been touched on a sore point and she let out such a stream of fiery patois that emil fled from the kitchen and mounted his mare opening the pasture gate from the saddle emil rode across the field to the clearing where the thresher stood driven by a stationary engine and fed from the header boxes as amedee was not on the engine emil rode on to the wheatfield where he recognized on the header the slight wiry figure of his friend coatless his white shirt puffed out by the wind his straw hat stuck jauntily on the side of his head the six big that drew or rather pushed the header went abreast at a rapid walk and as they were still green at the work they required a good deal of management on amedee's part especially when they turned the corners where they divided three and three and then swung round into line again with a movement that looked as complicated as a wheel of artillery emil felt a new thrill of admiration for his friend and with it the old pang of envy at the way in which amedee could do with his might what his hand found to do and feel that whatever it was it was the most important thing in the world i'll have to bring alexandra up to see this thing work emil thought it's splendid when he saw emil amedee waved to him and called to one of his twenty cousins to take the reins stepping off the header without stopping it he ran up to emil who had dismounted come along he called i have to go over to the engine for a minute i gotta green man running it and i gotta to keep an eye on him emil thought the lad was unnaturally flushed and more excited than even the cares of managing a big farm at a critical time warranted as they passed behind a last year's stack amedee clutched at his right side and sank down for a moment on the straw ouch i got an awful pain in me emil something's the matter with my insides for sure emil felt his fiery cheek you ought to go straight to bed medee and telephone for the doctor that's what you ought to do amedee staggered up with a gesture of despair how can i i got no time to be sick three thousand dollars worth of new machinery to manage and the wheat so ripe it will begin to shatter next week my wheat's short but it's gotta grand full berries what's he slowing down for we haven't got header boxes enough to feed the thresher i guess amedee started across the stubble leaning a little to the right as he ran and waved to the engineer not to stop the engine emil saw that this was no time to talk about his own affairs he mounted his mare and rode on to to bid his friends there he went first to see raoul marcel and found him innocently practising the gloria for the big confirmation service on sunday while he polished the mirrors of his father's saloon chapter the child was closely followed by an elderly man of remarkably hard features and forbidding aspect and so low in stature as to be quite a dwarf though his head and face were large enough for the body of a giant his black eyes were restless sly and cunning his mouth and chin bristly with the stubble of a coarse hard beard and his complexion was one of that kind which never looks clean or wholesome but what added most to the grotesque expression of his face was a ghastly smile which appearing to be the mere result of habit and to have no connection with any mirthful or complacent feeling constantly revealed the few discoloured fangs that were yet scattered in his mouth and gave him the aspect of a panting dog his dress consisted of a large hat a worn dark suit a pair of capacious shoes and a dirty white neckerchief sufficiently limp and crumpled to disclose the greater portion of his wiry throat such hair as he had was of a grizzled black cut short and straight upon his temples and hanging in a frowzy fringe about his ears his hands which were of a rough coarse grain were very dirty his fingernails were crooked long and yellow there was ample time to note these particulars for besides that they were sufficiently obvious without very close observation some moments elapsed before any one broke silence the child advanced timidly towards her brother and put her hand in his the dwarf if we may call him so glanced keenly at all present and the who plainly had not expected his uncouth visitor seemed disconcerted and embarrassed ah said the dwarf who with his hand stretched out above his eyes had been surveying the young man attentively that should be your grandson neighbour say rather that he should not be replied the old man but he is and that said the dwarf pointing to dick swiveller some friend of his as welcome here as he said the old man and that inquired the dwarf wheeling round and pointing straight at me a gentleman who was so good as to bring nell home the other night when she lost her way coming from your house the little man turned to the child as if to chide her or express his wonder but as she was talking to the young man held his peace and bent his head to listen well nelly said the young fellow aloud do they teach you to hate me eh no no for shame oh no cried the child to love me perhaps pursued her brother with a sneer to do neither she returned they never speak to me about you indeed they never do i dare be bound for that he said darting a bitter look at the grandfather i dare be bound for that nell oh i believe you there but i love you dearly fred said the child no doubt i do indeed and always will the child repeated with great emotion but oh if you would leave off vexing him and making him unhappy then i could love you more i see said the young man as he stooped carelessly over the child and having kissed her pushed her from him there get you away now you have said your lesson you whimper we part good friends enough if the matter he remained silent following her with his eyes until she had gained her little room and closed the door and then turning to the dwarf said abruptly harkee mr meaning me returned the dwarf quilp is my name you might remember not a long one daniel quilp harkee mr quilp then pursued the other you have some influence with my grandfather there some said mr quilp emphatically and are in a few of his mysteries and secrets a few replied quilp with equal dryness then let me tell him once for all through you that i will come into and go out of this place as often as i like so long as he keeps nell here and that if he wants to be quit of me he must first be quit of her what have i done to be made a bugbear of and to be shunned and dreaded as if i brought the plague tell you that i have no natural affection and that i care no more for nell for her own sake than i do for him let him say so i care for the whim then of coming to and fro and reminding her of my existence i will see her when i please my point i came here to maintain it and come here again fifty times with the same object and always with the same success i said i would stop till i had gained it i have done so and now my ended come dick stop cried mr swiveller as his companion turned toward the door sir sir i am your humble servant said mr quilp to whom the monosyllable was addressed before i leave the gay and festive scene and halls of dazzling light sir said mr swiveller i will with your permission attempt a slight remark i came here sir this day under the impression that the old min was friendly chapter two for the next almayer who wanted to give joanna plenty of time stumbled amongst the lumber in distant parts of his enclosure sneaked along the fences or held his breath flattened against grass walls behind various outhouses all this to escape inconveniently zealous search for his master he heard him talk with the head watchman sometimes quite close to him in the darkness then moving off coming back wondering and as the time passed growing uneasy he did not fall into the river say thou blind watcher ali was growling in a bullying tone to the other man he told me to fetch mahmat and when i came back swiftly i found him not in the house there is that sirani woman there so that mahmat cannot steal anything but it is in my mind the night will be half gone before i rest he shouted master o master o mast what are you making that noise for said almayer with severity stepping out close to them the two malays leaped away from each other in their surprise you may go i want you any more tonight ali went on almayer is mahmat there unless the savage got tired of waiting those men know not politeness they should not be spoken to by white men said ali resentfully almayer went towards the house leaving his servants to wonder where he had sprung from so unexpectedly the watchman hinted obscurely at powers of invisibility possessed by the master who often at night ali interrupted him with great scorn not every white man has the power now the rajah laut could make himself invisible also he could be in two places at once as everybody knew except he the useless watchman who knew no more about white men than a wild pig and ali strolled towards his hut yawning loudly as almayer ascended the steps he heard the noise of a door flung to and when he entered the verandah he saw only mahmat there close to the doorway of the passage mahmat seemed to be caught in the very act of slinking away and almayer noticed that with satisfaction seeing the white man the malay gave up his attempt and leaned against the wall he was a short thick man with very dark skin and a wide stained mouth that uncovered when he spoke a close row of black and glistening teeth his eyes were big prominent dreamy and restless he said sulkily looking all over the place from under his eyebrows white tuan you are great and strong and i a poor man tell me what is your will and let me go in the name of god it is late almayer examined the man thoughtfully how could he find out whether he had it lately he had employed that man and his two brothers as extra boatmen to carry stores provisions and new axes to a camp of rattan cutters some distance up the river a three days expedition he would test him now in that way he said negligently i want you to start at once for the camp with surat for the kavitan one dollar a day the man appeared plunged in dull hesitation but almayer who knew his malays felt pretty sure from his aspect that nothing would induce the fellow to go he urged it is important and if you are swift i shall give two dollars for the last day no tuan we do not go said the man in a hoarse whisper why we start on another journey where to a place we know of said mahmat a little louder in a stubborn manner and looking at the floor almayer experienced a feeling of immense joy he said with affected annoyance you men live in my house and it is as if it were your own i may want my house soon mahmat looked up we are men of the sea and care not for a roof when we have a canoe that will hold three and a paddle apiece the sea is our house peace be with you tuan he turned and went away rapidly and almayer heard him directly afterwards in the courtyard calling to the watchman to open the gate mahmat passed through the gate in silence but before the bar had been put up behind him he had made up his mind that if the white man ever wanted to eject him from his hut he would burn it and also as many of the white other buildings as he could safely get at and he began to call his brothers before he was inside the dilapidated dwelling well muttered almayer to himself taking some loose java tobacco from a drawer in the table now if anything comes out i am clear i asked the man to go up the river i urged him he will say so himself good he began to charge the china bowl of his pipe a pipe with a long cherry stem and a curved mouthpiece pressing the tobacco down with his thumb and thinking no i see her again want to i will give her a good start then go in chase and send an express boat after father yes it the battle of ludlow street rarely was a more genuine tribute paid to entrancing girlhood than when aubrey compelled himself by sheer force of will and the ticking of his subconscious to wake at six o'clock the next morning for this young man took sleep seriously and with a primitive zest it was to him almost a religious function as a minor poet has said he made sleep a career but he did not know what train roger might be taking and he was determined not to miss him by a quarter after six he was seated in the milwaukee lunch which is never closed open from now till the judgment day tables for ladies as its sign says with a cup of coffee and corned beef hash in the mood of tender melancholy common to unaccustomed early rising he dwelt fondly on the thought of titania so near and yet so far away he had leisure to give free rein to these musings for it was ten past seven before roger appeared hurrying toward the subway aubrey followed at a discreet distance taking care not to be observed the bookseller and his pursuer both boarded the eight o'clock train at the pennsylvania station but in very different moods to roger this expedition was a frolic pure and simple he had been tied down to the bookshop so long that a day's excursion seemed too good to be true he bought two cigars an unusual luxury and let the morning paper lie unheeded in his lap as the train drummed over the hackensack marshes he felt a good deal of pride in having been summoned to appraise the oldham library mr oldham was a very distinguished collector a wealthy philadelphia merchant whose choice johnson lamb keats and blake items were the envy of connoisseurs all over the world roger knew very well that there were many dealers who would have jumped at the chance to examine the collection and pocket the appraiser's fee the word that roger had had by long distance telephone was that mr oldham had decided to sell his collection and before putting it to auction desired the advices of an expert as to the prices his items should command in the present state of the market and as roger was not particularly conversant with current events in the world of rare books and manuscripts he spent most of the trip in turning over some annotated catalogues of recent sales which mr chapman had lent him this invitation he said to himself confirms what i have always said that the artist in any line of work will eventually be recognized above the mere tradesman somehow or other mr oldham has heard that i am not only a seller of old books but a lover of them he prefers to have me go over his treasures with him rather than one of those who peddle these things like so much tallow aubrey's humour was far removed from that of the happy bookseller in the first place roger was sitting in the smoker and as aubrey feared to enter the same car for fear of being observed he had to do without his pipe he took the foremost seat in the second coach and peering occasionally through the glass doors he could see the bald poll of his quarry wreathed with exhalements of cheap havana secondly he had hoped to see weintraub on the same train but though he had tarried at the until the last moment the german had not appeared he had concluded from weintraub's words the night before that druggist and bookseller were bound on a joint errand apparently he was mistaken he bit his nails glowered at the flying landscape and revolved many grievous fancies in his prickling bosom among other discontents was the knowledge that he did not have enough money with him to pay his fare back to new york and he would either have to borrow from someone in philadelphia or wire to his office for funds he had not anticipated when setting out upon this series of adventures that it would prove so costly the train drew into broad street station at ten o'clock and aubrey followed the bookseller through the bustling terminus and round the city hall plaza mifflin seemed to know his way but philadelphia was comparatively strange to the solicitor he was quite surprised at the impressive vista of south broad street and chagrined to find people jostling him on the crowded pavement as though they did not know he had just come from new york roger turned in at a huge office building on broad street and took an express elevator aubrey did not dare follow him into the car so he waited in the lobby he learned from the starter that there was a second tier of elevators on the other side of the building so he tipped a boy a quarter to watch them for him describing mifflin so accurately that he could not be missed by this time aubrey was in a thoroughly ill temper and enjoyed quarrelling with the starter on the subject of indicators for showing the position of the elevators observing that in this building the indicators were glass tubes in which the movement of the car was traced by a rising or falling column of coloured fluid aubrey remarked testily that that stunt had long been abandoned in new york the starter retorted that new york was only two hours away if he liked it better this argument helped to fleet the time rapidly old esther dudley our host having resumed the chair he as well as mr tiffany and myself expressed much eagerness to be made acquainted with the story to which the loyalist had alluded that venerable man first of all saw fit to moisten his throat with another glass of wine and then turning his face towards our coal fire looked steadfastly for a few moments into the depths of its cheerful glow finally he poured forth a great fluency of speech the generous liquid that he had imbibed while it warmed his blood likewise took off the chill from his heart and mind and gave him an energy to think and feel which we could hardly have expected to find beneath the snows of fourscore winters his feelings indeed appeared to me more excitable than those of a younger man or at least the same degree of feeling manifested itself by more visible effects than if his judgment and will had possessed the potency of meridian life at the pathetic passages of his narrative he readily melted into tears when a breath of indignation swept across his spirit the blood flushed his withered visage even to the roots of his white hair and he shook his clinched fist at the trio of peaceful auditors seeming to fancy enemies in those who felt very kindly towards the desolate old soul but ever and anon sometimes in the midst of his most earnest talk this ancient person's intellect would wander vaguely losing its hold of the matter in hand and groping for it amid misty shadows then would he cackle forth a feeble laugh and express a doubt whether his wits for by that phrase it pleased our ancient friend to signify his mental powers were not getting a little the worse for wear under these disadvantages the old loyalist's story required more revision to render it fit for the public eye than those of the series which have preceded it nor should it be concealed that the sentiment and tone of the affair may have undergone some slight or perchance more than slight metamorphosis in its transmission to the reader through the medium of a democrat the tale itself is a mere sketch with no involution of plot nor any great interest of events yet possessing if i have rehearsed it aright that pensive influence over the mind which the shadow of the old province house flings upon the loiterer in its the hour had come the hour of defeat and humiliation when sir william howe was to pass over the threshold of the province house and embark with no such triumphal ceremonies as he once promised himself on board the british fleet he bade his servants and military attendants go before him and lingered a moment in the loneliness of the mansion to quell the fierce emotions that struggled in his bosom as with a death throb preferable then would he have deemed his fate had a warrior's death left him a claim to the narrow territory of a grave within the soil which the king had given him to defend with an ominous perception that as his departing footsteps echoed adown the staircase the sway of britain was passing forever from new england he smote his clinched hand on his brow and cursed the destiny that had flung the shame of a dismembered empire upon him would to god cried he hardly repressing his tears of rage that the rebels were even now at the doorstep a upon the floor should then bear testimony that the last british ruler was faithful to his trust the tremulous voice of a woman replied to his exclamation heaven's cause and the king's are one it said go forth sir william howe and trust in heaven to bring back a royal governor in triumph subduing at once the passion to which he had yielded only in the faith that it was unwitnessed sir william howe became conscious that an aged woman leaning on a staff was standing betwixt him and the door it was old esther dudley who had dwelt almost immemorial years in this mansion until her presence seemed as inseparable from it as the recollections of its history she was the daughter of an ancient and once eminent family which had fallen into poverty and decay and left its last descendant no resource save the bounty of the king nor any shelter except within the walls of the province house an office in the household with merely nominal duties had been assigned to her as a pretext for the payment of a small pension the greater part of which she expended in adorning herself with an antique magnificence of attire the claims of esther dudley's gentle blood were acknowledged by all the successive governors and they treated her with the punctilious courtesy which it was her foible to demand not always with success from a neglectful world the only actual share which she assumed in the business of the mansion was to glide through its passages and public chambers late at night to see that the servants had dropped no fire from their flaring torches nor left embers crackling and blazing on the hearths perhaps it was this invariable custom of walking her rounds in the hush of midnight that caused the superstition of the times to invest the old woman with attributes of awe and mystery fabling that she had entered the portal of the province house none knew whence in the train of the first royal governor and that it was her fate to dwell there till the last should have departed but sir william howe if he ever heard this legend had forgotten it ii for more than two years eric hermannson kept the austere faith to which he had sworn himself kept it until a girl from the east came to spend a week on the nebraska divide she was a girl of other manners and conditions and there were greater distances between her life and eric's than all the miles which separated rattlesnake creek from new york city indeed she had no business to be in the west at all but ah across what leagues of land and sea by what improbable chances do the unrelenting gods bring to us our fate it was in a year of financial depression that wyllis elliot came to nebraska to buy cheap land and revisit the country where he had spent a year of his youth when he had graduated from harvard it was still customary for moneyed gentlemen to send their scapegrace sons to rough it on ranches in the wilds of nebraska or dakota or to consign them to a living death in the sagebrush of the black hills these young men did not always return to the ways of civilized life but wyllis elliot had not married a nor been shot in a cowpunchers brawl nor wrecked by bad whisky nor appropriated by a smirched adventuress he had been saved from these things by a girl his sister who had been very near to his life ever since the days when they read fairy tales together and dreamed the dreams that never come true on this his first visit to his father's ranch since he left it six years before he brought her with him she had been laid up half the winter from a sprain received while skating and had had too much time for reflection during those months she was restless and filled with a desire to see something of the wild country of which her brother had told her so much she was to be married the next winter and wyllis understood her when she begged him to take her with him on this long aimless jaunt across the continent to taste the last of their freedom together it comes to all women of her type that desire to taste the unknown which allures and terrifies to run one's whole soul's length out to the wind just once it had been an eventful journey wyllis somehow understood that strain of gypsy blood in his sister and he knew where to take her they had slept in sod houses on the platte river made the acquaintance of the personnel of a opera company on the train to deadwood dined in a camp of railroad constructors at the world's end beyond new castle gone through the black hills on horseback fished for trout in dome lake watched a dance at cripple creek where the lost souls who hide in the hills gathered for their besotted revelry and now last of all before the return to thraldom there was this little shack anchored on the windy crest of the divide a little black dot against the flaming sunsets a scented sea of cornland bathed in opalescent air and blinding sunlight margaret elliot was one of those women of whom there are so many in this day when old order passing giveth place to new beautiful talented critical unsatisfied tired of the world at for the moment the life and people of the divide interested her she was there but a week perhaps had she stayed longer that inexorable ennui which travels faster even than the vestibule limited would have overtaken her the week she tarried there was the week that eric hermannson was helping jerry lockhart thresh a week earlier or a week later and there would have been no story to write it was on thursday and they were to leave on saturday wyllis and his sister were sitting on the wide piazza of the ranchhouse staring out into the afternoon sunlight and protesting against the gusts of hot wind that blew up from the sandy riverbottom twenty miles to the southward the young man pulled his cap lower over his eyes and remarked this wind is the real thing you don't strike it anywhere else you remember we had a touch of it in algiers and i told you it came from kansas it's the keynote of this country wyllis touched her hand that lay on the hammock and continued gently i hope it's paid you sis roughing it's dangerous business it takes the taste out of things she shut her fingers firmly over the brown hand that was so like her own paid why wyllis i haven't been so happy since we were children and were going to discover the ruins of troy together some day do you know i believe i could just stay on here forever and let the world go on its own gait it seems as though the tension and strain we used to talk of last winter were gone for good as though one could never give one's strength out to such petty things any more wyllis brushed the ashes of his pipe away from the silk handkerchief that was knotted about his neck and stared moodily off at the skyline by joseph conrad kennedy is a country doctor and lives in colebrook on the shores of eastbay the high ground rising abruptly behind the red roofs of the little town crowds the quaint high street against the wall which defends it from the sea beyond the there curves for miles in a vast and regular sweep the barren beach of shingle with the village of brenzett standing out darkly across the water a spire in a clump of trees and still further out the perpendicular column of a lighthouse looking in the distance no bigger than a lead pencil marks the of the land the country at the back of brenzett is low and flat but the bay is fairly well sheltered from the seas and occasionally a big ship windbound or through stress of weather makes use of the anchoring ground a mile and a half due north from you as you stand at the back door of the ship inn in brenzett a dilapidated windmill near by lifting its shattered arms from a mound no loftier than a rubbish heap and a martello tower squatting at the edge half a mile to the south of the coastguard cottages are familiar to the skippers of small craft these are the official seamarks for the patch of trustworthy bottom represented on the admiralty charts by an irregular oval of dots enclosing several figures

ascending along this road you open a valley broad and shallow a wide green trough of pastures and hedges merging inland into a vista of purple tints and flowing lines closing the view in this valley down to brenzett and colebrook and up to darnford the market town fourteen miles away lies the practice of my friend kennedy he had begun life as surgeon in the navy and afterwards had been the companion of a famous traveller in the days when there were continents with unexplored interiors his papers on the fauna and flora made him known to scientific societies and now he had come to a country practice from choice the penetrating power of his mind acting like a corrosive fluid had destroyed his ambition i fancy his intelligence is of a scientific order of an investigating habit and of that unappeasable curiosity which believes that there is a particle of a general truth in every mystery a good many years ago now on my return from abroad he invited me to stay with him i came readily enough and as he could not neglect his patients to keep me company he took me on his rounds thirty miles or so of an afternoon sometimes i waited for him on the roads the horse reached after the leafy twigs and sitting in the dogcart i could hear laugh through the door left open of some cottage he had a big hearty laugh that would have fitted a man twice his size a brisk manner a bronzed face and a pair of grey profoundly attentive eyes he had the talent of making people talk to him freely and an inexhaustible patience in listening to their tales one day as we trotted out of a large village into a shady bit of road i saw on our left hand a low black cottage with diamond panes in the windows a creeper on the end wall a roof of shingle and some roses climbing on the rickety of the tiny porch kennedy pulled up to a walk a woman in full sunlight was throwing a dripping blanket over a line stretched between two old and as the bobtailed chestnut trying to get his head jerked the left hand covered by a thick glove the doctor raised his voice over the hedge your child amy i had the time to see her dull face red not with a mantling blush but as if her flat cheeks had been vigorously slapped and to take in the squat figure the scanty dusty brown hair drawn into a tight knot at the back of the head she looked quite young with a distinct catch in her breath her voice sounded low and timid well thank you we trotted again a young patient of yours i said and the doctor flicking the chestnut absently muttered her husband used to be she seems a dull creature i remarked listlessly precisely said kennedy she is very passive enough to look at the red hands hanging at the end of those short arms at those slow prominent brown eyes to know the inertness of her mind an inertness that one would think made it everlastingly safe from all the surprises of imagination and yet which of us is safe at any rate such as you see her she had enough imagination to fall in love the daughter of one isaac foster who from a small farmer has sunk into a shepherd the beginning of his misfortunes dating from his runaway marriage with the cook of his widowed father a apoplectic grazier who passionately struck his name off his will and had been heard to utter threats against his life but this old affair scandalous enough to serve as a motive for a greek tragedy arose from the similarity of their characters there are other tragedies less scandalous and of a subtler poignancy arising from irreconcilable differences and from that fear of the incomprehensible that hangs over all our heads over all our heads marilla adopts twins mrs rachel lynde was sitting at her kitchen window knitting a quilt just as she had been sitting one evening several years previously when matthew cuthbert had driven down over the hill with what mrs rachel called his imported orphan but that had been in springtime and this was late autumn and all the woods were leafless and the fields sere and brown the sun was just setting with a great deal of purple and golden pomp behind the dark woods west of avonlea when a buggy drawn by a comfortable brown nag came down the hill mrs rachel peered at it eagerly marilla getting home from the funeral she said to her husband who was lying on the kitchen lounge thomas lynde lay more on the lounge nowadays than he had been used to do but mrs rachel who was so sharp at noticing anything beyond her own household had not as yet noticed this and got the twins with her yes davy leaning over the dashboard grabbing at the tail and marilla jerking him back sitting up on the seat as prim as you please she always looks as if just been starched and ironed well poor marilla is going to have her hands full this winter and no mistake still i see that she could do anything less than take them under the circumstances and have anne to help her tickled to death over the whole business and she has a real knacky way with children i must say dear me it seem a day since poor matthew brought anne herself home and everybody laughed at the idea of marilla bringing up a child and now she has adopted twins never safe from being surprised till dead the fat pony jogged over the bridge in hollow and along the green gables lane face was rather grim it was ten miles from east grafton and davy keith seemed to be possessed with a passion for perpetual motion it was beyond power to make him sit still and she had been in an agony the whole way lest he fall over the back of the wagon and break his neck or tumble over the dashboard under the heels in despair she finally threatened to whip him soundly when she got him home whereupon davy climbed into her lap regardless of the reins flung his chubby arms about her neck and gave her a hug i believe you mean it he said smacking her wrinkled cheek affectionately you look like a lady whip a little boy just cause he keep still you find it awful hard to keep still when you was only s old as me no i always kept still when i was told said marilla trying to speak sternly albeit she felt her heart waxing soft within her under impulsive caresses well i that was cause you was a girl said davy squirming back to his place after another hug you was a girl once i though awful funny to think of it dora can sit still but there much fun in it i think seems to me it must be slow to be a girl here dora let me liven you up a bit method of livening up was to grasp curls in his fingers and give them a tug dora shrieked and then cried how can you be such a naughty boy and your poor mother just laid in her grave this very day demanded marilla despairingly but she was glad to die said davy confidentially i know cause she told me so she was awful tired of being sick a long talk the night before she died she told me you was going to take me and dora for the winter and i was to be a good boy going to be good but you be good running round just as well as sitting still and she said i was always to be kind to dora and stand up for her and going to do you call pulling her hair being kind to her well i going to let anybody else pull it said davy doubling up his fists and frowning just better try it i hurt her much she just cried cause a girl glad a boy but sorry a twin when jimmy sister conterdicks him he just says oldern you so of course i know better and that settles her but i tell dora that and she just goes on thinking diffrunt from me you might let me drive the for a spell since a man altogether marilla was a thankful woman when she drove into her own yard where the wind of the autumn night was dancing with the brown leaves anne was at the gate to meet them and lift the twins out dora submitted calmly to be kissed but davy responded to welcome with one of his hearty hugs and the cheerful announcement mr davy keith xiii it had never before occurred to him that she might after all have missed the purport of the document he had put in her way what if in her hurried inspection of the papers she had passed it over as related to the private business of some client what for instance was to prevent her concluding that glennard was the counsel of the unknown person who had sold the aubyn letters the subject was one not likely to fix her attention she was not a curious woman glennard at this point laid down his fork and glanced at her between the the alternative explanation of her indifference was not slow in presenting itself her head had the same listening droop as when he had caught sight of her the day before in company the attitude revived the vividness of his impression it was simple enough after all she had ceased to care for him because she cared for someone else as he followed her upstairs he felt a sudden stirring of his dormant anger his sentiments had lost all their factitious complexity he had already acquitted her of any connivance in his baseness and he felt only that he loved her and that she had escaped him this was now strangely enough his dominating thought the consciousness that he and she had passed through the fusion of love and had emerged from it as incommunicably apart as though the transmutation had never taken place every other passion he mused left some mark upon the nature but love passed like the flight of a ship across the waters she sank into her usual seat near the lamp and he leaned against the chimney moving about with an inattentive hand the on the mantel suddenly he caught sight of her reflection in the mirror she was looking at him he turned and their eyes met he moved across the room and stood before her something that i want to say to you he began in a low tone she held his gaze but her color deepened he noticed again with a jealous pang how her beauty had gained in warmth and meaning it was as though a transparent cup had been filled with wine he looked at her ironically never prevented your seeing your friends here he broke out why do you meet flamel in places nothing makes a woman so cheap she rose abruptly and they faced each other a few feet apart what do you mean she asked i saw you with him last sunday on the riverside drive he went on the utterance of the charge reviving his anger ah she murmured she sank into her chair again and began to play with a that lay on the table at her elbow her silence exasperated him well he burst out is that all you have to say do you wish me to explain she asked proudly do you imply i the right to i imply nothing i will tell you whatever you wish to know i went for a walk with mr flamel because he asked me to i suppose you went uninvited but there are certain things a sensible woman do she slink about in streets with men why you have seen him here she hesitated because he wanted to see me alone did he indeed and may i ask if you gratify all his wishes with equal alacrity i know that he has any others where i am concerned she paused again and then continued in a lower voice that somehow had an of warning he wished to bid me going away glennard turned on her a startled glance going away going to europe he goes for a long time i supposed you knew the last phrase revived his irritation you forget that i depend on you for my information about flamel your friend and not mine in fact sometimes wondered at your going out of your way to be so civil to him when you must see plainly enough that i like him her answer to this was not immediate she seemed to be choosing her words with care not so much for her own sake as for his and his exasperation was increased by the suspicion that she was trying to spare him he was your friend before he was mine i never knew him till i was married it was you who brought him to the house and who seemed to wish me to like him glennard gave a short laugh the defence was feebler than he had expected she was certainly not a clever woman your deference to my wishes is really beautiful but not the first time in history that a man has made a mistake in introducing his friends to his wife you must at any rate have seen since then that my enthusiasm had cooled but so perhaps has your eagerness to oblige me she met this with a silence that seemed to rob the taunt of half its efficacy is

spectacle of a man adventurous enough to undertake a journey through europe on foot after much thought i decided that i was a person fitted to furnish to mankind this spectacle so i determined to do it this was in march i looked about me for the right sort of person to accompany me in the capacity of agent and finally hired a mr harris for this service it was also my purpose to study art while in europe mr harris was in sympathy with me in this he was as much of an enthusiast in art as i was and not less anxious to learn to paint i desired to learn the german language so did harris toward the middle of april we sailed in the holsatia captain brandt and had a very pleasant trip indeed after a brief rest at hamburg we made preparations for a long pedestrian trip southward in the soft spring weather but at the last moment we changed the program for private reasons and took the we made a short halt at and found it an interesting city i would have liked to visit the birthplace of gutenburg but it could not be done as no memorandum of the site of the house has been kept so we spent an hour in the goethe mansion instead the city permits this house to belong to private parties instead of gracing and dignifying herself with the honor of possessing and protecting it frankfort is one of the sixteen cities which have the distinction of being the place where the following incident occurred charlemagne while chasing the saxons as he said or being chased by them as they said arrived at the bank of the river at dawn in a fog the enemy were either before him or behind him but in any case he wanted to get across very badly he would have given anything for a guide but none was to be had presently he saw a deer followed by her young approach the water he watched her judging that she would seek a ford and he was right she waded over and the army followed so a great frankish victory or defeat was gained or avoided and in order to commemorate the episode charlemagne commanded a city to be built there which he named frankfort the ford of the franks none of the other cities where this event happened were named for it this is good evidence that frankfort was the first place it occurred at frankfort has another distinction it is the birthplace of the german alphabet or at least of the german word for alphabet buchstaben they say that the first movable types were made on birch sticks buchstabe hence the name i was taught a lesson in political economy in frankfort i had brought from home a box containing a thousand very cheap cigars by way of experiment i stepped into a little shop in a queer old back street took four gaily decorated boxes of wax matches and three cigars and laid down a silver piece worth cents the man gave me cents change in frankfort everybody wears clean clothes and i think we noticed that this strange thing was the case in hamburg too and in the villages along the road even in the narrowest and poorest and most ancient quarters of frankfort neat and clean clothes were the rule the little children of both sexes were nearly always nice enough to take into a body's lap and as for the uniforms of the soldiers they were newness and brightness carried to perfection one could never detect a smirch or a grain of dust upon them the conductors and drivers wore pretty uniforms which seemed to be just out of the bandbox and their manners were as fine as their clothes chapter xxi billy takes her turn at questioning arkwright did not call to see alice greggory for some days he did not want to see alice now he told himself wearily that she could not help him fight this tiger skin that lay across his path the very fact of her presence by his side would indeed incapacitate himself for fighting so he deliberately stayed away from the annex until the day before he sailed for germany then he went out to say chagrined as he was at what he termed his imbecile stupidity in not knowing his own heart all these past months and convinced as he also was that alice and calderwell cared for each other he could see no way for him but to play the part of a man of kindliness and honor leaving a clear field for his preferred rival and bringing no shadow of regret to mar the happiness of the girl he loved as for being his old easy frank self on this last call however that was impossible so alice found plenty of fuel for her still burning fires of suspicion fires which had indeed blazed up anew at this second long period of absence on the part of arkwright naturally therefore the call was anything but a joy and comfort to either one arkwright was nervous gloomy and abnormally gay by turns alice was nervous and abnormally gay all the time then they said and arkwright went away he sailed the next day and alice settled down to the summer of study and hard work she had laid out for herself on the tenth of september billy came home she was brown and smiling she declared that she had had a perfectly beautiful time and that there couldn't be anything in the world nicer than the trip she and bertram had taken just they two together in answer to aunt hannah's solicitous inquiries she asserted that she was all well and rested now but there was a vaguely troubled questioning in her eyes that aunt hannah did not quite like aunt hannah however said nothing even to billy herself about this one of the first friends billy saw after her return was hugh calderwell as it happened bertram was out when he came so billy had the first of the call to herself she was not sorry for this as it gave her a chance to question calderwell a little concerning alice greggory something she had long ago determined to do at the first opportunity now tell me everything everything about everybody she began diplomatically settling herself comfortably for a good visit thank you i'm well and have had a passably agreeable summer barring the heat sundry persistent mosquitoes several grievous disappointments and a felon on my thumb he began with shameless imperturbability i have been to revere once to the circus once to nantasket three times and to keith's and the movies ten times perhaps to be accurate i have also but perhaps there was some one else you desired to inquire for he broke off turning upon his hostess a bland but unsmiling countenance oh no how could there be twinkled billy really hugh i always knew you had a pretty good opinion of yourself but i didn't credit you with thinking you were everybody go on i'm so interested hugh chuckled softly but there was a plaintive tone in his voice as he answered thanks no i've rather lost my interest now lack of appreciation always did discourage me we'll talk of something else please you enjoyed your trip very much it just couldn't have been nicer you were lucky the heat here has been something fierce what made you stay reasons too numerous and one too to mention besides you forget with dignity there is my profession i have joined the workers of the world now you know oh fudge hugh laughed billy you know very well you're as likely as not to start for the ends of the earth morning hugh drew himself up i don't seem to succeed in making people understand that i'm serious he began aggrievedly i with an expressive flourish of his hands he relaxed suddenly and fell back in his chair a slow smile came to his lips well billy i'll give up you've hit it he confessed i have thought seriously of starting morning for to the ends of the earth panama hugh well i have even this call was to be a if i went oh hugh but i really thought in spite of my teasing that you had settled down this time yes so did i sighed the man a little soberly but i guess it's no use billy oh i'm coming back of course and link arms again with their worthy highnesses john doe and richard roe but just now i've got a restless fit on me i want to see the wheels go round of course if i had my bread and butter and cigars to earn twould be different but i haven't and i know i haven't and i suspect that's where the trouble lies if it wasn't for those natal silver spoons of mine that bertram is always talking about things might be different but the spoons are there and always have been and i know they're all ready to dish out mountains to climb and lakes to paddle in any time i've a mind to say the word so i just say the word that's all vi on a bright sunshiny day with the breeze chasing her smoke far ahead the came into her arrival was at once noticed on shore and the seamen in harbour said look look at that steamer what's that siamese isn't she just look at her she seemed indeed to have been used as a running target for the secondary batteries of a cruiser a hail of minor shells could not have given her upper works a more broken torn and devastated aspect and she had about her the worn weary air of ships coming from the far ends of the world and indeed with truth for in her short passage she had been very far sighting verily even the coast of the great beyond whence no ship ever returns to give up her crew to the dust of the earth she was incrusted and gray with salt to the trucks of her masts and to the top of her funnel as though as some facetious seaman said the crowd on board had fished her out somewhere from the bottom of the sea and brought her in here for salvage and further excited by the felicity of his own wit he offered to give five pounds for her as she stands before she had been quite an hour at rest a meagre little man with a nose and a face cast in an angry mould landed from a sampan on the quay of the foreign concession and incontinently turned to shake his fist at her a tall individual with legs much too thin for a rotund stomach and with watery eyes strolled up and remarked just left her eh quick work he wore a soiled suit of blue flannel with a pair of dirty cricketing shoes a dingy gray moustache drooped from his lip and daylight could be seen in two places between the rim and the crown of his hat hallo what are you doing here asked the of the shaking hands hurriedly standing by for a job chance worth taking got a quiet hint explained the man with the broken hat in jerky apathetic wheezes the second shook his fist again at the there's a fellow there that ain't fit to have the command of a scow he declared quivering with passion while the other looked about listlessly is there but he caught sight on the quay of a heavy seaman's chest painted brown under a fringed sailcloth cover and lashed with new manila line he eyed it with awakened interest i would talk and raise trouble if it wasn't for that damned siamese flag nobody to go to or i would make it hot for him the fraud told his chief engineer that's another fraud for you i had lost my nerve the greatest lot of ignorant fools that ever sailed the seas no you can't think got your money all right inquired his seedy acquaintance suddenly yes paid me off on board raged the second mate get your breakfast on shore says he mean skunk commented the tall man vaguely and passed his tongue on his lips what about having a drink of some sort he struck me hissed the second mate no struck you don't say the man in blue began to bustle about sympathetically can't possibly talk here i want to know all about it struck eh let's get a fellow to carry your chest i know a quiet place where they have some bottled beer mr jukes who had been scanning the shore through a pair of glasses informed the chief engineer afterwards that our late second mate hasn't been long in finding a friend a chap looking uncommonly like a bummer i saw them walk away together from the quay the hammering and banging of the needful repairs did not disturb captain macwhirr the steward found in the letter he wrote in a tidy passages of such absorbing interest that twice he was nearly caught in the act but mrs macwhirr in the of the house stifled a yawn perhaps out of for she was alone she reclined in a and gilt near a tiled fireplace with japanese fans on the mantel and a glow of coals in the grate lifting her hands she glanced wearily here and there into the many pages it was not her fault they were so prosy so completely uninteresting from my darling wife at the beginning to your loving husband at the end she couldn't be really expected to understand all these ship affairs she was glad of course to hear from him but she had never asked herself why precisely they are called typhoons the mate did not seem to like it not in books couldn't think of letting it go on the paper rustled sharply a calm that lasted more than twenty minutes she read perfunctorily and the next words her thoughtless eyes caught on the top of another page were see you and the children again she had a movement of impatience he was always thinking of coming home he had never had such a good salary before what was the matter now chapter xxii the inhabitants of the hut received me with a mixture of joy and surprize their homely welcome and their artless sympathy were grateful to my feelings in the midst of their inquiries as to my health they avoided all allusions to the source of my malady they were honest creatures and i loved them well i participated in the tears which they shed when i mentioned to them my speedy departure for europe and promised to acquaint them with my welfare during my long absence they expressed great surprize when i informed them of my intention to visit my cottage alarm and foreboding overspread their features and they attempted to dissuade me from visiting an house which they firmly believed to be haunted by a thousand ghastly apparitions these apprehensions however had no power over my conduct i took an irregular path which led me to my own house all was vacant and forlorn a small enclosure near which the path led was the belonging to the family this i was obliged to pass once i had intended to enter it and ponder on the emblems and inscriptions which my uncle had caused to be made on the tombs of catharine and her children but now my heart faltered as i approached and i hastened forward that distance might conceal it from my view when i approached the recess my heart again sunk i averted my eyes and left it behind me as quickly as possible silence reigned through my habitation and a darkness which closed doors and shutters produced every object was connected with mine or my brother's history i passed the entry mounted the stair and unlocked the door of my chamber it was with difficulty that i curbed my fancy and smothered my fears slight movements and casual sounds were transformed into beckoning shadows and calling shapes i proceeded to the closet i opened and looked round it with fearfulness all things were in their accustomed order i sought and found the manuscript where i was used to deposit it this being secured there was nothing to detain me yet i stood and contemplated awhile the furniture and walls of my chamber i remembered how long this apartment had been a sweet and tranquil asylum i compared its former state with its present dreariness and reflected that i now beheld it for the last time here it was that the incomprehensible behaviour of carwin was witnessed this the stage on which that enemy of man shewed himself for a moment unmasked here the menaces of murder were wafted to my ear and here these menaces were executed these thoughts had a tendency to take from me my my feeble limbs refused to support me and i sunk upon a chair incoherent and exclamations escaped my lips the name of carwin was uttered and eternal woes woes like that which his malice had entailed upon us were heaped upon him i invoked heaven to drag to light and to punish this betrayer and accused its providence for having thus long delayed the retribution that was due to so enormous a guilt i have said that the window shutters were closed a feeble light however found entrance through the crevices a small window illuminated the closet and the door being closed a dim ray streamed through the a kind of twilight was thus created sufficient for the purposes of vision but at the same time involving all minuter objects in obscurity this darkness suited the colour of my thoughts i sickened at the remembrance of the past the prospect of the future excited my loathing i muttered in a low voice why should i live longer why should i drag a miserable being all for whom i ought to live have perished am i not myself hunted to death at that moment my despair suddenly became vigorous my nerves were no longer unstrung my powers that had long been deadened were revived my bosom swelled with a sudden energy and the conviction darted through my mind that to end my torments was at once practicable and wise i knew how to find way to the recesses of life i could use a lancet with some skill and could distinguish between vein and artery by piercing deep into the latter i should shun the evils which the future had in store for me and take refuge from my woes in quiet death i started on my feet for my feebleness was gone and hasted to the closet a lancet and other small instruments were preserved in a case which i had deposited here inattentive as i was to foreign considerations my ears were still open to any sound of mysterious import that should occur i thought i heard a step in the entry my purpose was suspended and i cast an eager glance at my chamber door which was open no one appeared unless the shadow which i discerned upon the floor was the outline of a man if it were i was authorized to suspect that some one was posted close to the entrance who possibly had overheard my exclamations my teeth chattered and a wild confusion took place of my momentary calm thus it was when a terrific visage had disclosed itself on a former night thus it was when the evil destiny of wieland assumed the lineaments of something human what horrid apparition was preparing to blast my sight chapter i the sweetheart of a

enemy xxii the beginning of the end xxiii we are two xxiv conclusion chapter i the sweetheart of a king the scene was not exactly new to me moved by the spirit of adventure or by an access of ennui which overtakes me at times i had several times visited the gaudy establishment of mercer on the fashionable side of fifth avenue in the fifties in either case i had found disappointment where the stake is a matter of indifference there can be no excitement and besides i had been always in luck but on this occasion i had a real purpose before me though not an important one and i surrendered my hat and coat to the servant at the door with a feeling of satisfaction at the entrance to the main room i met bob garforth leaving there was a scowl on his face and his hand trembled as he held it forth to take mine harry is inside what a rotten hole said he and passed on i smiled at his remark it was being whispered about that garforth had lost a quarter of a million at mercer's within the month and passed inside gaudy i have said it was and it needs no other word not in its elements but in their arrangement the rugs and pictures and hangings testified to the taste of the man who had selected them but they were abominably disposed and there were too many of them the room which was unusually large held two or three leather divans an english buffet and many easy chairs a covered stood in one corner groups of men were gathered about each of the three roulette wheels ranged along the farther side through a door to the left could be seen the poker tables surrounded by grave or jocular faces above the low buzz of conversation there sounded the continual droning voices of the croupiers as they called the winning numbers and an occasional exclamation from a customer i made my way to the center wheel and stood at the rear of the crowd surrounding it the ball rolled there was a straining of necks amid an intense silence then as the little pellet wavered and finally came to a rest in the hole number a fervent oath of disappointment came from some one in front of me the next moment rising on tiptoe to look over the intervening shoulders i found myself looking into the white face of my younger brother harry paul he exclaimed turning quickly away i pushed my way through and stood at his side there was no sound from the group of onlookers it is not to be wondered at if they hesitated to offend paul lamar my dear boy said i i missed you at dinner and though this may occupy your mind it can scarcely fill your stomach haven't you had enough harry looked at me his face was horribly pale and his eyes bloodshot they could not meet mine for heaven's sake paul let me alone he said hardly above a whisper i have lost ninety thousand in spite of myself i started no wonder he was pale and yet that's nothing i whispered back but you are making a show of yourself just now you were swearing like a sailor see how your hand trembles you were not made for this harry it makes you forget that you're a gentleman they are laughing at you come but i say i have lost ninety thousand dollars said the boy and there was wildness in his eye let me alone paul i will repay you no let me alone harry i say no his mouth was drawn tight and his eyes glared sullenly as those of a stubborn child clearly it was impossible to get him away without making a scene which was unthinkable for a moment i was at a complete loss then the croupier's voice sounded suddenly in my ear you are interrupting us sir i silenced him with a glance and turned to my brother having decided in an instant on the only possible course here let me have your chair i will get it back for you come he looked at me for a moment in hesitation then rose without a word and i took his place the thing was tiresome enough but how could i have avoided it the blood that rushes to the head of the gambler is certainly not food for the intellect and besides i was forced by circumstances into an heroic attitude and nothing is more distasteful to a man of sense but i had a task before me if a man lays bricks he should lay them well and i do not deny that there was a stirring of my pulse as i sat down chapter sometimes lolling upon tantor's back sometimes roaming the jungle in solitude korak made his way slowly toward the west and south he made but a few miles a day for he had a whole lifetime before him and no place in particular to go possibly he would have moved more rapidly but for the thought which continually haunted him that each mile he traversed carried him further and further away from meriem no longer his meriem as of yore it is true but still as dear to him as ever thus he came upon the trail of the sheik's band as it traveled down river from the point where the sheik had captured meriem to his own stockaded village korak pretty well knew who it was that had passed for there were few in the great jungle with whom he was not familiar though it had been years since he had come this far north he had no particular business however with the old sheik and so he did not propose following him the further from men he could stay the better pleased he would be he wished that he might never see a human face again men always brought him sorrow and misery the river suggested fishing and so he dawdled upon its shores catching fish after a fashion of his own devising and eating them raw when night came he curled up in a great tree beside the stream the one from which he had been fishing during the afternoon and was soon asleep numa roaring beneath him awoke him he was about to call out in anger to his noisy neighbor when something else caught his attention he listened was there something in the tree beside himself yes he heard the noise of something below him trying to clamber upward presently he heard the click of a crocodile's jaws in the waters beneath and then low but distinct by george the beggar nearly got me the voice was familiar korak glanced downward toward the speaker outlined against the faint luminosity of the water he saw the figure of a man clinging to a lower branch of the tree silently and swiftly the clambered downward he felt a hand beneath his foot he reached down and clutched the figure beneath him and dragged it up among the branches it struggled weakly and struck at him but korak paid no more attention than tantor to an ant he lugged his burden to the higher safety and greater comfort of a broad crotch and there he propped it in a sitting position against the bole of the tree numa still was roaring beneath them doubtless in anger that he had been robbed of his prey korak shouted down at him calling him in the language of the great apes old eater of carrion brother of dango the hyena and other choice appellations of jungle opprobrium the hon morison baynes listening felt assured that a gorilla had seized upon him he felt for his revolver and as he was drawing it stealthily from its holster a voice asked in perfectly good english who are you baynes started so that he nearly fell from the branch my god he exclaimed are you a man what did you think i was asked korak a gorilla replied baynes honestly korak laughed who are you he repeated i'm an englishman by the name of baynes but who the devil are you asked the hon morison they call me the killer replied korak giving the english translation of the name that akut had given him and then after a pause during which the hon morison attempted to pierce the darkness and catch a glimpse of the features of the strange being into whose hands he had fallen you are the same whom i saw kissing the girl at the edge of the great plain to the east that time that the lion charged you yes replied baynes what are you doing here the girl was stolen i am trying to rescue her stolen the word was shot out like a bullet from a gun who stole her the swede trader hanson replied baynes where is he baynes related to korak all that had transpired since he had come upon hanson's camp before he was done the first gray dawn had relieved the darkness korak made the englishman comfortable in the tree he filled his canteen from the river and fetched him fruits to eat then he bid him i am going to the swede's camp he announced i will bring the girl back to you here i shall go too then insisted baynes it is my right and my duty for she was to have become my wife korak winced you are wounded you could not make the trip he said i can go much faster alone go then replied baynes but i shall follow it is my right and duty as you will replied korak with a shrug if the man wanted to be killed it was none of his affair he wanted to kill him himself but for meriem's sake he would not if she loved him then he must do what he could to preserve him but he could not prevent his following him more than to advise him against it and this he did earnestly chapter xxvi burning daylight the ten days of tudor's convalescence that followed were peaceful days on berande the work of the plantation went on like with the crushing of the premature outbreak of gogoomy and his following all insubordination seemed to have vanished twenty more of the boys their term of service up were carried away by the martha and the fresh stock of labour treated fairly was proving of excellent quality as sheldon rode about the plantation acknowledging to himself the comfort and convenience of a horse and wondering why he had not thought of getting one himself he pondered the various improvements for which joan was responsible the splendid recruits the fruits and vegetables the martha herself snatched from the sea for a song and earning money hand over fist despite old kinross's slow and safe method of running her and berande once more financially secure approaching each day nearer the time and growing each day as the black toilers cleared the bush cut the and planted more cocoanut palms in these and a thousand ways sheldon was made aware of how much he was indebted for material prosperity to joan to the slender girl with romance shining out of her gray eyes and adventure shouting from the colt's on her hip who had landed on the beach that piping gale along with her stalwart tahitian crew and who had entered his bungalow to hang with boy's hands her and baden powell hat on the nail by the billiard table he forgot all the early exasperations remembering only her charms and sweetnesses and glorying much in the traits he at first had disliked most her boyishness and adventurousness her delight to swim and risk the sharks her desire to go recruiting her love of the sea and ships her sharp authoritative words when she launched the and with firestick in one hand and in the other departed with her picturesque crew to shoot fish in the balesuna her disdain for the commonest conventions her juvenile joy in argument her fluttering love of freedom and mad passion for independence all this he now loved and he no longer desired to tame and hold her though the paradox was the winning of her without the taming and the holding there were times when he was dizzy with thought of her and love of her when he would stop his horse and with closed eyes picture her as he had seen her that first day in the of the dashing madly in to shore and marching belligerently along his veranda to remark that it was pretty hospitality this letting strangers sink or swim in his front yard and as he opened his eyes and urged his horse onward he would ponder for the ten thousandth time how possibly he was ever to hold her when she was so wild and that she was bound to flutter out and away from under his hand it was patent to sheldon that tudor had become interested in joan that convalescent visitor practically lived on the veranda though while preposterously weak and shaky in the legs he had for some time insisted on coming in to join them at the table at meals the first warning sheldon had of the other's growing interest in the girl was when tudor eased down and finally ceased pricking him with his habitual sharpness of quip and speech this cessation of verbal sparring was like the breaking off of diplomatic relations between countries at the beginning of war and once sheldon's suspicions were aroused he was not long in finding other confirmations tudor too obviously joyed in joan's presence too obviously laid himself out to amuse and fascinate her with his own glorious and adventurous personality often after his morning ride over the plantation or coming in from the store or from inspection of the sheldon found the pair of them together on the veranda joan listening intent and excited and tudor deep in some recital of personal adventure at the ends of the earth sheldon noticed too the way tudor looked at her and followed her about with his eyes and in those eyes he noted a certain hungry look and on the face a certain wistful expression and he wondered if on his own face he carried a similar involuntary advertisement he was sure of several things first that tudor was not the right man for joan and could not possibly make her permanently happy next that joan was too sensible a girl really to fall in love with a man of such superficial stamp and finally that tudor would blunder his somehow and at the same time with true lover's anxiety sheldon feared that the other might somehow fail to blunder and win the girl with purely fortuitous and successful meretricious show but of the one thing sheldon was sure tudor had no intimate knowledge of her and was unaware of how vital in her was her wildness and love of independence that was where he would blunder in the catching and the holding of her and then in spite of all his certitude sheldon could not forbear wondering if his theories of joan might not be wrong and if tudor was not going the right way about after all henry van dyke there was an air of calm and reserved opulence about the weightman mansion that spoke not of money squandered but of wealth prudently applied standing on a corner of the avenue no longer fashionable for residence it looked upon the swelling tide of business with an expression of complacency and the house was not beautiful there was nothing in its straight front of stone its heavy cornices its broad staring windows of plate glass its carved and mahogany doors at the top of the wide stoop to charm the eye or fascinate the imagination but it was eminently respectable and in its way imposing it seemed to say that the glittering shops of the jewelers the milliners the confectioners the florists the the furriers the makers of rare and costly antiquities retail traders in luxuries of life were beneath the notice of a house that had its foundations in the high finance and was built literally and figuratively in the shadow of st petronius church at the same time there was something and congratulatory in the way in which the mansion held its own amid the changing neighborhood it almost seemed to be lifted up a little among the tall buildings near at hand as if it felt the rising value of the land on which it stood john weightman was like the house into which he had built himself thirty years ago and in which his ideals and ambitions were incrusted he was a man but in making himself he had chosen a highly esteemed pattern and worked according to the approved rules there was nothing irregular questionable flamboyant about him he was solid correct and justly successful his minor tastes of course had been carefully kept up to date at the proper time pictures of the barbizon masters old english plate and portraits bronzes by barye and marbles by rodin persian carpets and chinese porcelains had been introduced to the mansion it contained a louis quinze an empire a jacobean and various apartments dimly reminiscent of the styles of furniture affected by deceased monarchs that the hallways were too short for the historic perspective did not make much difference american decorative art is capable de tout it absorbs all periods of each period mr weightman wished to have something of the best he understood its value present as a certificate and prospective as an investment it was only in the architecture of his town house that he remained conservative immovable one might almost say his country house at was a palace of the italian renaissance but in town he adhered to an architecture which had moral associations the epoch it was a symbol of his social position his religious doctrine and even in a way of his business creed a man of fixed principles he would say should express them in the looks of his house new york changes its domestic architecture too rapidly it is like divorce it is not dignified i don't like it extravagance and fickleness are advertised in most of these new houses i wish to be known for different qualities dignity and prudence are the things that people trust every one knows that i can afford to live in the house that suits me it is a guarantee to the public it inspires confidence it helps my influence there is a text in the bible about a house that hath foundations that is the proper kind of a mansion for a solid man harold weightman had often listened to his father discoursing in this fashion on the fundamental principles of life and always with a divided mind he admired immensely his father's talents and the energy with which he improved them but in the paternal philosophy there was something that disquieted and oppressed the young man and made him gasp inwardly for fresh air and free action at times during his college course and his years at the law school he had yielded to this impulse and broken away now toward extravagance and dissipation and then when the reaction came toward a romantic devotion to work among the poor he had felt his father's disapproval for both of these forms of imprudence but is was never expressed in a harsh or violent way always with a certain tolerant patience such as one might show for the mistakes and vagaries of the very young john weightman was not hasty impulsive inconsiderate even toward his own children with them as with the rest of the world he felt that he had a reputation to maintain a theory to vindicate he could afford to give them time to see that he was absolutely right one of his favorite scripture quotations was wait on the lord he had applied it to real estate and to people with profitable results but to human persons the sensation of being waited for is not always agreeable sometimes especially with the young it produces a vague restlessness a dumb resentment which is increased by the fact that one can hardly explain or justify it of this john weightman was not conscious it lay beyond his horizon he did not take it into account in the plan of life which he made for himself and for his family as the sharers and inheritors of his success at an upper window it was very early the next morning a time of sun and dew the confused beginnings of many birds songs spread into the healthy air and the wan blue of the heaven was here and there coated with thin webs of incorporeal cloud which were of no effect in obscuring day all the lights in the scene were yellow as to colour and all the shadows were attenuated as to form the creeping plants about the old were bowed with rows of heavy water drops which had upon objects behind them the effect of minute lenses of high magnifying power just before the clock struck five gabriel oak and coggan passed the village cross and went on together to the fields they were yet barely in view of their mistress's house when oak fancied he saw the opening of a casement in one of the upper windows the two men were at this moment partially screened by an elder bush now beginning to be enriched with black bunches of fruit and they paused before emerging from its shade a handsome man leaned idly from the lattice he looked east and then west in the manner of one who makes a first morning survey the man was sergeant troy his red jacket was loosely thrown on but not buttoned and he had altogether the relaxed bearing of a soldier taking his ease coggan spoke first looking quietly at the window she has married him he said gabriel had previously beheld the sight and he now stood with his back turned making no reply i fancied we should know something continued coggan i heard wheels pass my door just after dark you were out somewhere he glanced round upon gabriel good heavens above us oak how white your face is you look like a corpse do i said oak with a faint smile lean on the gate i'll wait a bit all right all right they stood by the gate awhile gabriel listlessly staring at the ground his mind sped into the future and saw there enacted in years of leisure the scenes of repentance that would ensue from this work of haste that they were married he had instantly decided why had it been so mysteriously managed it had become known that she had had a fearful journey to bath owing to her miscalculating the distance that the horse had broken down and that she had been more than two days getting there it was not bathsheba's way to do things furtively with all her faults she was candour itself could she have been entrapped the union was not only an unutterable grief to him it amazed him notwithstanding that he had passed the preceding week in a suspicion that such might be the issue of troy's meeting her away from home her quiet return with liddy had to some extent dispersed the dread just as that imperceptible motion which appears like stillness is infinitely divided in its properties from stillness itself so had his hope undistinguishable from despair differed from despair indeed in a few minutes they moved on again towards the house the sergeant still looked from the window morning comrades he shouted in a cheery voice when they came up coggan replied to the greeting bain't ye going to answer the man he then said to gabriel i'd say good morning you needn't spend a hapenny of meaning upon it and yet keep the man civil gabriel soon decided too that since the deed was done to put the best face upon the matter would be the greatest kindness to her he loved good morning sergeant troy he returned in a ghastly voice a rambling gloomy house this said troy smiling why they may not be married suggested coggan perhaps she's not there gabriel shook his head the soldier turned a little towards the east and the sun kindled his scarlet coat to an orange glow but it is a nice old house responded gabriel yes i suppose so but i feel like new wine in an old bottle here my notion is that should be put throughout and these old wainscoted walls brightened up a bit or the oak cleared quite away and the walls papered it would be a pity i think well no a philosopher once said in my hearing that the old builders who worked when art was a living thing had no respect for the work of builders who went before them but pulled down and altered as they thought fit and why shouldn't we creation and preservation don't do well together says he and a million of antiquarians can't invent a style my mind exactly i am for making this place more modern that we may be cheerful whilst we can the military man turned and surveyed the interior of the room to assist his ideas of improvement in this direction gabriel and coggan began to move on oh coggan said troy as if inspired by a recollection do you know if insanity has ever appeared in mr boldwood's family jan reflected for a moment i once heard that an uncle of his was queer in his head but i don't know the rights o't he said it is of no importance said troy lightly well i shall be down in the fields with you some time this week but i have a few matters to attend to first so to you we shall of course keep on just as friendly terms as usual i'm not a proud man nobody is ever able to say that of sergeant troy however what is must be and here's to drink my health men chapter xv a forlorn woman went along a lighted avenue the street was filled with people desperately bound on missions an endless crowd darted at the elevated station stairs and the horse cars were thronged with owners of bundles the pace of the forlorn woman was slow she was apparently searching for some one she loitered near the doors of saloons and watched men emerge from them she scanned furtively the faces in the rushing stream of pedestrians hurrying men bent on catching some boat or train jostled her elbows failing to notice her their thoughts fixed on distant dinners the forlorn woman had a peculiar face her smile was no smile but when in repose her features had a shadowy look that was like a sardonic grin as if some one had sketched with cruel forefinger indelible lines about her mouth jimmie came strolling up the avenue the woman encountered him with an aggrieved air oh jimmie i've been lookin all over fer yehs she began jimmie made an impatient gesture and quickened his pace ah don't bodder me good gawd he said with the savageness of a man whose life is pestered the woman followed him along the sidewalk in somewhat the manner of a suppliant but jimmie she said yehs told me

fingers on his arm but jimmie snarled oh go teh hell he darted into the front door of a convenient saloon and a moment later came out into the shadows that surrounded the side door on the brilliantly lighted avenue he perceived the forlorn woman dodging about like a scout jimmie laughed with an air of relief and went away when he arrived home he found his mother clamoring maggie had returned she stood shivering beneath the torrent of her mother's wrath well i'm damned said jimmie in greeting his mother tottering about the room pointed a quivering forefinger lookut her jimmie lookut her dere's yer sister boy dere's yer sister lookut her lookut her she screamed in scoffing laughter the girl stood in the middle of the room she edged about as if unable to find a place on the floor to put her

party on anudder tear naw young mag's come home deh hell yeh say through the open door curious eyes stared in at maggie children ventured into the room and ogled her as if they formed the front row at a theatre women without bended toward each other and whispered nodding their heads with airs of profound philosophy a baby overcome with curiosity concerning this object at which all were looking sidled forward and touched her dress cautiously as if investigating a stove its mother's voice rang out like a warning trumpet she rushed forward and grabbed her child casting a terrible look of indignation at the girl maggie's mother paced to and fro addressing the doorful of eyes expounding like a glib showman at a museum her voice rang through the building dere she stands she cried

the jeering cries ended in another burst of shrill laughter the girl seemed to awaken jimmie he drew hastily back from her well now yer a hell of a t'ing ain yeh he said his lips curling in scorn radiant virtue sat upon his brow and his repelling hands expressed horror of contamination maggie turned and went the crowd at the door fell back precipitately a baby falling down in front of the door wrenched a scream like a wounded animal from its mother another woman sprang forward and picked it up with a chivalrous air as if rescuing a human being from an oncoming express train as the girl passed down through the hall she went before open doors framing more eyes strangely microscopic and sending broad beams of inquisitive light into the darkness of her path on the second floor she met the gnarled old woman who possessed the music box so she cried ere yehs are back again are yehs an dey've kicked yehs out well come in an stay wid me i ain got no moral standin paulvitch plots revenge as jane and tarzan stood upon the vessel's deck recounting to one another the details of the various adventures through which each had passed since they had parted in their london home there glared at them from beneath scowling brows a hidden watcher upon the shore through the man's brain passed plan after plan whereby he might thwart the escape of the englishman and his wife for so long as the vital spark remained within the vindictive brain of alexander paulvitch none who had aroused the enmity of the russian might be entirely safe plan after plan he formed only to discard each either as impracticable or unworthy the vengeance his wrongs demanded so warped by faulty reasoning was the criminal mind of rokoff's lieutenant that he could not grasp the real truth of that which lay between himself and the and see that always the fault had been not with the english lord but with himself and his confederate and at the rejection of each new scheme paulvitch arrived always at the same conclusion that he could accomplish naught while half the breadth of the ugambi separated him from the object of his hatred but how was he to span the waters there was no canoe nearer than the mosula village and paulvitch was none too sure that the kincaid would still be at anchor in the river when he returned should he take the time to traverse the jungle to the distant village and return with a canoe yet there was no other way and so convinced that thus alone might he hope to reach his prey paulvitch with a parting scowl at the two figures upon the kincaid's deck turned away from the river hastening through the dense jungle his mind centred upon his one fetich revenge the russian forgot even his terror of the savage world through which he moved baffled and beaten at every turn of fortune's wheel reacted upon time after time by his own malign plotting the principal victim of his own criminality paulvitch was yet so blind as to imagine that his greatest happiness lay in a continuation of the plottings and schemings which had ever brought him and rokoff to disaster and the latter finally to a hideous death as the russian stumbled on through the jungle toward the mosula village there presently crystallized within his brain a plan which seemed more feasible than any that he had as yet considered he would come by night to the side of the kincaid and once aboard would search out the members of the ship's original crew who had survived the terrors of this frightful expedition and enlist them in an attempt to wrest the vessel from tarzan and his beasts in the cabin were arms and ammunition and hidden in a secret receptacle in the cabin table was one of those infernal machines the construction of which had occupied much of paulvitch's spare time when he had stood high in the confidence of the nihilists of his native land that was before he had sold them out for immunity and gold to the police of petrograd paulvitch winced as he recalled the denunciation of him that had fallen from the lips of one of his former comrades ere the poor devil expiated his political sins at the end of a hempen rope but the infernal machine was the thing to think of now he could do much with that if he could but get his hands upon it within the little hardwood case hidden in the cabin table rested sufficient potential destructiveness to wipe out in the fraction of a second every enemy aboard the kincaid paulvitch licked his lips in anticipatory joy and urged his tired legs to greater speed that he might not be too late to the ship's anchorage to carry out his designs all depended of course upon when the kincaid departed the russian realized that nothing could be accomplished beneath the light of day darkness must shroud his approach to the ship's side for should he be sighted by tarzan or lady greystoke he would have no chance to board the vessel the gale that was blowing was he believed the cause of the delay in getting the kincaid under way and if it continued to blow until night then the chances were all in his favour for he knew that there was little likelihood of the attempting to navigate the tortuous channel of the ugambi while darkness lay upon the surface of the water hiding the many bars and the numerous small islands which are scattered over the expanse of the river's mouth it was well after noon when paulvitch came to the mosula village upon the bank of the tributary of the ugambi here he was received with suspicion and unfriendliness by the native chief who like all those who came in contact with rokoff or paulvitch had suffered in some manner from the greed the cruelty or the lust of the two muscovites when paulvitch demanded the use of a canoe the chief grumbled a surly refusal and ordered the white man from the village surrounded by angry muttering warriors who seemed to be but waiting some slight pretext to transfix him with their menacing spears the russian could do naught else than withdraw to hubert dear hubert if i ever found a lying round stand upon it and say take me to hubert right away and then travel very far to where the magic countries are that you and i will never see and choose the loveliest gifts for you from me but oh alack and no come my way i never found a phoenix yet and psammeads are so hard to get so i give you nothing fine only this book your book and mine and hers whose name by yours is set your book my book the book of margaret e nesbit dymchurch september contents the egg the topless tower the queen cook two bazaars the temple doing good mews from persia the cats the cow and the burglar the bride the hole in the carpet the beginning of the end the end of the end chapter the egg it began with the day when it was almost the fifth of november and a doubt arose in some breast i fancy as to the quality of the fireworks laid in for the guy fawkes celebration they were jolly cheap said whoever it was and i think it was robert and suppose they go off on the night those prosser kids would have something to snigger about then the ones i got are all right jane said i know they are because the man at the shop said they were worth thribble the money sure thribble grammar anthea said of course it said cyril one word be grammar all by itself so you be so jolly clever anthea was rummaging in the of her mind for a very disagreeable answer when she remembered what a wet day it was and how the boys had been disappointed of that ride to london and back on the top of the tram which their mother had promised them as a reward for not having once forgotten for six whole days to wipe their boots on the mat when they came home from school so anthea only said be so jolly clever yourself squirrel and the fireworks look all right and have the eightpence that your tram fares cost to buy something more with you ought to get a perfectly lovely catharine wheel for eightpence i daresay said cyril coldly but not your eightpence anyhow but look here said robert really now about the fireworks we want to be disgraced before those kids next door they think because they wear red plush on sundays no one else is any good i wear plush if it was ever so unless it was black to be beheaded in if i was mary queen of scots said anthea with scorn robert stuck steadily to his point one great point about robert is the steadiness with which he can stick i think we ought to test them he said you young duffer said cyril fireworks are like you can only use them once what do you suppose it means by tested seeds in the advertisement there was a blank silence then cyril touched his forehead with his finger and shook his head a little wrong here he said i was always afraid of that with poor robert all that cleverness you know and being top in algebra so often bound to tell dry up said robert fiercely you see you test seeds if you do them all you just take a few here and there and if those grow you can feel pretty sure the others will be what do you call it father told me up to sample you think we ought to sample the just shut our eyes and each draw one out and then try them but raining cats and dogs said jane and queen anne is dead rejoined robert no one was in a very good temper we go out to do them we can just move back the table and let them off on the old we play toboggans with i know what you think but i think time we did something and that would be really useful because then we just hope the fireworks would make those prossers sit up we should know it would be something to do cyril owned with languid approval so the table was moved back and then the hole in the carpet that had been near the window till the carpet was turned round showed most awfully but anthea stole out on and got the tray when cook looking and brought it in and put it over the hole then all the fireworks were put on the table and each of the four children shut its eyes very tight and put out its hand and grasped something robert took a cracker cyril and anthea had roman candles but fat paw closed on the gem of the whole collection the that had cost two shillings and one at least of the party i will not say which because it was sorry afterwards declared that jane had done it on purpose nobody was pleased for the worst of it was that these four children with a very proper dislike of anything even faintly bordering on the sneakish had a law unalterable as those of the medes and persians that one had to stand by the results of a or a drawing of lots or any other appeal to chance however much one might happen to dislike the way things were turning out iii at the entrance to the street the wind still raged and the road was thickly covered with snow but well within the village it was calm warm and cheerful at one house a dog was barking at another a woman covering her head with her coat came running from somewhere and entered the door of a hut stopping on the threshold to have a look at the passing sledge in the middle of the village girls could be heard singing here in the village there seemed to be less wind and snow and the frost was less keen why this is grishkino said vasili andreevich so it is responded nikita it really was grishkino which meant that they had gone too far to the left and had travelled some six miles not quite in the direction they aimed at but towards their destination for all that from grishkino to goryachkin was about another four miles in the middle of the village they almost ran into a tall man walking down the middle of the street who are you shouted the man stopping the horse and recognizing vasili anereevich he immediately took hold of the shaft went along it hand over hand till he reached the sledge and placed himself on the seat he was isay a peasant of vasili acquaintance and well known as the principal in the district ah vasili andreevich where are you off to said isay enveloping nikita in the odour of the vodka he had drunk we were going to goryachkin and look where got to you should have gone through molchanovka should have but manage it said vasili andreevich holding in the horse a good horse said isay with a shrewd glance at mukhorty and with a practised hand he tightened the loosened knot high in the bushy tail are you going to stay the night no friend i must get on your business must be pressing and who is this ah nikita stepanych who else replied nikita but i say good friend how are we to avoid going astray again where can you go astray here turn back straight down the street and then when you come out keep straight on take to the left you will come out onto the high road and then turn to the right and where do we turn off the high road as in summer or the winter way asked nikita the winter way as soon as you turn off see some bushes and opposite them there is a a large oak one with branches and the way vasili andreevich turned the horse back and drove through the outskirts of the village why not stay the night isay shouted after them but vasili andreevich did not answer and touched up the horse four miles of good road two of which lay through the forest seemed easy to manage especially as the wind was apparently quieter and the snow had stopped having driven along the trodden village street darkened here and there by fresh manure past the yard where the clothes hung out and where the white shirt had broken loose and was now attached only by one frozen sleeve they again came within sound of the weird moan of the willows and again emerged on the open fields the storm far from ceasing seemed to have grown yet stronger the road was completely covered with drifting snow and only the stakes showed that they had not lost their way but even the stakes ahead of them were not easy to see since the wind blew in their faces vasili andreevich screwed up his eyes bent down his head and looked out for the but trusted mainly to the sagacity letting it take its own way and the horse really did not lose the road but followed its windings turning now to the right and now to the left and sensing it under his feet so that though the snow fell thicker and the wind strengthened they still continued to see now to the left and now to the right of them so they travelled on for about ten minutes when suddenly through the slanting screen of snow something black showed up which moved in front of the horse this was another sledge with mukhorty overtook them and struck his hoofs against the back of the sledge in front of them pass on hey there get in front cried voices from the sledge vasili andreevich swerved aside to pass the other sledge in it sat three men and a woman evidently visitors returning from a feast one peasant was whacking the croup of their little horse with a long switch and the other two sitting in front waved their arms and shouted something the woman completely wrapped up and covered with snow sat drowsing and bumping at the back who are you shouted vasili andreevich from was all that could be heard i say where are you from from one of the peasants shouted with all his might but still it was impossible to make out who they were get along keep up shouted another ceaselessly beating his horse with the switch so from a feast it seems go on go on faster simon get in front faster on the look out in these times of ours though concerning the exact year there is no need to be precise a boat of dirty and disreputable appearance with two figures in it floated on the thames between southwark bridge which is of iron and london bridge which is of stone as an autumn evening was closing in the figures in this boat were those of a strong man with ragged grizzled hair and a face and a dark girl of nineteen or twenty sufficiently like him to be recognizable as his daughter the girl rowed pulling a pair of sculls very easily the man with the slack in his hands and his hands loose in his waistband kept an eager look out he had no net hook or line and he could not be a fisherman his boat had no cushion for a sitter no paint no inscription no appliance beyond a rusty boathook and a coil of rope and he could not be a waterman his boat was too crazy and too small to take in cargo for delivery and he could not be a lighterman or there was no clue to what he looked for but he looked for something with a most intent and searching gaze the tide which had turned an hour before was running down and his eyes watched every little race and eddy in its broad sweep as the boat made slight against it or drove stern foremost before it according as he directed his daughter by a movement of his head she watched his face as earnestly as he watched the river but in the intensity of her look there was a touch of dread or horror allied to the bottom of the river rather than the surface by reason of the slime and ooze with which it was covered and its sodden state this boat and the two figures in it obviously were doing something that they often did and were seeking what they often sought half savage as the man showed with no covering on his matted head with his brown arms bare to between the elbow and the shoulder with the loose knot of a looser kerchief lying low on his bare breast in a wilderness of beard and whisker with such dress as he wore seeming to be made out of the mud that begrimed his boat still there was a usage in his steady gaze so with every lithe action of the girl with every turn of her wrist perhaps most of all with her look of dread or horror they were things of usage keep her out lizzie tide runs strong here keep her well afore the sweep of it trusting to the skill and making no use of the rudder he eyed the coming tide with an absorbed attention so the girl eyed him but it happened now that a slant of light from the setting sun glanced into the bottom of the boat and touching a rotten stain there which bore some resemblance to the outline of a muffled human form coloured it as though with diluted blood this caught the eye and she shivered what ails you said the man immediately aware of it though so intent on the advancing waters i see nothing afloat the red light was gone the shudder was gone and his gaze which had come back to the boat for a moment travelled away again wheresoever the strong tide met with an impediment his gaze paused for an instant at every and rope at every stationery boat or barge that split the current into a at the offsets from the piers of southwark bridge at the paddles of the river steamboats as they beat the filthy water at the floating logs of timber lashed together lying off certain wharves his shining eyes darted a hungry look after a darkening hour or so suddenly the tightened in his hold and he steered hard towards the surrey shore always watching his face the girl instantly answered to the action in her sculling presently the boat swung round quivered as from a sudden jerk and the upper half of the man was stretched out over the stern the girl pulled the hood of a cloak she wore over her head and over her face and looking backward so that the front folds of this hood were turned down the river kept the boat in that direction going before the tide until now the boat had barely held her own and had hovered about one spot but now the banks changed swiftly and the deepening shadows and the kindling lights of london bridge were passed and the tiers of shipping lay on either hand it was not until now that the upper half of the man came back into the boat his arms were wet and dirty and he washed them over the side in his right hand he held something and he washed that in the river too it was money he chinked it once and he blew upon it once and he spat upon it once for luck he hoarsely said before he put it in his pocket elargizione del re all ospedale italiano the first line means that the italian sovereigns are coming back they have been to england the second line seems to mean that they enlarged the king at the italian hospital with a banquet i suppose an english banquet has that effect further il ritorno dei sovrani a roma roma ore i sovrani e le principessine reali si attendono a roma domani alle ore return of the sovereigns to rome you see date of the

vecchio stammattina circe le mentre giuseppe sciatti di anni di casellina e torri passava dal ponte vecchio stando seduto sopra un barroccio carico di verdura perse l equilibrio e cadde al suolo

on himself arriving with his left leg under one of the wheels of the vehicle said sciatti was suddenly harvested gathered in by several citizens who by means of public cab no transported him to st john of god paragraph no is a little obscure but i think it says that the medico set the broken left leg right enough since there was nothing the matter with the other one and that several are encouraged to hope that fifty days well fetch him around in quite way if no complications intervene i am sure i hope so myself there is a great and peculiar charm about reading in a language which you are not acquainted with the charm that always goes with the mysterious and the uncertain you can never be absolutely sure of the meaning of anything you read in such circumstances you are chasing an alert and gamy riddle all the time and the baffling turns and dodges of the prey make the life of the hunt a dictionary would spoil it sometimes a single word of doubtful purport will cast a veil of dreamy and golden uncertainty over a whole paragraph of cold and practical certainties and leave steeped in a haunting and adorable mystery an incident which had been vulgar and commonplace but for that benefaction would you be wise to draw a dictionary on that gracious word would you be properly grateful after a couple of days rest i now come back to my subject and seek a case in point i find

panic among the spectators nobody hurt chapter xviii the gulf between for three months billy met and third and fighters from new york and its environs he thrashed them all usually by the knockout route and finally local sports commenced talking about him a bit and he was matched up with from other cities these men he cleaned up as handily as he had the others so that it was apparent to fight fandom that the big quiet unknown was a comer and pretty soon professor cassidy received an offer from another to match billy against a real hope who stood in the forefront of hopedom this other manager stated that he thought the mill would prove excellent practice for his man who was having difficulty in finding opponents professor cassidy thought so too and grinned for two hours straight after reading the challenge the details of the fight were quickly arranged in accordance with the state regulations it was to be a ten round no decision bout the weight of the gloves was prescribed by law the name of the white hope against whom billy was to go was sufficient to draw a fair house and there were some there who had seen billy in other fights and looked for a good mill when the coming champion as billy's opponent was introduced stepped into the ring he received a hearty round of applause whereas there was but a scattered ripple of handclapping to greet the mucker it was the first time he ever had stepped into a ring with a fighter and as he saw the huge muscles of his antagonist and recalled the stories he had heard of his prowess and science billy for the first time in his life felt a tremor of nervousness his eyes wandered across the ropes to the sea of faces turned up toward him and all of a sudden billy byrne went into a blue funk professor cassidy shrewd and experienced saw it even as soon as billy realized it he saw the fading of his high hopes he saw his castles in spain tumbling in ruins about his ears he saw his huge giant lying prone within that squared circle as the hand of the referee rose and fell in cadence to the ticking of seconds that would count his man out here he whispered take a swig o this and he pressed a bottle toward billy's lips billy shook his head the stuff had kept him down all his life he had sworn never to touch another drop of it and he never would whether he lost this and every other fight he ever fought he had sworn to leave it alone for her sake and then the gong called him to the center of the ring billy knew that he was afraid he thought that he was afraid of the big trained fighter who faced him but cassidy knew that it was a plain case of stage fright that had gripped his man he knew too that it would be enough to defeat billy's every chance for victory and after the big white hope had felled billy twice in the first minute of the first round cassidy knew that it was all over but the shouting the fans many of them were laughing and yelling derogatory remarks at billy stan up an fight yeh big stiff and back to de farm fer youse and then high above the others a shrill voice cried coward coward the word penetrated billy's hopeless muddled brain coward she had called him that once and then she had changed her mind theriere had thought him a coward yet as he died he had said that he was the bravest man he ever had known billy recalled the yelling samurai with their keen swords and terrible spears he saw the little room in the palace of oda yorimoto and again he faced the brown devils who had hacked and hewed and stabbed at him that day as he fought to save the woman he loved coward what was there in this padded ring for a man to fear who had faced death as billy had faced it and without an instant's consciousness of the meaning of the word fear what was wrong with him and then the shouts and curses and taunts of the crowd smote upon his ears and he knew it was the crowd again the heavy fist of the coming champion brought billy to the mat and then before further damage could be done him the gong saved him it was a surprised and chastened mucker that walked with bent head to his corner after the first round the white hope was grinning and confident and so he returned to the center of the ring for the second round during the short interval billy had thrashed the whole thing out the crowd had gotten on his nerves he was trying to fight the whole crowd instead of just one man he would do better in this round but the first thing that happened after he faced his opponent sent the fans into delirious ecstasies of shouting and hooting billy swung his right for his foe's jaw a terrible blow that would have ended the fight had it landed but the man it and billy's momentum carried him sprawling upon his face when he regained his feet the white hope was waiting for him and billy went down again to lie there quite still while the hand of the referee marked the seconds one two three four five six billy opened his eyes seven billy sat up eight the meaning of that monotonous count finally percolated to the mucker's numbed perceptive faculties he was being counted out nine like a flash he was on his feet he had forgotten the crowd rage cool calculating rage possessed him not the feverish hysterical variety that takes its victim's brains away the reluctant dragon footprints in the snow have been unfailing provokers of sentiment ever since snow was first a white wonder in this world of ours in a presented to one of us by an aunt there was a poem by one wordsworth in which they stood out strongly with a picture all to themselves too but we didn't think very highly either of the poem or the sentiment footprints in the sand now were quite another matter and we grasped crusoe's attitude of mind much more easily than wordsworth's excitement and mystery curiosity and suspense these were the only sentiments that tracks whether in sand or in snow were able to arouse in us we had awakened early that winter morning puzzled at first by the added light that filled the room then when the truth at last fully dawned on us and we knew that was no longer a wistful dream but a solid certainty waiting for us outside it was a mere brute fight for the necessary clothes and the lacing of boots seemed a clumsy invention and the buttoning of coats an unduly tedious form of fastening with all that snow going to waste at our very door when came we had to be dragged in by the scruff of our necks the short armistice over the combat was resumed but presently charlotte and i a little weary of contests and of missiles that ran shudderingly down inside one's clothes forsook the trampled of the lawn and went exploring the blank virgin spaces of the white world that lay beyond it stretched away unbroken on every side of us this mysterious soft garment under which our familiar world had so suddenly hidden itself faint imprints showed where a casual bird had alighted but of other traffic there was next to no sign which made these strange tracks all the more puzzling we came across them first at the corner of the shrubbery and pored over them long our hands on our knees experienced trappers that we knew ourselves to be it was annoying to be brought up suddenly by a beast we could not at once identify don't you know said charlotte rather scornfully thought you knew all the beasts that ever was this put me on my mettle and i hastily rattled off a string of animal names embracing both the arctic and the tropic zones but without much real confidence no said charlotte on consideration they won't any of em quite do seems like something lizardy did you say a iguanodon might be that p'raps but that's not british and we want a real british beast i think it's a dragon t isn't half big enough i objected well all dragons must be small to begin with said charlotte like everything else p'raps this is a little dragon who's got lost a little dragon would be rather nice to have he might scratch and spit but he couldn't do anything really let's track him down so we set off into the wide world hand in hand our hearts big with expectation complacently confident that by a few smudgy traces in the snow we were in a fair way to capture a specimen of a fabulous beast we ran the monster across the paddock and along the hedge of the next field and then he took to the road like any tame civilized here his tracks became blended with and lost among more ordinary footprints but imagination and a fixed idea will do a great deal and we were sure we knew the direction a dragon would naturally take the traces too kept reappearing at intervals at least charlotte maintained they did and as it was her dragon i left the following of the slot to her and trotted along peacefully feeling that it was an expedition anyhow and something was sure to come out of it charlotte took me across another field or two and through a copse and into a fresh road and i began to feel sure it was only her confounded pride that made her go on pretending to see instead of owning she was entirely at fault like a reasonable person at last she dragged me excitedly through a gap in a hedge of an obviously private character the waste open world of field and disappeared and we found ourselves in a garden secluded most in appearance once inside i knew where we were this was the garden of my friend the though i had never approached it before by a lawless gap from this unfamiliar side and here was the himself placidly smoking a pipe as he strolled up and down the walks i stepped up to him and asked him politely if he had lately seen a beast may i inquire he said with all civility what particular sort of a beast you may happen to be looking for it's a lizardy sort of beast i explained charlotte says it's a dragon but she doesn't really know much about beasts the looked round about him slowly i don't think he said that i've seen a dragon in these parts recently but if i come across one i'll know it belongs to you and i'll have him taken round to you at once contents i a little ii drooping wings iii the bird's nest iv birds of a feather flock together v some other birds are taught to fly vi when the pie was opened the birds began to sing vii the birdling flies away the birds christmas carol i a little snow bird it was very early christmas morning and in the stillness of the dawn with the soft snow falling on the housetops a little child was born in the bird household they had intended to name the baby lucy if it were a girl but they hadn't expected her on christmas morning and a real christmas baby was not to be lightly named the whole family agreed in that they were consulting about it in the nursery mr bird said that he had assisted in naming the three boys and that he should leave this matter entirely to mrs bird donald wanted the child called maud after a pretty little girl who sat next him in school paul chose luella for luella was the nurse who had been with him during his whole babyhood up to the time of his first trousers and the name suggested all sorts of comfortable things uncle jack said that the first girl should always be named for her mother no matter how hideous the name happened to be grandma said that she would prefer not to take any part in the discussion and everybody suddenly remembered that mrs bird had thought of naming the baby lucy for grandma herself and while it would be indelicate for her to favor that name it would be against human nature for her to suggest any other under the circumstances hugh the hitherto baby if that is a possible term sat in one corner and said nothing but felt in some mysterious way that his nose was out of joint for there was a newer baby now a possibility he had never taken into consideration and the first girl too a still higher development of treason which made him actually green with jealousy but it was too profound a subject to be settled then and there on the spot besides mama had not been asked and everybody felt it rather absurd after all to forestall a decree that was certain to be absolutely wise just and perfect the reason that the subject had been brought up at all so early in the day lay in the fact that mrs bird never allowed her babies to go over night unnamed she was a person of so great decision of character that she would have blushed at such a thing she said that to let blessed babies go dangling and dawdling about without names for months and months was enough to ruin them for life she also said that if one could not make up one's mind in hours it was a sign that but i will not repeat the rest as it might prejudice you against the most charming woman in the world so donald took his new velocipede and went out to ride up and down the stone pavement and notch the shins of innocent people as they passed by while paul spun his musical top on the front steps but hugh refused to leave the scene of action he seated himself on the top stair in the hall banged his head against the railing a few times just by way of uncorking the vials of his wrath and then subsided into gloomy silence waiting to declare war if more first girl babies were thrust upon a family already surfeited with that unnecessary article meanwhile dear mrs bird lay in her room weak but safe and happy with her sweet girl baby by her side and the heaven of motherhood opening before her nurse was making gruel in the kitchen and the room was dim and quiet there was a cheerful open fire in the grate but though the shutters were closed the side windows that looked out on the church of our saviour next door were wide open suddenly a sound of music poured out into the bright air and drifted into the chamber it was the singing christmas anthems higher and higher rose the clear fresh voices full of hope and cheer as children's voices always are fuller and fuller grew the burst of melody as one glad strain fell upon another in joyful harmony carol brothers carol carol joyfully carol the good tidings carol merrily and pray a gladsome christmas for all your carol brothers carol christmas day again one verse followed another always with the same glad refrain and pray a gladsome christmas for all your carol brothers carol christmas day again mrs bird thought as the music floated in upon her gentle sleep that she had slipped into heaven with her new baby and that the angels were bidding them welcome but the tiny bundle by her side stirred a little and though it was scarcely more than the ruffling of a feather she awoke for the is so close to the heart that it can hear the faintest whisper of a child she opened her eyes and drew the baby closer it looked like a rose dipped in milk she thought this pink and white blossom of girlhood or like a pink cherub with its halo of pale yellow hair finer than floss silk man's reason there was one of the tribe of tarzan who questioned his authority and that was terkoz the son of tublat but he so feared the keen knife and the deadly arrows of his new lord that he confined the manifestation of his objections to petty disobediences and irritating mannerisms tarzan knew however that he but waited his opportunity to wrest the kingship from him by some sudden stroke of treachery and so he was ever on his guard against surprise for months the life of the little band went on much as it had before except that tarzan's greater intelligence and his ability as a hunter were the means of providing for them more bountifully than ever before most of them therefore were more than content with the change in rulers tarzan led them by night to the fields of the black men and there warned by their chief's superior wisdom they ate only what they required nor ever did they destroy what they could not eat as is the way of manu the monkey and of most apes so while the blacks were wroth at the continued pilfering of their fields they were not discouraged in their efforts to cultivate the land as would have been the case had tarzan permitted his people to lay waste the plantation wantonly during this period tarzan paid many nocturnal visits to the village where he often renewed his supply of arrows he soon noticed the food always standing at the foot of the tree which was his avenue into the palisade and after a little he commenced to eat whatever the blacks put there when the savages saw that the food disappeared overnight they were filled with consternation and dread for it was one thing to put food out to propitiate a god or a devil but quite another thing to have the spirit really come into the village and eat it such a thing was unheard of and it clouded their superstitious minds with all manner of vague fears nor was this all the periodic disappearance of their arrows and the strange pranks perpetrated by unseen hands had wrought them to such a state that life had become a veritable burden in their new home and now it was that mbonga and his head men began to talk of abandoning the village and seeking a site farther on in the jungle presently the black warriors began to strike farther and farther south into the heart of the forest when they went to hunt looking for a site for a new village more often was the tribe of tarzan disturbed by these wandering huntsmen now was the quiet fierce solitude of the primeval forest broken by new strange cries no longer was there safety for bird or beast man had come other animals passed up and down the jungle by day and by night fierce cruel beasts but their weaker neighbors only fled from their immediate vicinity to return again when the danger was past with man it is different when he comes many of the larger animals instinctively leave the district entirely seldom if ever to return and thus it has always been with the great anthropoids they flee man as man flees a pestilence for a short time the tribe of tarzan lingered in the vicinity of the beach because their new chief hated the thought of leaving the treasured contents of the little cabin forever but when one day a member of the tribe discovered the blacks in great numbers on the banks of a little stream that had been their watering place for generations and in the act of clearing a space in the jungle and erecting many huts the apes would remain no longer and so tarzan led them inland for many marches to a spot as yet undefiled by the foot of a human being once every moon tarzan would go swinging rapidly back through the swaying branches to have a day with his books and to replenish his supply of arrows this latter task was becoming more and more difficult for the blacks had taken to hiding their supply away at night in granaries and living huts this necessitated watching by day on tarzan's part to discover where the arrows were being concealed twice had he entered huts at night while the inmates lay sleeping upon their mats and stolen the arrows from the very sides of the warriors but this method he realized to be too fraught with danger and so he commenced picking up solitary hunters with his long deadly noose stripping them of weapons and ornaments and dropping their bodies from a high tree into the village street during the still watches of the night these various escapades again so terrorized the blacks that had it not been for the monthly respite between tarzan's visits in which they had opportunity to renew hope that each fresh incursion would prove the last they soon would have abandoned their new village the blacks had not as yet come upon tarzan's cabin on the distant beach but the lived in constant dread that while he was away with the tribe they would discover and despoil his treasure so it came that he spent more and more time in the vicinity of his father's last home and less and less with the tribe presently the members of his little community began to suffer on account of his neglect for disputes and quarrels constantly arose which only the king might settle peaceably the artist bah monsieur the old mountebank said to me it is a matter of exercise and habit that is all of course one requires to be a little gifted that way and not to be but what is chiefly necessary is patience and daily practice for long long years his modesty surprised me all the more because of all performers who are generally infatuated with their own skill he was the most wonderfully clever one i had met certainly i had frequently seen him for everybody had seen him in some circus or other or even in traveling shows performing the trick that consists of putting a man or woman with extended arms against a wooden target and in throwing knives between their fingers and round their heads from a distance there is nothing very extraordinary in it after all when one knows the tricks of the trade and that the knives are not the least sharp and stick into the wood at some distance from the flesh it is the rapidity of the throws the glitter of the blades and the curve which the handles make toward their living object which give an air of danger to an exhibition that has become commonplace and only requires very middling skill but here there was no trick and no deception and no dust thrown into the eyes it was done in good earnest and in all sincerity the knives were as sharp as razors and the old mountebank planted them close to the flesh exactly in the angle between the fingers he surrounded the head with a perfect halo of knives and the neck with a collar from which nobody could have extricated himself without cutting his carotid artery while to increase the difficulty the old fellow went through the performance without seeing his whole face being covered with a close mask of thick oilcloth naturally like other great artists he was not understood by the crowd who confounded him with vulgar tricksters and his mask only appeared to them a trick the more and a very common trick into the bargain he must think us very stupid they said how could he possibly aim without having his eyes open and they thought there must be imperceptible holes in the oilcloth a sort of latticework concealed in the material it was useless for him to allow the public to examine the mask for themselves before the exhibition began it was all very well that they could not discover any trick but they were only all the more convinced that they were being tricked did not the people know that they ought to be tricked i had recognized a great artist in the old mountebank and i was quite sure that he was altogether incapable of any trickery i told him so while expressing my admiration to him and he had been touched by my open admiration and above all by the justice i had done him thus we became good friends and he explained to me very modestly the real trick which the crowd do not understand the eternal trick contained in these simple words to be gifted by nature and to practice every day for long long years he had been especially struck by the certainty which i expressed that any trickery must become impossible to him yes he said to me quite impossible impossible to a degree which you cannot imagine if i were to tell you but where would be the use his face clouded over and his eyes filled with tears i did not venture to force myself into his confidence my looks however were not so discreet as my silence and begged him to speak so he responded to their mute appeal after all he said why should i not tell you about it you will understand me and he added with a look of sudden ferocity she understood it at any rate who i asked my strumpet of a wife he replied ah monsieur what an abominable creature she was if you only knew yes she understood it too well too well and that is why i hate her so even more on that account than for having deceived me for that is a natural fault is it not and may be pardoned but the other thing was a crime a horrible crime the woman who stood against the wooden target every night with her arms stretched out and her finger extended and whom the old mountebank fitted with gloves and with a halo formed of his knives which were as sharp as razors and which he planted close to her was his wife she might have been a woman of forty and must have been fairly pretty but with a perverse prettiness she had an impudent mouth a mouth that was at the same time sensual and bad with the lower lip too thick for the thin dry upper lip i had several times noticed that every time he planted a knife in the board she uttered a laugh so low as scarcely to be heard but which was very significant when one heard it for it was a hard and very mocking laugh i had always attributed that sort of reply to an artifice which the occasion required it was intended i thought to accentuate the danger she incurred and the contempt that she felt for it thanks to the sureness of the thrower's hands and so i was very much surprised when the mountebank said to me chapter xviii a settler in cloisterham at about this time a stranger appeared in cloisterham a personage with black eyebrows being buttoned up in a tightish blue surtout with a buff waistcoat and gray trousers he had something of a military air but he announced himself at the crozier the orthodox hotel where he put up with a portmanteau as an idle dog who lived upon his means and he farther announced that he had a mind to take a lodging in the picturesque old city for a month or two with a view of settling down there altogether both announcements were made in the of the crozier to all whom it might or might not concern by the stranger as he stood with his back to the empty fireplace waiting for his fried sole veal cutlet and pint of sherry and the waiter business being chronically slack at the crozier represented all whom it might or might not concern and absorbed the whole of the information this white head was unusually large and his shock of white hair was unusually thick and ample i suppose waiter he said shaking his shock of hair as a newfoundland dog might shake his before sitting down to dinner that a fair lodging for a single buffer might be found in these parts eh the waiter had no doubt of it something old said the gentleman take my hat down for a moment from that peg will you no i want it look into it what do you see written there the waiter read datchery now you know my name said the gentleman dick datchery hang it up again i was saying something old is what i should prefer something odd and out of the way something venerable architectural and inconvenient we have a good choice of inconvenient lodgings in the town sir i think replied the waiter with modest confidence in its resources that way indeed i have no doubt that we could suit you that far however particular you might be but a architectural lodging that seemed to trouble the head and he shook it anything cathedraly now mr datchery suggested mr tope said the waiter brightening as he rubbed his chin with his hand would be the likeliest party to inform in that line who is mr tope inquired dick datchery the waiter explained that he was the verger and that mrs tope had indeed once upon a time let lodgings herself or offered to let them but that as nobody had ever taken them mrs long a cloisterham institution had disappeared probably had tumbled down one day and never been put up again call on mrs tope said mr datchery after dinner so when he had done his dinner he was duly directed to the spot and sallied out for it but the crozier being an hotel of a most retiring disposition and the directions being fatally precise he soon became bewildered and went boggling about and about the cathedral tower whenever he could catch a glimpse of it with a general impression on his mind that mrs was somewhere very near it and that like the children in the game of hot boiled beans and very good butter he was warm in his search when he saw the tower and cold when he see it he was getting very cold indeed when he came upon a fragment of in which an unhappy sheep was grazing unhappy because a hideous small boy was stoning it through the railings and had already lamed it in one leg and was much excited by the benevolent sportsmanlike purpose of breaking its other three legs and bringing it down it im agin cried the boy as the poor creature leaped and made a dint in his wool let him be said mr datchery you see you have lamed him yer lie returned the sportsman e went and lamed isself i see im do it and i giv im a shy as a to im not to go is mutton any more come here i come when yer can ketch me stay there then and show me which is mr ow can i stay here and show you which is topeseses when topeseses is side the kinfreederal and over the crossings and round ever so many comers show me where it is and give you something come on then this brisk dialogue concluded the boy led the way and stopped at some distance from an arched passage pointing lookie yonder you see that there winder and door yer lie it indeed said mr datchery with a second look of some interest yes and i no nearer im i tell yer why not cos i to be lifted off my legs and ave my braces bust and be choked not if i knows it and not by im wait till i set a jolly good flint at the back o is jolly old ed some day now look side the harch not the side where door is side i see a little way in o that side a low door down two steps topeseses with is name on a hoval plate chapter seventeen martin enlarges his circle of aquaintance increases his stock of wisdom and has an excellent opportunity of comparing his own experiences with those of lummy ned of the light salisbury as related by his friend mr william simmons it was characteristic of martin that all this while he had either forgotten mark tapley as completely as if there had been no such person in existence or if for a moment the figure of that gentleman rose before his mental vision had dismissed it as something by no means of a pressing nature which might be attended to and could wait his perfect leisure but being now in the streets again it occurred to him as just coming within the bare limits of possibility that mr tapley might in course of time grow tired of waiting on the threshold of the rowdy journal office so he intimated to his new friend that if they could conveniently walk in that direction he would be glad to get this piece of business off his mind and speaking of business said martin may i ask in order that i may not be with questions either whether your occupation holds you to this city or like myself you are a visitor here a visitor replied his friend i was raised in the state of massachusetts and reside there still my home is in a quiet country town i am not often in these busy places and my inclination to visit them does not increase with our better acquaintance i assure you you have been abroad asked martin oh yes and like most people who travel have become more than ever attached to your home and native country said martin eyeing him curiously to my home yes rejoined his friend to my native country as my home yes also you imply some reservation said martin well returned his new friend if you ask me whether i came back here with a greater relish for my faults with a greater fondness for those who claim at the rate of so many dollars a day to be her friends with a cooler indifference to the growth of principles among us in respect of public matters and of private dealings between man and man the advocacy of which beyond the foul atmosphere of a criminal trial would disgrace your own old bailey lawyers why then i answer plainly no oh said martin in so exactly the same key as his no that it sounded like an echo if you ask me his companion pursued whether i came back here better satisfied with a state of things which broadly divides society into two classes whereof one the great mass asserts a spurious independence most miserably dependent for its mean existence on the disregard of humanizing conventionalities of manner and social custom so that the coarser a man is the more distinctly it shall appeal to his taste while the other disgusted with the low standard thus set up and made adaptable to everything takes refuge among the graces and refinements it can bring to bear on private life and leaves the public weal to such fortune as may betide it in the press and uproar of a general scramble then again i answer no and again martin said oh in the same odd way as before being anxious and disconcerted not so much to say the truth on public grounds as with reference to the fading prospects of domestic architecture in a word resumed the other i do not find and cannot believe and therefore will not allow that we are a model of wisdom and an example to the world and the perfection of human reason and a great deal more to the same purpose which you may hear any hour in the day simply because we began our political life with two inestimable advantages what were they asked martin one that our history commenced at so late a period as to escape the ages of bloodshed and cruelty through which other nations have passed and so had all the light of their probation and none of its darkness the other that we have a vast territory and not as yet too many people on it these facts considered we have done little enough i think education suggested martin faintly pretty well on that head said the other shrugging his shoulders still no mighty matter to boast of for old countries and despotic countries too have done as much if not more and made less noise about it we shine out brightly in comparison with england certainly but hers is a very extreme case you complimented me on my frankness you know he added laughing oh i am not at all astonished at your speaking thus openly when my country is in question returned martin it is your in reference to your own that surprises me you will not find it a scarce quality here i assure you saving among the colonel divers and jefferson bricks and major pawkinses though the best of us are something like the man in comedy who suffer anybody but himself to abuse his master come he added let us talk of something else you have come here on some design of improving your fortune i dare say and i should grieve to put you out of heart i am some years older than you besides and may on a few trivial points advise you perhaps chapter for some reason or other the house was crowded that night and the fat jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with an oily tremulous smile he escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top of his voice dorian gray loathed him more than ever he felt as if he had come to look for miranda and had been met by caliban lord henry upon the other hand rather liked him at least he declared he did and insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a poet hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit the heat was terribly oppressive and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire the youths in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side they talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them some women were laughing in the pit their voices were horribly shrill and discordant the sound of the popping of corks came from the bar what a place to find one's divinity in said lord henry yes answered dorian gray it was here i found her and she is divine beyond all living things when she acts you will forget everything these common rough people with their coarse faces and brutal gestures become quite different when she is on the stage they sit silently and watch her they weep and laugh as she wills them to do she makes them as responsive as a violin she spiritualizes them and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one's self the same flesh and blood as one's self oh i hope not exclaimed lord henry who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his don't pay any attention to him dorian said the painter i understand what you mean and i believe in this girl any one you love must be marvellous and any girl who has the effect you describe must be fine and noble to spiritualize one's age that is something worth doing if this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and ugly if she can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own she is worthy of all your adoration worthy of the adoration of the world this marriage is quite right i did not think so at first but i admit it now the gods made sibyl vane for you without her you would have been incomplete thanks basil answered dorian gray pressing his hand i knew that you would understand me harry is so cynical he terrifies me but here is the orchestra it is quite dreadful but it only lasts for about five minutes then the curtain rises and you will see the girl to whom i am going to give all my life to whom i have given everything that is good in me a quarter of an hour afterwards amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause sibyl vane stepped on to the stage yes she was certainly lovely to look at one of the loveliest creatures lord henry thought that he had ever seen there was something of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes a faint blush like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded enthusiastic house she stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to tremble basil hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud motionless and as one in a dream sat dorian gray gazing at her lord henry peered through his glasses murmuring charming charming the scene was the hall of capulet's house and romeo in his pilgrim's dress had entered with mercutio and his other friends the band such as it was struck up a few bars of music and the dance began through the crowd of ungainly shabbily dressed actors sibyl vane moved like a creature from a finer world her body swayed while she danced as a plant sways in the water the curves of her throat were the curves of a white lily her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory yet she was curiously listless she showed no sign of joy when her eyes rested on romeo the few words she had to speak good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much which mannerly devotion shows in this for saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch and palm to palm is holy palmers kiss with the brief dialogue that follows were spoken in a thoroughly artificial manner the voice was exquisite but from the point of view of tone it was absolutely false it was wrong in colour it took away all the life from the verse it made the passion unreal chapter seven it is dark here in the forest the leaves rustle over our head black against the last gold of the sky the moss is soft and warm we shall sleep on this moss for many nights till the beasts of the forest come to tear our body we have no bed now save the moss and no future save the beasts we are old now yet we were young this morning when we carried our glass box through the streets of the city to the home of the scholars no men stopped us for there were none about from the palace of corrective detention and the others knew nothing no men stopped us at the gate we walked through the empty passages and into the great hall where the world council of scholars sat in solemn meeting we saw nothing as we entered save the sky in the great windows blue and glowing then we saw the scholars who sat around a long table they were as shapeless clouds huddled at the rise of the a great sky there were the men whose famous names we knew and others from distant lands whose names we had not heard we saw a great painting on the wall over their heads of the twenty illustrious men who had invented the candle all the heads of the council turned to us as we entered these great and wise of the earth did not know what to think of us and they looked upon us with wonder and curiosity as if we were a miracle it is true that our tunic was torn and stained with brown stains which had been blood we raised our right arm and we said our greeting to you our honored brothers of the world council of scholars then collective the oldest and wisest of the council spoke and asked who are you our brother for you do not look like a scholar our name is equality equity we answered and we are a street sweeper of this city then is it was as if a great wind had stricken the hall for all the scholars spoke at once and they were angry and frightened a street sweeper a street sweeper walking in upon the world council of scholars it is not to be believed it is against all the rules and all the laws but we knew how to stop them our brothers we said we matter not nor our transgression it is only our brother men who matter give no thought to us for we are nothing but listen to our words for we bring you a gift such as had has never been brought to men listen to us for we hold the future of mankind in our hands then they listened we placed our glass box upon on the table before them we spoke of it and of our long quest and of our tunnel and of our escape from the palace of corrective detention not a hand moved in that hall as we spoke nor an eye then we put the wires to the box and they all bent forward and sat still watching and we stood still our eyes upon the wire and slowly slowly as a flush of blood a red flame trembled in the wire then the wire glowed but terror struck the men of the council they leapt to their feet they ran from the table and they stood pressed against the wall huddled together seeking the warmth of one another's bodies to give them courage we looked upon them and we laughed and said fear nothing our brothers there is a great power in these wires but this power is tamed it is yours we give it to you still they would not move we give you the power of the sky we cried we give you the key to the earth take it and let us be one of you the humblest among you let us all work together and harness this power and make it ease the toil of men let us throw away our candles and our torches let us flood our cities with light let us bring a new light to men but they looked upon us and suddenly we were afraid for their eyes were still and small and evil our brothers we cried have you nothing to say to us then collective moved forward they moved to the table and the others followed yes spoke collective we have much to say to you the sound of their voices voice brought silence to the hall and to be the beat of our heart yes said collective we have much to say to a wretch who have broken all the laws and who boast of their infamy how dared you think that your mind held greater wisdom that than the minds of your brothers and if the councils council had decreed that you should be a street sweeper how dared you think that you could be of greater use to men than in sweeping the streets how dared you gutter cleaner spoke fraternity to hold yourself as one alone and with the thoughts of the one and not of the many chapter ii roderick early on the morrow rowland received a visit from his new friend roderick was in a state of extreme exhilaration tempered however by a certain amount of righteous wrath he had had a domestic struggle but he had remained master of the situation he had shaken the dust of mr office from his feet i had it out last night with my mother he said i dreaded the scene for she takes things terribly hard she scold nor storm and she argue nor insist she sits with her eyes full of tears that never fall and looks at me when i displease her as if i were a perfect monster of depravity and the trouble is that i was born to displease her she trust me she never has and she never will i know what i have done to set her against me but ever since i can remember i have been looked at with tears the trouble is he went on giving a twist to his moustache i ve been too absurdly docile i ve been sprawling all my days by the maternal fireside and my dear mother has grown used to bullying me i ve made myself cheap if i m not in my bed by eleven the girl is sent out to explore with a lantern when i think of it i fairly despise my amiability it s rather a hard fate to live like a saint and to pass for a sinner i should like for six months to lead mrs hudson the life some fellows lead their mothers allow me to believe said rowland that you would like nothing of the sort if you have been a good boy spoil it by pretending you like it you have been very happy i suspect in spite of your virtues and there are worse fates in the world than being loved too well i have not had the pleasure of seeing your mother but i would lay you a wager that that is the trouble she is passionately fond of you and her hopes like all intense hopes keep trembling into fears rowland as he spoke had an instinctive vision of how such a beautiful young fellow must be loved by his female relatives roderick frowned and with an impatient gesture i do her justice he cried may she never do me less then after a hesitation i ll tell you the perfect truth he went on i have to fill a double place i have to be my brother as well as myself it s a good deal to ask of a man especially when he has so little talent as i for being what he is not when we were both young together i was the curled darling i had the silver mug and the biggest piece of pudding and i stayed to be kissed by the ladies while he made in the garden and was never missed of course really he was worth fifty of me when he was brought home from vicksburg with a piece of shell in his skull my poor mother began to think she loved him enough i remember as she hung round my neck sobbing before his coffin she told me that i must be to her everything that he would have been i swore in tears and in perfect good faith that i would but naturally i have not kept my promise i have been utterly different i have been idle restless egotistical discontented i have done no harm i believe but i have done no good my brother if he had lived would have made fifty thousand dollars and put gas and water into the house my mother brooding night and day on her bereavement has come to fix her ideal in offices of that sort judged by that standard i m nowhere rowland was at loss how to receive this account of his domestic circumstances it was plaintive and yet the manner seemed to him you must lose no time in making a masterpiece he answered then with the proceeds you can give her gas from golden burners so i have told her but she only half believes either in masterpiece or in proceeds she can see no good in my making statues they seem to her a snare of the enemy she would fain see me all my life tethered to the law like a browsing goat to a stake in that way i m in sight it s a more regular occupation that s all i can get out of her a more regular damnation is it a fact that artists in general are such wicked men i never had the pleasure of knowing one so i confute her with an example she had the advantage of me because she formerly knew a at richmond who did her miniature in black lace mittens you may see it on the parlor table who used to drink raw brandy and beat his wife i promised her that whatever i might do to my wife i would never beat my mother and that as for brandy raw or diluted i detested it she sat silently crying for an hour during which i expended treasures of eloquence it s a good thing to have to reckon up intentions and i assure you as i pleaded my cause i was most agreeably impressed with the elevated character of my own i kissed her solemnly at last and told her that i had said everything and that she must make the best of

on lambing flat the pipe clays gulgong home rule and so through the roaring list in bark huts tents sly grog shanties and well the most glorious voice of all belonged to a bad girl we were only children and didn't know why she was bad but we weren't allowed to play near or go near the hut she lived in and we were trained to believe firmly that something awful would happen to us if we stayed to answer a word and didn't run away as fast as our legs could carry us if she attempted to speak to us we had before us the dread example of one urchin who got an awful hiding and went on bread and water for hours for allowing her to kiss him and give him lollies she didn't look bad she looked to us like a grand and beautiful but we got instilled into us the idea that she was an awful bad woman something more terrible even than a drunken man and one whose presence was to be feared and fled from there were two other girls in the hut with her also a pretty little girl who called her auntie and with whom we were not allowed to play for they were all bad which puzzled us as much as can be puzzled we couldn't make out how everybody in one house could be bad we used to wonder why these bad people weren't hunted away or put in gaol if they were so bad and another thing puzzled us slipping out after dark when the bad girls happened to be singing in their house we'd sometimes run against men hanging round the hut by ones and twos and threes listening they seemed mysterious they were mostly good men and we concluded they were listening and watching the bad women's house to see that they didn't kill anyone or steal and run away with any bad little boys ourselves for instance who ran out after dark which as we were informed those bad people were always on the lookout for a chance to do we were told in after years that old peter mckenzie a respectable married digger would sometimes steal up opposite the bad door in the dark and throw in money done up in a piece of paper and listen round until the bad girl had sung the bonnie hills of scotland two or three times then he'd go and get drunk and stay drunk two or three days at a time and his wife caught him throwing the money in one night and there was a terrible row and she left him and people always said it was all a mistake but we couldn't see the mistake then but i can hear that girl's voice through the night twenty years ago oh the bloomin heath and the pale blue bell in my bonnet then i wore and memory knows no brighter theme than those happy days of yore scotland land of chief and song oh what charms to thee belong and i am old enough to understand why poor peter mckenzie who was married to a saxon and a tartar went and got drunk when the bad girl sang the bonnie hills of scotland his anxious eye might look in vain for some loved form it knew and yet another thing puzzled us greatly at the time next door to the bad girl's house there lived a very respectable family a family of good girls with whom we were allowed to play and from whom we got lollies those hard old fish lollies that grocers sent home with parcels of groceries and receipted bills now one washing day they being as glad to get rid of us at home as we were to get out we went over to the good house and found no one at home except the daughter who used to sing for us and read robinson crusoe of nights out loud and give us more lollies than any of the rest and with whom we were passionately in love notwithstanding the fact that she was engaged to a man we reckoned he'd be dead and out of the way by the time we were old enough to marry her she was washing she had carried the stool and tub over against the stick fence which separated her house from the bad house and to our astonishment and dismay the bad girl had brought her tub over against her side of the fence they stood and worked with their shoulders to the fence between them and heads bent down close to it the bad girl would sing a few words and the good girl after her over and over again they sang very low we thought presently the good girl turned her head and caught sight of us she jumped and her face went flaming red she laid hold of the stool and carried it tub and all away from that fence in a hurry and the bad girl took her tub back to her house the good girl made us promise never to tell what we saw that she'd been talking to a bad girl else she would never never marry us gloriana willow shaw the little fenced wood where the are stacked like indian wigwams had been given to dan and una for their very own kingdom when they were quite small as they grew older they contrived to keep it most particularly private even phillips the gardener told them every time that he came in to take a for his beans and old hobden would no more have thought of setting his there without leave given fresh each spring than he would have torn down the calico and marking ink notice on the big willow which said not allowed in the kingdom unless brought now you can understand their indignation when one blowy july afternoon as they were going up for a they saw somebody moving among the trees they hurled themselves over the gate dropping half the potatoes and while they were picking them up puck came out of a wigwam oh you is it said una we thought it was people i saw you were angry from your legs he answered with a grin well our own kingdom not counting you of course rather why i came a lady here wants to see you what about said dan cautiously oh just kingdoms and things she knows about kingdoms there was a lady near the fence dressed in a long dark cloak that hid everything except her high shoes her face was half covered by a black silk fringed mask without goggles and yet she did not look in the least as if she motored puck led them up to her and bowed solemnly una made the best curtsy she could remember the lady answered with a long deep slow billowy one since it seems that you are a queen of this kingdom she said i can do no less than acknowledge your sovereignty she turned sharply on staring dan in your head lad manners i was thinking how wonderfully you did that curtsy he answered she laughed a rather shrill laugh a courtier already do you know anything of dances wench or queen must i say had some lessons but i really dance a bit said una you should learn then the lady moved forward as though she would teach her at once it gives a woman alone among men or her enemies time to think how she shall win or lose a woman can only work in heigho she sat down on the bank old middenboro the pony stumped across the paddock and hung his sorrowful head over the fence a pleasant kingdom said the lady looking round well enclosed and how does your majesty govern it who is your minister una did not quite understand we play that she said play the lady threw up her hands and laughed we have it for our own together dan explained and never quarrel young burleigh sometimes but then we tell the lady nodded no brats of my own but i understand keeping a secret between queens and their ministers ay de mi but with no disrespect to present majesty methinks your realm small and therefore likely to be coveted by man and beast for is example she pointed to middenboro yonder old horse with the face of a spanish friar does he never break in he old hobden stops all our gaps for us said una and we let hobden catch rabbits in the shaw the lady laughed like a man i see hobden catches conies rabbits for himself and guards your defences for you does he make a profit out of his we never ask said una a particular friend of ours the lady began angrily then she laughed but i forget it is your kingdom i knew a maid once that had a larger one than this to defend and so long as her men kept the fences stopped she asked em no questions either was she trying to grow flowers said una no trees perdurable trees her flowers all withered the lady leaned her head on her hand they do if you look after them got a few would you like to see fetch you some una ran off to the rank grass in the shade behind the wigwam and came back with a handful of red flowers they pretty she said virginia stock virginia said the lady and lifted them to the fringe of her mask yes they come from virginia did your maid ever plant any not herself but her men adventured all over the earth to pluck or to plant flowers for her crown they judged her worthy of them and was she said dan cheerfully quien sabe who knows but at least while her men toiled abroad she toiled in england that they might find a safe home to come back to and what was she called gloriana belphoebe elizabeth of england her voice changed at each word you mean queen bess the lady bowed her head a little towards dan you name her lightly enough young burleigh what might you know of her said she well i seen the little green shoes she left at brickwall house down the road you know in a glass case awfully tiny things oh burleigh burleigh she laughed you are a courtier too soon an old house and its bachelor when the knell of my thirtieth birthday sounded i suddenly realised with a desolate feeling at the heart that i was alone in the world it was true i had many and good friends and i was blessed with interests and occupations which i had often declared sufficient to satisfy any not too exacting human being moreover a small but sufficient competency was mine allowing me reasonable comforts and the luxuries of a small but choice library and a small but choice garden these heavenly blessings had seemed mere than enough for nearly five years during which the good sister and i had kept house together leading a life of tranquil happy days friends and books and flowers it was we said a good world and i simpleton pretty and dainty as margaret was deemed it would go on forever but alas one day came a faust into our garden a good faust with no friend mephistopheles and took margaret from me it is but a month since they were married and the rice still lingers in the crevices of the pathway down to the quaint old gate yes they have gone off to spend their honeymoon and margaret has written to me twice to say how happy they are together in the hesperides dear happiness selfish indeed were he who would envy you one petal of that wonderful rose rosa mundi god has given you to gather but all the same the reader will admit that it must be lonely for me and not another sister left to take pity on me all somewhere happily settled down in the fortunate isles poor lonely old house do you too miss the light step of your mistress no longer shall her little silken figure flit up and down your quiet staircases no more deck out your silent rooms with flowers humming the while some happy little song the little piano is dumb night after night its candles unlighted and there is no one to play chopin to us now as the day dies and the shadows stoop out of their corners to listen in vain old house old house we are alone quite alone there is no mistake about that and the soul has gone out of both of us and as for the garden there is no company there that is loneliest of all the very sunlight looks desolation falling through the as through the chinks and crevices of deserted egyptian cities while as for the books well never talk to me again about the companionship of books for just when one needs them most of all they seem suddenly to have grown dull and unsympathetic not a word of comfort not a charm anywhere in them to make us forget the hours whereas when margaret was here but it is of no use to say any more everything was quite different when margaret was here that is enough margaret has gone away to the fortunate isles of course she'll come to see us now and again but it won't be the same thing yes old echoing silent house of joy that is gone we are quite alone now what is to be done chapter ii in which i decide to go on pilgrimage though i have this bad habit of soliloquising and indeed am absurd enough to attempt conversation with a house yet the reader must realise from the beginning that i am still quite a young man i talked a little just now as though i were an octogenarian actually as i said i am but just gone thirty and i may reasonably regard life as the saying is all before me i was a little when i wrote yesterday besides i wrote at the end of the afternoon a melancholy time the morning is the time to write we are all that is those of us who sleep well optimists in the morning and the world is sad enough without our writing books to make it sadder the rest of this book i promise you shall be written of a morning this book oh yes i forgot i am going to write a book a book about what well that must be as god wills but listen as i lay in bed this morning between sleeping and waking an idea came riding on a sunbeam into my room a mad whimsical idea but one that suits my mood and put briefly it is this how is it that i a not unpresentable young man a man not without accomplishments or experience should have gone all these years without finding that not impossible she who shall command my heart and me without meeting at some turning of the way the mystical golden girl without in short finding a wife then suggested the idea with a blush for its own absurdity why not go on pilgrimage and seek her i don't believe you'll find her she isn't usually found after thirty but you'll no doubt have good fun by the way and fall in with many pleasant adventures a brave idea indeed i cried by heaven i will take stick and knapsack and walk right away from my own front door right away where the road leads and see what happens and now if the reader please we will make a start iii the brother and sister dined alone clayton was finding his club a more comfortable place than his home in those days of his wife's disillusionment and hesitation about the future many weak creatures are curiously armed for the unequal conflict of existence some with fleetness of foot some with a weapon of malignance some with porcupine quills some with a possumlike instinct for playing dead of these last was fitzhugh he knew when to be silent when to keep out of the way when to sit tight and wait his wife had discovered that he was a fool that he perhaps owed more to his tailor than to any other single factor for the success of his splendid pose of the thorough gentleman yet she did not realize what an utter fool he was so clever had he been in the use of the art of discreet silence norman suspected him but could not believe a human being capable of such fathomless vacuity as he found whenever he tried to explore his brain after dinner norman took ursula to the opera to join the seldins and after the first act went to josephine who had come with only a deaf old aunt josephine loved music and to hear an opera from a box one must be alone norman entered as the lights went up it always gave him a feeling of dilation this spectacle of material splendor the women whose part it is throughout civilization to wear for public admiration and envy the evidences of the prowess of the males to whom they belong a truer version of dr holmes's aphorism would be that it takes several generations in oil to make a snob wholly to destroy a man's or a woman's point of view sense of the kinship of all flesh and to make him or her over into the genuine believer in caste and worshiper of it for all his keenness of mind of humor norman had the snobbishness of his family and friends he knew that caste was silly that such displays as this vulgar flaunting of jewels and costly dresses were in atrocious bad taste but it is one thing to know another thing to feel and his feeling was delight in the spectacle pride in his own high rank in the aristocracy his eyes rested with radiant pleasure on the girl he was to marry and she was indeed a person to appeal to the passion of pride simply and most expensively dressed in pearl satin with only a little jewelry she sat in the front of her parterre box a queen by right of her father's wealth her family's position her own beauty she was a large woman tall a big frame but not ungainly she had brilliant dark eyes a small proud head set upon shoulders that were slenderly young now and even when they should became matronly would still be beautiful she had good teeth an exquisite smile the gentle good humor of those who comfortable themselves would not have the slightest objection to all others being equally so because she laughed appreciatively and repeated amusingly she had great reputation for wit because she industriously picked up from men a plausible smatter of small talk about politics religion art and the like she was renowned as clever verging on profound and she believed herself both witty and wise as do thousands male and female with far less excuse she had selected norman for the same reason that he had selected her each recognized the other as the grand prize pity is not nearly so close kin to love as is the feeling that the other person satisfies to the uttermost all one's pet vanities it would have been next door to impossible for two people so well matched not to find themselves drawn to each other and filled with sympathy and the sense of comradeship so far as there can be comradeship where two are driving luxuriously along the way of life with not a serious cause for worry people without half the general fitness of these two for each other have gone through to the end regarding themselves and regarded as the most devoted of lovers indeed they were lovers only one of those savage tests to which in all probability they would never be exposed would or could reveal just how much or how little that vague variable word lovers meant when applied to them as their eyes met into each pair leaped the fine exalted light of pride in possession this wonderful woman is mine his eyes said and her eyes answered and you you most wonderful of men you are mine it always gave each of them a thrill like intoxication to meet after a day's separation all the joy of their dazzling good fortune burst upon them afresh i'll venture you haven't thought of me the whole day said she as he dropped to the chair behind her it was a remark she often made to give him the opportunity to say i've thought of little else i'm sorry to say i who have a career to look after he made the usual answer and they smiled happily at each other and you he said oh i what else has a woman to think about in the andes professor swyington bumper seemed to live in a region all by himself though he was on board the bellaconda he might just as well have been in an airship or riding along on the back of a donkey as far as his knowledge or recognition of his surroundings went he seemed to be thinking thoughts far far away and he was never without a book either a bound volume or a in the former he buried his nose and tom looking over his shoulder once saw that the book was printed in curious characters which later he learned were sanskrit if he had a the professor was continually jotting down memoranda in it i can hardly think of him as a conspirator against us said tom to mr titus after you have been in the contracting business as long as i have you'll distrust every one was the answer waddington isn't on board or i'd distrust him that spaniard senor pinto seems to be out of consideration and there only remains the professor we must watch him but professor bumper proved to be above suspicion carefully guarded inquiries made of the captain the purser and other ships officers brought out the fact that he was well known to all of them having traveled on the line before he is making a search for something but he won't say what it is the captain said at first we thought it was gold or jewels for he goes away off into the andes mountains where both gold and jewels have been found he never looks for treasure though for though some of his party have made rather rich discoveries he takes no interest in them what is he after then asked mr titus no one knows and he won't tell but whatever it is he has never found it yet always when he comes back unsuccessful from a trip to the interior and goes back north with us he will remark that he has not the right directions that he must seek again back he comes next season as full of hope as before but only to be disappointed each time he goes to a new place in the mountains where he digs and delves so members of the parties he hires tell me but with no success he carries with him something in a small iron box and whatever this is he consults it from time to time it may be directions for finding whatever he is after but there seems to be something wrong this is quite a mystery remarked tom it certainly is but professor bumper is a fine man i have known him for years this seems to dispose of the theory that he planted the bomb and that he is one of the plotters in the pay of blakeson grinder said mr titus when he and tom were alone yes i guess it does but who can have done it that was a question neither could answer tom had a theory which he did not disclose to mr titus that after all the somewhat mysterious senor pinto might in some way be mixed up in the bomb attempt but a close questioning of the steward on duty near the foreigner's cabin at the time disclosed the fact that pinto had been ill in his berth all that day well unless the bomb fell from some passing airship i don't see how it got on deck said tom with a shake of his head and i'm sure no airship passed over us they had kept the matter secret not telling even mr damon for they feared the eccentric man would make a fuss and alarm the whole vessel so mr damon occasionally blessing his necktie or his shoe laces played chess with his elderly gentleman friend and was perfectly happy that professor bumper not only had kept his promise about not mentioning the bomb but that he had forgotten all about it was evident a day or two after the happening tom and mr titus passed him on deck and bowed cordially the professor returned the salutation but looked at the two in a puzzled sort of fashion i beg your pardon he remarked but your faces are familiar though i cannot recall your names haven't i seen you before you have said tom with a smile you saved our lives from a bomb the other day oh yes so i did so i did exclaimed professor bumper i felt sure i had seen you before are you all right yes there haven't been any more bombs thrown at us the contractor said by the way professor bumper i understand you are quite a traveler in the andes in the vicinity of lima yes i have been there admitted the scientist in guarded tones well i am digging a tunnel in that vicinity went on mr titus and if you ever get near rimac where the first cutting is made i wish you would come and see me tom too as he is associated with me murmured the professor looking sharply at the contractor digging a tunnel there why are you doing that and he seemed to resent the idea why the peruvian government engaged me to do it to connect the two railroad lines was the answer do you know anything about the place le premier pas that night he told me the story of his earliest crime not since the fateful morning of the ides of march when he had just mentioned it as an unreported incident of a certain cricket tour had i succeeded in getting a word out of raffles on the subject it was not for want of trying he would shake his head and watch his cigarette smoke thoughtfully a subtle look in his eyes half cynical half wistful as though the decent honest days that were no more had had their merits after all raffles would plan a fresh enormity or glory in the last with the unmitigated enthusiasm of the artist it was impossible to imagine one throb or twitter of compunction beneath those frankly egotistic and infectious transports and yet the ghost of a dead remorse seemed still to visit him with the memory of his first felony so that i had given the story up long before the night of our return from milchester cricket however was in the air and raffles's back where he sometimes kept it in the fender with the remains of an orient label still adhering to the leather my eyes had been on this label for some time and i suppose his eyes had been on mine for all at once he asked me if i still burned to hear that yarn it's no use i replied you won't spin it i must imagine it for myself how can you oh i begin to know your methods you take it i went in with my eyes open as i do now eh i can't imagine your doing otherwise my dear bunny it was the most unpremeditated thing i ever did in my life his chair wheeled back into the books as he sprang up with sudden energy there was quite an indignant glitter in his eyes i can't believe that said i craftily i can't pay you such a poor compliment then you must be a fool he broke off stared hard at me and in a trice stood smiling in his own despite or a better knave than i thought you bunny and by jove it's the knave well i suppose i'm fairly drawn i give you best as they say out there as a matter of fact i've been thinking of the thing myself last night's racket reminds me of it in one or two respects i tell you what though this is an occasion in any case and i'm going to celebrate it by breaking the one good rule of my life i'm going to have a second drink the whiskey tinkled the syphon fizzed the ice plopped home and seated there in his pyjamas with the inevitable cigarette raffles told me the story that i had given up hoping to hear the windows were wide open the sounds of piccadilly floated in at first long before he finished the last wheels had rattled the last brawler was removed we alone broke the quiet of the summer night no they do you very well indeed you pay for nothing but drinks so to speak but i'm afraid mine were of a comprehensive character i had started in a hole i ought really to have refused the invitation then we all went to the melbourne cup and i had the certain winner that didn't win and that's not the only way you can play the fool in melbourne i wasn't the steady old stager i am now bunny my analysis was a confession in itself but the others didn't know how hard up i was and i swore they shouldn't i tried the jews but they're extra fly out there then i thought of a kinsman of sorts a second cousin of my father's whom none of us knew anything about except that he was supposed to be in one or other of the colonies if he was a rich man well and good i would work him if not there would be no harm done i tried to get on his tracks and as luck would have it i succeeded or thought i had at the very moment when i happened to have a few days to myself i was cut over on the hand just before the big christmas match and couldn't have bowled a ball if they had played me the surgeon who fixed me up happened to ask me if i was any relation of raffles of the national bank and the pure luck of it almost took my breath away a relation who was a high official in one of the banks who would finance me on my mere name could anything be better i made up my mind that this raffles was the man i wanted and was awfully sold to find next moment that he wasn't a high official at all nor had the doctor so much as met him but had merely read of him in connection with a small sensation at the suburban branch which my namesake managed an armed robber had been rather pluckily beaten off with a bullet in him by this raffles and the sort of thing was so common out there that this was the first i had heard of it a suburban branch my financier had faded into some excellent fellow with a billet to lose if he called his soul his own still a manager was a manager and i said i would soon see whether this was the relative i was looking for if he would be good enough to give me the name of that branch the pie and the sits by the fire how should she be fair in walks the little dog says pussy are you there how do you do mistress pussy mistress pussy how do you do i thank you kindly little dog i fare as well as you old rhyme once upon a time there was a called ribby who invited a little dog called duchess to tea come in good time my dear duchess said ribby's letter and we will have something so very nice i am baking it in a a with a pink rim you never tasted anything so good and you shall eat it all i will eat muffins my dear duchess wrote ribby duchess read the letter and wrote an answer i will come with much pleasure at a quarter past four but it is very strange i was just going to invite you to come here to supper my dear ribby to eat something most delicious i will come very punctually my dear ribby wrote duchess and then at the end she added i hope it isn't mouse and then she thought that did not look quite polite so she scratched out isn't mouse and changed it to i hope it will be fine and she gave her letter to the postman but she thought a great deal about ribby's pie and she read ribby's letter over and over again i am dreadfully afraid it will be mouse said duchess to herself i really couldn't couldn't eat mouse pie and i shall have to eat it because it is a party and my pie was going to be veal and ham a pink and white and so is mine just like ribby's dishes they were both bought at tabitha twitchit's duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it it is all ready to put into the oven such lovely and i put in a little tin to hold up the crust and i made a hole in the middle with a fork to let out the steam oh i do wish i could eat my own pie instead of a pie made of mouse duchess considered and considered and read ribby s letter again a pink and white you shall eat it all you means me then ribby is not going to even taste the pie herself a pink and white ribby is sure to go out to buy the muffins oh what a good idea why shouldn't i rush along and put my pie into ribby's oven when ribby isn't there duchess was quite delighted with her own cleverness ribby in the meantime had received duchess's answer and as soon as she was sure that the little dog would come she popped her pie into the oven there were two ovens one above the other some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open ribby put the pie into the lower oven the door was very stiff the top oven bakes too quickly said ribby to herself it is a pie of the most delicate and tender mouse minced up with bacon and i have taken out all the bones because duchess did nearly choke herself with a last time i gave a party she eats a little fast rather big mouthfuls but a most genteel and elegant little dog infinitely superior company to cousin tabitha twitchit ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth then she went out with a can to the well for water to fill up the kettle then she began to set the room in order for it was the as well as the kitchen she shook the mats out at the and put them straight the was a she dusted the clock and the ornaments on the mantelpiece and she polished and rubbed the tables and chairs then she spread a very clean white and set out her best china which she took out of a near the fireplace the were white with a pattern of pink roses and the were white and blue when ribby had laid the table she took a jug and a blue and white dish and went out down the field to the farm to fetch milk and butter when she came back she peeped into the bottom oven the pie looked very comfortable ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket to the village shop to buy a packet of tea a pound of lump sugar and a pot of marmalade and just at the same time duchess came out of her house at the other end of the village ribby met duchess own the street also carrying a basket covered with a cloth they only bowed to one another they did not speak because they were going to have a party as soon as duchess had got round the corner out of sight she simply ran straight away to ribby's house ribby went into the shop and bought what she required and came out after a pleasant gossip with cousin tabitha twitchit cousin tabitha was disdainful afterwards in conversation chapter i the last word of two great coquettes after the disasters of the revolution of july which destroyed so many aristocratic fortunes dependent on the court madame la princesse de cadignan was clever enough to attribute to political events the total ruin she had caused by her own extravagance the prince left france with the royal family and never returned to it leaving the princess in paris protected by the fact of his absence for their debts which the sale of all their salable property had not been able to extinguish could only be recovered through him the revenues of the entailed estates had been seized in short the affairs of this great family were in as bad a state as those of the elder branch of the bourbons this woman so celebrated under her first name of duchesse de maufrigneuse very wisely decided to live in retirement and to make herself if possible forgotten paris was then so carried away by the whirling current of events that the duchesse de maufrigneuse buried in the princesse de cadignan a change of name unknown to most of the new actors brought upon the stage of society by the revolution of july did really become a stranger in her own city in paris the title of duke ranks all others even that of prince though in heraldic theory free of all sophism titles signify nothing there is absolute equality among gentlemen this fine equality was formerly maintained by the house of france itself and in our day it is so still at least nominally witness the care with which the kings of france give to their sons the simple title of count it was in virtue of this system that francois i crushed the splendid titles assumed by the pompous charles the fifth by signing his answer francois seigneur de vanves louis xi did better still by marrying his daughter to an untitled gentleman pierre de beaujeu the feudal system was so thoroughly broken up by louis xiv that the title of duke became during his reign the supreme honor of the aristocracy and the most coveted nevertheless there are two or three families in france in which the principality richly endowed in former times takes precedence of the duchy the house of cadignan which possesses the title of duc de maufrigneuse for its eldest sons is one of these exceptional families like the princes of the house of rohan in earlier days the princes of cadignan had the right to a throne in their own domain they could have pages and gentlemen in their service this explanation is necessary as much to escape foolish critics who know nothing as to record the customs of a world which we are told is about to disappear and which evidently so many persons are assisting to push away without knowing what it is the cadignans bear or five lozenges sable appointed placed with the word memini for motto a crown with a cap of maintenance no supporters or mantle in these days the great crowd of strangers flocking to paris and the almost universal ignorance of the science of heraldry are beginning to bring the title of prince into fashion there are no real princes but those possessed of principalities to whom belongs the title of highness the disdain shown by the french nobility for the title of prince and the reasons which caused louis xiv to give supremacy to the title of duke have prevented frenchmen from claiming the appellation of highness for the few princes who exist in france those of napoleon excepted this is why the princes of cadignan hold an inferior position nominally to the princes of the continent the members of the society called the faubourg protected the princess by a respectful silence due to her name which is one of those that all men honor to her misfortunes which they ceased to discuss and to her beauty the only thing she saved of her departed opulence society of which she had once been the ornament was thankful to her for having as it were taken the veil and cloistered herself in her own home this act of good taste was for her more than for any other woman an immense sacrifice great deeds are always so keenly felt in france that the princess gained by her retreat as much as she had lost in public opinion in the days of her splendor she now saw only one of her old friends the marquise and even to her she never went on festive occasions or to parties the princess and the marquise visited each other in the forenoons with a certain amount of secrecy when the princess went to dine with her friend the marquise closed her doors madame treated the princess charmingly she changed her box at the opera leaving the first tier for a baignoire on the so that madame de cadignan could come to the theatre unseen and depart incognito few women would have been capable of a delicacy which deprived them of the pleasure of bearing in their train a fallen rival and of publicly being her benefactress thus relieved of the necessity for costly toilets the princess could enjoy the theatre whither she went in madame carriage which she would never have accepted openly in the daytime no one has ever known madame reasons for behaving thus to the princesse de cadignan but her conduct was admirable and for a long time included a number of little acts which viewed single seem mere trifles but taken in the mass become gigantic xiv it is astonishing how short a time it takes for very wonderful things to happen it had taken only a few minutes apparently to change all the fortunes of the little boy dangling his red legs from the high stool in mr hobbs's store and to transform him from a small boy living the simplest life in a quiet street into an english nobleman the heir to an earldom and magnificent wealth it had taken only a few minutes apparently to change him from an english nobleman into a penniless little impostor with no right to any of the splendors he had been enjoying and surprising as it may appear it did not take nearly so long a time as one might have expected to alter the face of everything again and to give back to him all that he had been in danger of losing it took the less time because after all the woman who had called herself lady fauntleroy was not nearly so clever as she was wicked and when she had been closely pressed by mr havisham's questions about her marriage and her boy she had made one or two blunders which had caused suspicion to be awakened and then she had lost her presence of mind and her temper and in her excitement and anger had betrayed herself still further all the mistakes she made were about her child there seemed no doubt that she had been married to bevis lord fauntleroy and had quarreled with him and had been paid to keep away from him but mr havisham found out that her story of the boy's being born in a certain part of london was false and just when they all were in the midst of the commotion caused by this discovery there came the letter from the young lawyer in new york and mr hobbs's letters also what an evening it was when those letters arrived and when mr havisham and the earl sat and talked their plans over in the library after my first three meetings with her said mr havisham i began to suspect her strongly it appeared to me that the child was older than she said he was and she made a slip in speaking of the date of his birth and then tried to patch the matter up the story these letters bring fits in with several of my suspicions our best plan will be to cable at once for these two tiptons say nothing about them to her and suddenly confront her with them when she is not expecting it she is only a very clumsy plotter after all my opinion is that she will be frightened out of her wits and will betray herself on the spot and that was what actually happened she was told nothing and mr havisham kept her from suspecting anything by continuing to have interviews with her in which he assured her he was investigating her statements and she really began to feel so secure that her spirits rose immensely and she began to be as insolent as might have been expected but one fine morning as she sat in her at the inn called the dorincourt arms making some very fine plans for herself mr havisham was announced and when he entered he was followed by no less than three persons one was a boy and one was a big young man and the third was the earl of dorincourt she sprang to her feet and actually uttered a cry of terror it broke from her before she had time to check it she had thought of these as being thousands of miles away when she had ever thought of them at all which she had scarcely done for years she had never expected to see them again it must be confessed that dick grinned a little when he saw her hello minna he said the big young man who was ben stood still a minute and looked at her do you know her mr havisham asked glancing from one to the other yes said ben i know her and she knows me and he turned his back on her and went and stood looking out of the window as if the sight of her was hateful to him as indeed it was then the woman seeing herself so baffled and exposed lost all control over herself and flew into such a rage as ben and dick had often seen her in before dick grinned a trifle more as he watched her and heard the names she called them all and the violent threats she made but ben did not turn to look at her i can swear to her in any court he said to mr havisham and i can bring a dozen others who will her father is a respectable sort of man though he's low down in the world her mother was just like herself she's dead but he's alive and he's honest enough to be ashamed of her he'll tell you who she is and whether she married me or not then he clenched his hand suddenly and turned on her where's the child he demanded he's going with me he is done with you and so am i a will well we got the poor old doctor moved back to his room and had one of the chambermaids find him there and i wired to mrs van alstyne who was mr dicky carter's sister and who was on her honeymoon in south carolina the van alstynes came back at once in very bad tempers and we had the funeral from the preacher's house in finleyville so as not to harrow up the sanatorium people any more than necessary even as it was a few left but about twenty of the chronics stayed and it looked as if we might be able to keep going miss patty sent to town for a black veil for me and even went to the funeral it helped to take my mind off my troubles to think who it was that was holding my hand and comforting me and when toward the end of the service she got out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes i was almost overcome she being so to speak in the very shadow of a throne after it was all over the relatives gathered in the sun parlor of the sanatorium to hear the will mr van alstyne and his wife and about twenty more who had come up from the city for the funeral and stayed over on the house well the old doctor left me the buttons for his full dress waistcoat and his favorite copy of gray's anatomy i couldn't exactly set up housekeeping with my share of the estate but when the lawyer read that part of the will aloud and a grin went around the room i flounced out of my chair maybe you think i'm disappointed i said looking hard at the family who weren't making any particular pretense at grief and at the house people standing around the door maybe you think it's funny to see an unmarried woman get a set of waistcoat buttons and a medical book well that set of buttons was the set he bought in london on his wedding trip and the book's the one he read himself to sleep with every night for twenty years i'm proud to get them mr van alstyne touched me on the arm everybody knows how loyal you've been minnie he assured me now sit down like a good girl and listen to the rest of the will while i'm up i might as well get something else off my mind i said i know what's in that will but i hadn't anything to do with it mr van alstyne he took advantage of my being laid up with influenza last spring they thought that was funny but a few minutes later they weren't so cheerful you see the sanatorium was a mighty fine piece of property with a deer park and golf links we'd had plenty of offers to sell it for a summer hotel but we'd both been dead against it that was one of the reasons for the will the whole estate was left to dicky carter who hadn't been able to come owing to his being laid up with an attack of mumps the family sat up and nodded at one another or held up its hands but when they heard there was a condition they breathed easier beginning with one week after the reading of the will and not a day later mr dick was to take charge of the sanatorium and to stay there for two months without a day off if at the end of that time the place was being successfully conducted and could show that it hadn't lost money the entire property became his for keeps if he failed it was to be sold and the money given to charity you would have to know richard carter to understand the excitement the will caused most of us i reckon like the sort of person we've never dared to be ourselves the old doctor had gone to bed at ten o'clock all his life and got up at seven and so he had a sneaking fondness for the one particular grandson who often didn't go to bed at all twice to my knowledge when he was in his teens did dicky carter run away from school and twice his grandfather kept him for a week hidden in the on the golf links naturally when mr van alstyne and i had to hide him again which is further on in the story he went to the old like a dog to its kennel only this time but that's ahead too well the family went back to town in a buzz of indignation and i carried my waistcoat buttons and my anatomy out to the and had a good cry there was a man named thoburn who was crazy for the property as a summer hotel and every time i shut my eyes i could see thoburn house over the veranda and children sailing paper boats in the mineral spring sure enough the next afternoon mr thoburn drove out from finleyville with a suit case and before he'd taken off his overcoat he came out to the hello minnie he exclaimed does the old man's ghost come back to dope the spring or do you do it chapter xvi in which i turn smuggler and the captain casuist the last night at midway i had little sleep the next morning after the sun was risen and the clatter of departure had begun to reign on deck i lay a long while dozing and when at last i stepped from the companion the schooner was already leaping through the pass into the open sea close on her board the huge scroll of a breaker unfurled itself along the reef with a prodigious clamour and behind i saw the wreck vomiting into the morning air a coil of smoke the wreaths already blew out far to leeward flames already glittered in the cabin skylight and the were scattered in surprise as wide as the lagoon as we drew farther off the conflagration of the flying scud flamed higher and long after we had dropped all signs of midway island the smoke still hung in the horizon like that of a distant steamer with the fading out of that last vestige the norah creina passed again into the empty world of cloud and water by which she had approached and the next features that appeared eleven days later to break the line of sky were the arid mountains of oahu it has often since been a comfortable thought to me that we had thus destroyed the remnants of the flying scud and often a strange one that my last sight and reminiscence of that fatal ship should be a pillar of smoke on the horizon to so many others besides myself the same appearance had played a part in the various stages of that business luring some to what they little imagined filling some with unimaginable terrors but ours was the last smoke raised in the story and with its dying away the secret of the flying scud became a private property it was by the first light of dawn that we saw close on board the metropolitan island of hawaii we held along the coast as near as we could venture with a fresh breeze and under an unclouded heaven beholding as we went the arid mountain sides and scrubby of that somewhat melancholy archipelago about four of the afternoon we turned waimanolo point the westerly headland of the great bight of honolulu showed ourselves for twenty minutes in full view and then fell again to leeward and put in the rest of daylight plying under shortened sail under the lee of waimanolo a little after dark we beat once more about the point and crept cautiously toward the mouth of the pearl lochs where jim and i had arranged i was to meet the smugglers the night was happily obscure the water smooth we showed according to instructions no light on deck only a red lantern dropped from either cathead to within a couple of feet of the water a lookout was stationed on the bowsprit end another in the crosstrees and the whole ship's company crowded forward scouting for enemies or friends it was now the crucial moment of our enterprise we were now risking liberty and credit and that for a sum so small to a man in my bankrupt situation that i could have laughed aloud in bitterness but the piece had been arranged and we must play it to the finish for some while we saw nothing but the dark mountain outline of the island the torches of native fishermen glittering here and there along the foreshore and right in the midst that cluster of brave lights with which the town of honolulu advertises itself to the seaward presently a ruddy star appeared inshore of us and seemed to draw near unsteadily this was the anticipated signal and we made haste to show the countersign lowering a white light from the quarter extinguishing the two others and laying the schooner incontinently to the star approached slowly the sounds of oars and of men's speech came to us across the water and then a voice hailed us is that mr dodd yes i returned is jim pinkerton there no sir replied the voice but there's one of his crowd here name of speedy i'm here mr dodd added speedy himself i have letters for you all right i replied come aboard gentlemen and let me see my mail a whaleboat accordingly ranged alongside and three men boarded us my old san francisco friend the speedy a little wizened person of the name of sharpe and a big flourishing man called fowler the two last i learned afterward were frequent partners sharpe supplied the capital and fowler who was quite a character in the islands and occupied a considerable station brought activity daring and a private influence highly necessary in the case both seemed to approach the business with a keen sense of romance and i believe this was the chief attraction at least with fowler for whom i early conceived a sentiment of liking but in that first moment i had something else to think of than to judge my new acquaintances and before speedy had fished out the letters the full extent of our misfortune was revealed we've rather bad news for you mr dodd said fowler your firm's gone up a writer's request of his master let me never tag a moral to a story nor tell a story without a meaning make me respect my material so much that i dare not slight my work help me to deal very honestly with words and with people because they are both alive show me that as in a river so in a writing clearness is the best quality and a little that is pure is worth more than much that is mixed teach me to see the local colour without being blind to the inner light give me an ideal that will stand the strain of weaving into human stuff on the loom of the real keep me from caring more for books than for folks for art than for life steady me to do my full stint of work as well as i can and when that is done stop me pay what wages thou wilt and help me to say from a quiet heart a grateful amen preface in every life worth writing about there is a ruling passion the very pulse of the machine unless you touch that you are groping around outside of reality sometimes it is romantic love natures masterpiece of interested benevolence in almost all lives this passion has its season of empire therefore and rightly it is the favourite theme of the storyteller romantic love interests almost everybody because almost everybody knows something about it or would like to know but there are other passions no less real which also have their place and power in human life some of them come earlier and sometimes they last longer than romantic love they play alongside of it and are mixed up with it now checking it now advancing its flow and tingeing it with their own colour just because love is so universal it is often to one of the other passions that we must look for the distinctive hue the individual quality of a granted if you will that everybody must fall in love or ought to fall in love how will he do it and what will he do afterwards these are questions not without interest to one who watches the human drama as a friend the answers depend upon those hidden and durable desires affections and impulses to which men and women give themselves up for rule and guidance music nature children honour strife revenge money pride friendship loyalty duty to these objects and others like them the secret power of personal passion often turns and the life unconsciously follows it as the tides in the sea follow the moon in the sky when circumstances cross the ruling passion when rocks lie in the way and winds are contrary then things happen characters emerge slight events are significant mere adventures are transformed into a real plot what care i how many scapes and moving accidents your hero may pass through unless i know him for a man he is but a puppet strung on wires his kisses are wooden and his wounds bleed sawdust there is nothing about him to remember except his name and perhaps a bit of dialect kill him or crown him what difference does it make but go the other way about your work take the least man of all mankind as i look at his head and heart find how and why he differs from his fellows utterly and now there is something to tell with a meaning if you tell it at length it is a novel a painting if you tell it in brief it is a short story an etching but the subject is always the same the unseen mysterious ruling passion weaving the stuff of human nature into patterns wherein the soul is imaged and revealed to tell about some of these ruling passions simply clearly and concretely is what i want to do in this book the characters are chosen for the most part among plain people because their feelings are expressed with fewer words and greater truth not being costumed for social effect the scene is laid on nature's stage because i like to be even when i am trying to think and learning to write avalon princeton july contents i a lover of music ii the reward of virtue iii a brave heart iv the gentle life v a friend of justice vi the white blot vii a year of nobility viii the keeper of the light i a lover of music i he entered the backwoods village of bytown literally on the wings of the wind it whirled him along like a big snowflake and dropped him at the door of moody's sportsmen's retreat as if he were a new year's gift from the north pole his coming seemed a mere chance but perhaps there was something more in it after all at all events you shall hear if you will the time and the manner of his arrival it was the last night of december some years ago all the city sportsmen who had hunted the deer under bill moody's direction had long since retreated to their homes leaving the little settlement on the border of the adirondack wilderness wholly under the social direction of the natives the annual ball was in full swing in the of the hotel at one side of the room the tables and chairs were piled up with their legs projecting in the air like a thicket of very dead trees chapter xiii oolanga's hallucinations during the last few days lady arabella had been getting exceedingly impatient her debts always pressing were growing to an embarrassing amount the only hope she had of comfort in life was a good marriage but the good marriage on which she had fixed her eye did not seem to move quickly enough indeed it did not seem to move at all in the right direction edgar caswall was not an ardent wooer from the very first he seemed difficile but he had been keeping to his own room ever since his struggle with mimi watford on that occasion lady arabella had shown him in an unmistakable way what her feelings were indeed she had made it known to him in a more overt way than pride should allow that she wished to help and support him the moment when she had gone across the room to stand beside him in his mesmeric struggle had been the very limit of her voluntary action it was quite bitter enough she felt that he did not come to her but now that she had made that advance she felt that any withdrawal on his part would to a woman of her class be nothing less than a flaming insult had she not classed herself with his nigger servant an unreformed savage had she not shown her preference for him at the festival of his had she not lady arabella was and she was prepared to go through all that might be necessary of indifference and even insult to become chatelaine of castra regis in the meantime she would show no hurry she must wait she might in an unostentatious way come to him again she knew him now and could make a keen guess at his desires with regard to lilla watford with that secret in her possession she could bring pressure to bear on caswall which would make it no easy matter for him to evade her the great difficulty was how to get near him he was shut up within his castle and guarded by a defence of convention which she could not pass without danger of ill repute to herself over this question she thought and thought for days and nights at last she decided that the only way would be to go to him openly at castra regis her rank and position would make such a thing possible if carefully done she could explain matters afterwards if necessary then when they were alone she would use her arts and her experience to make him commit himself after all he was only a man with a man's dislike of difficult or awkward situations she felt quite sufficient confidence in her own womanhood to carry her through any difficulty which might arise from diana's grove she heard each day the from castra regis sound and knew the hour when the servants would be in the back of the house she would enter the house at that hour and pretending that she could not make anyone hear her would seek him in his own rooms the tower was she knew away from all the usual sounds of the house and moreover she knew that the servants had strict orders not to interrupt him when he was in the turret chamber she had found out partly by the aid of an and partly by judicious questioning that several times lately a heavy chest had been carried to and from his room and that it rested in the room each night she was therefore confident that he had some important work on hand which would keep him busy for long spells meanwhile another member of the household at castra regis had schemes which he thought were working to fruition a man in the position of a servant has plenty of opportunity of watching his betters and forming opinions regarding them oolanga was in his way a clever unscrupulous rogue and he felt that with things moving round him in this great household there should be opportunities of being unscrupulous and stealthy and a savage he looked to dishonest means he saw plainly enough that lady arabella was making a dead set at his master and he was watchful of the slightest sign of anything which might enhance this knowledge like the other men in the house he knew of the carrying to and fro of the great chest and had got it into his head that the care exercised in its porterage indicated that it was full of treasure he was for ever lurking around the on the chance of making some useful discovery but he was as cautious as he was stealthy and took care that no one else watched him it was thus that the negro became aware of lady arabella's venture into the house as she thought unseen he took more care than ever since he was watching another that the positions were not reversed more than ever he kept his eyes and ears open and his mouth shut seeing lady arabella gliding up the stairs towards his master's room he took it for granted that she was there for no good and doubled his watching intentness and caution sir i am now availing myself of the liberty you have frequently honoured me with of dedicating one of my novels to you that it is unfinished i greive yet fear that from me it will always remain so that as far as it is carried it should be so trifling and so unworthy of you is another concern to your obliged humble servant the author messrs demand and co please to pay jane austen spinster the sum of one hundred guineas on account of your humble servant h t austen lesley castle letter the first is from miss margaret lesley to miss charlotte lutterell lesley castle janry my brother has just left us matilda said he at parting you and margaret will i am certain take all the care of my dear little one that she might have received from an indulgent and affectionate and amiable mother tears rolled down his cheeks as he spoke these words the remembrance of her who had so wantonly disgraced the maternal character and so openly violated the conjugal duties prevented his adding anything farther he embraced his sweet child and after saluting matilda and me hastily broke from us and seating himself in his chaise pursued the road to aberdeen never was there a better young man ah how little did he deserve the misfortunes he has experienced in the marriage state so good a husband to so bad a wife for you know my dear charlotte that the worthless louisa left him her child and reputation a few weeks ago in company with danvers and dishonour never was there a sweeter face a finer form or a less amiable heart than louisa owned her child already possesses the personal charms of her unhappy mother may she inherit from her father all his mental ones lesley is at present but five and twenty and has already given himself up to melancholy and despair what a difference between him and his father sir george is and still remains the beau the flighty stripling the gay lad and sprightly youngster that his son was really about five years back and that he has affected to appear ever since my remembrance while our father is fluttering about the streets of london gay dissipated and thoughtless at the age of matilda and i continue secluded from mankind in our old and mouldering castle which is situated two miles from perth on a bold projecting rock and commands an extensive veiw of the town and its delightful environs but tho retired from almost all the world for we visit no one but the m'leods the m'kenzies the m'phersons the m'cartneys the m'donalds the m'kinnons the m'lellans the m'kays the macbeths and the macduffs we are neither dull nor unhappy on the contrary there never were two more lively more agreable or more witty girls than we are not an hour in the day hangs heavy on our hands we read we work we walk and when fatigued with these employments releive our spirits either by a lively song a graceful dance or by some smart and witty repartee we are handsome my dear charlotte very handsome and the greatest of our perfections is that we are entirely insensible of them ourselves but why do i thus dwell on myself let me rather repeat the praise of our dear little neice the innocent louisa who is at present sweetly smiling in a gentle nap as she reposes on the sofa the dear creature is just turned of two years old as handsome as tho and as sensible as tho and and as prudent as tho and to convince you of this i must inform you that she has a very fine complexion and very pretty features that she already knows the two first letters in the alphabet and that she never tears her frocks if i have not now convinced you of her beauty sense and prudence i have nothing more to urge in support of my assertion and you will therefore have no way of deciding the affair but by coming to and by a personal acquaintance with louisa determine for yourself ah my dear freind how happy should i be to see you within these venerable walls it is now four years since my removal from school has separated me from you that two such tender hearts so closely linked together by the ties of simpathy and freindship should be so widely removed from each other is vastly moving i live in perthshire you in sussex we might meet in london were my father disposed to carry me there and were your mother to be there at the same time we might meet at bath at tunbridge or anywhere else indeed could we but be at the same place together we have only to hope that such a period may arrive my father does not return to us till autumn my brother will leave scotland in a few days he is impatient to travel mistaken youth he vainly flatters himself that change of air will heal the wounds of a broken heart you will join with me i am certain my dear charlotte in prayers for the recovery of the unhappy lesley's peace of mind which must ever be essential to that of your sincere freind m lesley chapter iii a few weeks later coming early one morning into singapore from a journey to the southward i saw the brig lying at anchor in all her usual symmetry and splendour of aspect as though she had been taken out of a glass case and put delicately into the water that very moment she was well out in the roadstead but i steamed in and took up my habitual berth close in front of the town before we had finished breakfast a came to tell me that captain boat was coming our way his smart gig dashed alongside and in two bounds he was up our and shaking me by the hand with his nervous grip his eyes snapping inquisitively for he supposed i had called at the seven isles group on my way i reached into my pocket for a nicely folded little note which he grabbed out of my hand without ceremony and carried off on the bridge to read by himself after a decent interval i followed him up there and found him pacing to and fro for the nature of his emotions made him restless even in his most thoughtful moments he shook his head at me triumphantly well my dear boy he said i shall be counting the days now i understood what he meant i knew that those young people had settled already on a runaway match without official preliminaries this was really a logical decision old nelson or nielsen would never have agreed to give up freya peaceably to this compromising jasper heavens what would the dutch authorities say to such a match it sounds too ridiculous for words but nothing in the world more selfishly hard than a timorous man in a fright about his little estate as old nelson used to call it in apologetic accents a heart permeated by a particular sort of funk is proof against sense feeling and ridicule a flint jasper would have made his request all the same and then taken his own way but it was freya who decided that nothing should be said on the ground that papa would only worry himself to distraction he was capable of making himself ill and then she have the heart to leave him here you have the sanity of feminine outlook and the frankness of feminine reasoning and for the rest miss freya could read poor dear papa in the way a woman reads a man like an open book his daughter once gone old nelson would not worry himself he would raise a great outcry and make no end of lamentable fuss but not the same thing the real agonies of indecision the anguish of conflicting feelings would be spared to him and as he was too unassuming to rage he would after a period of lamentation devote himself to his little estate and to keeping on good terms with the authorities time would do the rest and freya thought she could afford to wait while ruling over her own home in the beautiful brig and over the man who loved her this was the life for her who had learned to walk on a deck she was a a if ever there was one and of course she loved jasper and trusted him but there was a shade of anxiety in her pride it is very fine and romantic to possess for your very own a finely tempered and trusty but whether it is the best weapon to counter with the common of fate another question she knew that she had the more substance of the two you try any cheap jokes i am not talking of their weights she was just a little anxious while he was away and she had me who being a tried confidant took the liberty to whisper frequently the sooner the better but there was a peculiar vein of obstinacy in miss freya and her reason for delay was characteristic not before my birthday so that there shall be no mistake in minds as to me being old enough to know what i am doing feelings were in such subjection that he had never even remonstrated against the decree she was just splendid whatever she did or said and there was an end of it for him i believe that he was subtle enough to be even flattered at bottom at times and then to console him he had the brig which seemed pervaded by the spirit of freya since whatever he did on board was always done under the supreme sanction of his love yes soon begin to count the days he repeated eleven months more have to crowd three trips into that mind you come to grief trying to do too much i admonished him but he dismissed my caution with a laugh and an elated gesture pooh nothing nothing could happen to the brig he cried as if the flame of his heart could light up the dark nights of uncharted seas and the image of freya serve for an unerring beacon amongst hidden shoals as if the winds had to wait on his future the stars fight for it in their courses as if the magic of his passion had the power to float a ship on a drop of dew or sail her through the eye of a needle simply because it was her magnificent lot to be the servant of a love so full of grace as to make all the ways of the earth safe resplendent and easy chapter i it was four in the morning when george dupont closed the door and came down the steps to the street the first faint streaks of dawn were in the sky and he noticed this with annoyance because he knew that his hair was in disarray and his whole aspect disorderly yet he dared not take a cab because he feared to attract attention at home when he reached the sidewalk he glanced about him to make sure that no one had seen him leave the house then started down the street his eyes upon the sidewalk before him george had the feeling of the morning after there are few men in this world of abundant sin who will not know what the phrase means the fumes of the night had evaporated he was quite sober now quite free from excitement he saw what he had done and it seemed to him something black and disgusting never had a walk seemed longer than the few blocks which he had to traverse to reach his home he must get there before the maid was up before the boy called with the rolls otherwise what explanation could he give he who had always been such a moral man who had been pointed out by mothers as an example to their sons george thought of his own mother and what she would think if she could know about his adventure he thought again and again with a pang of anguish of henriette could it be possible that a man who was engaged whose marriage contract had actually been signed who was soon to possess the love of a beautiful and noble girl that such a man could have been weak enough and base enough to let himself be trapped into such a low action he went back over the whole series of events shuddering at them trying to realize how they had happened trying to excuse himself for them he had not intended such a culmination he had never meant to do such a thing in his life he had not thought of any harm when he had accepted the invitation to the supper party with his old companions from the law school of course he had known that several of these chums led fast lives but then surely a fellow could go to a rooms for a lark without harm he remembered the girl who had sat by his side at the table she had come with a friend who was a married woman and so he had assumed that she was all right george remembered how embarrassed he had been when first he had noticed her glances at him but then the wine had begun to go to his head he was one of those unfortunate wretches who cannot drink wine at all he had offered to take the girl home in a cab and on the way he had lost his head oh what a wretched thing it was he could hardly believe that it was he who had spoken those frenzied words and yet he must have spoken them because he remembered them he remembered that it had taken a long time to persuade her he had had to promise her a ring like the one her married friend wore before they entered her home she had made him take off his shoes so that the porter might not hear them this had struck george particularly because even flushed with excitement as he was he had not forgotten the warnings his father had given him as to the dangers of contact with strange women he had thought to himself this girl must be safe it is probably the first time she has ever done such a thing but now george could get but little consolation out of that idea he was suffering intensely the emotion described by the poet in the bitter words about moving finger having writ his mind seeking some explanation some justification went back to the events before that night with a sudden pang of yearning he thought of lizette she was a decent girl and had kept him decent and he was lonely without her he had been so afraid of being found out that he had given her up when he became engaged but now for a while he felt that he would have to break his resolution and pay his regular sunday visit to the little flat in the portion of paris it was while george was fitting himself for the same career as his father that of notary that he had made the acquaintance of the young working girl it may not be easy to believe but lizette had really been a decent girl she had a family to take care of and was in need there was a grandmother in poor health a father not much better and three little brothers so lizette did not very long resist george dupont and he felt quite virtuous in giving her sufficient money to take care of these unfortunate people among people of his class it was considered proper to take such things if one paid for them all the family of this working girl were grateful to him they adored him and they called him uncle raoul for of course he had not been so foolish as to give them his true name iii michael ivanovich awoke early next morning he entered his study and handed him the cheque filled in for a sum which he asked him to pay in monthly instalments to his daughter he inquired when the express left for st petersburg the train left at seven in the evening giving him time for an early dinner before leaving he breakfasted with his who refrained from mentioning the subject which was so painful to him but only looked at him timidly and after breakfast he went out for his regular morning walk alexandra dmitrievna followed him into the hall go into the public gardens michael it is very charming there and quite near to everything said she meeting his sombre looks with a pathetic glance michael ivanovich followed her advice and went to the public gardens which were so near to everything and meditated with annoyance on the stupidity the obstinacy and heartlessness of women she is not in the very least sorry for me he thought of his she cannot even understand my sorrow and what of her he was thinking of his daughter she knows what all this means to me the torture what a blow in old age my days will be shortened by it but rather have it over than endure this agony and all that pour les beaux yeux chenapan oh he moaned and a wave of hatred and fury arose in him as he thought of what would be said in the town when every one knew and no doubt every one knew already such a feeling of rage possessed him that he would have liked to beat it into her head and make her understand what she had done these women never understand it is quite near everything suddenly came to his mind and getting out his notebook he found her address vera ivanovna silvestrova kukonskaya street house she was living under this name he left the gardens and called a cab whom do you wish to see sir asked the midwife maria ivanovna when he stepped on the narrow landing of the steep stuffy staircase does madame silvestrova live here vera ivanovna yes please come in she has gone out gone to the shop round the corner but be back in a minute michael ivanovich followed the stout figure of maria ivanovna into a tiny parlour and from the next room came the screams of a baby sounding cross and peevish which filled him with disgust they cut him like a knife maria ivanovna apologised and went into the room and he could hear her soothing the child the child became quiet and she returned that is her baby be back in a minute you are a friend of hers i suppose yes a friend but i think i had better come back later on said michael ivanovich preparing to go it was too unbearable this preparation to meet her and any explanation seemed impossible he had just turned to leave when he heard quick light steps on the stairs and he recognised voice maria ivanovna has he been crying while been gone i was then she saw her father the parcel she was carrying fell from her hands father she cried and stopped in the doorway white and trembling he remained motionless staring at her she had grown so thin her eyes were larger her nose sharper her hands worn and bony he neither knew what to do nor what to say he forgot all his grief about his dishonour he only felt sorrow infinite sorrow for her sorrow for her thinness and for her miserable rough clothing and most of all for her pitiful face and imploring eyes father forgive she said moving towards him forgive forgive me he murmured and he began to sob like a child kissing her face and hands and wetting them with his tears in his pity for her he understood himself and when he saw himself as he was he realised how he had wronged her how guilty he had been in his pride in his coldness even in his anger towards her he was glad that it was he who was guilty and that he had nothing to forgive but that he himself needed forgiveness she took him to her tiny room and told him how she lived but she did not show him the child nor did she mention the past knowing how painful it would be to him he told her that she must live differently yes if i could only live in the country said she we will talk it over he said suddenly the child began to wail and to scream she opened her eyes very wide and not taking them from her face remained hesitating and motionless well i suppose you must feed him said michael ivanovich and frowned with the obvious effort she got up and suddenly the wild idea seized her to show him whom she loved so deeply the thing she now loved best of all in the world but first she looked at her face would he be angry or not his face revealed no anger only suffering yes go go said he god bless you yes come again and we will decide my darling again he found it hard to swallow the lump in his throat chapter xvii the evening of the second day had already come when arrived home after weekending amongst a tribe of rebellious subjects but any imposing state entry which might have been intended was rendered impossible by the heat and the threat of that baleful world in the western sky it was a lurid but disordered spectacle which i witnessed from my room in the just after nightfall the returning army had apparently fallen away exhausted on its march through the town only some three hundred of the bodyguard straggled up the hill limp and sweating behind a group of pennons in the midst of which rode a horseman whose commanding presence and splendid war harness impressed me though i could not make out his features a wild impressionist scene of black outlines tossing headgear and spears glittering and vanishing in front of the red glare in the sky but nothing more even the dry throats of the suitors in the courtyard hardly mustered a husky cry of welcome as the cavalcade trooped into the enclosure and then the shadows enfolded them up in silence and too hot and listless to care much what the morrow brought forth i threw myself on the bare floor tossing and turning in a vain endeavour to sleep until dawn came once more a thin mist which fell with daybreak drew a veil over the horrible glare in the west for an hour or two and taking advantage of the slight alleviation of heat i rose and went into the gardens to enjoy a dip in a pool making with its surrounding jungle of flowers one of the pleasantest things about the forest citadel the very earth seemed scorched and baking underfoot and the pool was gone it had run as dry as a limekiln nothing remained of the pretty fall which had fed it but a miserable trickle of drops from the cascade above down beyond the town shone a gleam of water where the bitter canal steamed and simmered in the first grey of the morning but up here six months of scorching drought could not have worked more havoc the very leaves were dropping from the trees and the luxuriant growths of the day before looked as though a simoon had played upon them i staggered back in disgust and found some show of official activity about the palace it was the king's custom it appeared to hear petitions and redress wrongs as soon after his return as possible but today the ceremony was to be cut short as his majesty was going out with all his court to a neighbouring mountain to pray away the comet which by this time was causing dire alarm all through the city heaven's own particular blessing on his prayers my friend i said to the man who told me this unless his majesty's orisons are fruitful we shall all be cooked like baked potatoes before nightfall and though i have faced many kinds of death that is not the one i would choose by preference is there a chance of myself being heard at the throne your peculiar climate tempts me to hurry up with my business and begone if i may not only may you be heard sir but you are summoned the king has heard of you somehow and sent me to find and bring you into his presence at once so be it i said too hot to care what happened i have no levee dress with me i lost my luggage check some time ago but if you will wait outside i will be with you in a moment hastily tidying myself up and giving my hair a comb as though just off to see mr secretary for the navy or on the way to get a senator to push a new patent medicine for me i rejoined my guide outside and together we crossed the wide courtyard entered the great portals of house and immediately afterwards found ourselves in a vast hall dimly lit by rays coming in through square spaces under the eaves and crowded on both sides with guards courtiers and supplicants the heat was tremendous the odour of thither men and the hides they wore almost overpowering yet little i recked for either for there at the top of the room seated on a dais made of wood inlet with gold and covered with splendid furs was himself a fine fellow swarthy huge and hairy at any other time or place i could have given him due admiration as an admirable example of the savage on the borderland of grace and culture but now i only glanced at him and then to where at his side a girl was crouching a gem of human loveliness against that dusky setting it was heru my ravished princess and still clad in her diaphanous hither robes her face white with anxiety her eyes bright as stars the embodiment of helpless flowery beauty my heart turned over at sight of her poor girl when she saw me stride into the hall she rose swiftly from side clasped her pretty hands and giving a cry of joy would have rushed towards me but the king laid a mighty paw upon her under which she subsided with a shiver as though the touch had blanched all the life within nikobob refuses a crown almost the first persons that zella saw when she landed from the boat at regos were her father and mother nikobob and his wife had been greatly worried when their little daughter failed to return from coregos so they had set out to discover what had become of her when they reached the city of regos that very morning they were astonished to hear news of all the strange events that had taken place still they found comfort when told that zella had been seen in the boat of prince inga which had gone to the north then while they wondered what this could mean the boat appeared again with their daughter in it and they ran down to the shore to give her a welcome and many joyful kisses inga invited the good people to the palace of king gos where he conferred with them as well as with rinkitink and bilbil now that the king and queen of regos and coregos have run away he said there is no one to rule these islands so it is my duty to appoint a new ruler and as nikobob zella's father is an honest and worthy man i shall make him the king of the twin islands me cried nikobob astounded by this speech i beg your highness on my bended knees not to do so cruel a thing as to make me king why not inquired rinkitink i'm a king and i know how it feels i assure you good nikobob that i quite enjoy my high rank although a jeweled crown is rather heavy to wear in hot weather with you noble sir it is different said nikobob for you are far from your kingdom and its trials and worries and may do as you please but to remain in regos as king over these fierce and unruly warriors would be to live in constant anxiety and peril and the chances are that they would murder me within a month as i have done no harm to anyone and have tried to be a good and upright man i do not think that i should be condemned to such a dreadful fate very well replied inga we will say no more about your being king i merely wanted to make you rich and prosperous as i had promised zella please forget that promise pleaded the earnestly i have been safe from molestation for many years because i was poor and possessed nothing that anyone else could envy but if you make me rich and prosperous i shall at once become the prey of thieves and marauders and probably will lose my life in the attempt to protect my fortune inga looked at the man in surprise what then can i do to please you he inquired nothing more than to allow me to go home to my poor cabin said nikobob perhaps remarked king rinkitink the has more wisdom concealed in that hard head of his than we gave him credit for but let us use that wisdom for the present to counsel us what to do in this emergency what you call my wisdom said nikobob is merely common sense i have noticed that some men become rich and are scorned by some and robbed by others other men become famous and are mocked at and derided by their fellows but the poor and humble man who lives unnoticed and unknown escapes all these troubles and is the only one who can appreciate the joy of living if i had a hand instead of a cloven hoof i'd like to shake hands with you nikobob said bilbil the goat but the poor man must not have a cruel master or he is undone during the council they found indeed that the advice of the was both shrewd and sensible and they profited much by his words inga gave captain buzzub the command of the warriors and made him promise to keep his men quiet and orderly if he could then the boy allowed all of king gos's former slaves except those who came from pingaree to choose what boats they required and to stock them with provisions and row away to their own countries when these had departed with grateful thanks and many blessings showered upon the boy prince who had set them free inga made preparations to send his own people home where they were told to rebuild their houses and then erect a new royal palace they were then to await patiently the coming of king kitticut or prince inga my greatest worry said the boy to his friends is to know whom to appoint to take charge of this work of restoring pingaree to its former condition my men are all pearl fishers and although willing and honest have no talent for directing others how to work while the preparations for departure were being made nikobob offered to direct the men of pingaree and did so in a very capable manner as the island had been despoiled of all its valuable furniture and draperies and rich cloths and paintings and statuary and the like as well as gold and silver and ornaments inga thought it no more than just that they be replaced by the spoilers so he directed his people to search through the storehouses of king gos and to regain all their goods and chattels that could be found also he instructed them to take as much else as they required to make their new homes comfortable so that many boats were loaded full of goods that would enable the people to restore pingaree to its former state of comfort the lovely lady of light the palace of the queen of light stood on a little eminence and was a mass of crystal windows surmounted by a vast crystal dome when they entered the portals erma was greeted by six lovely maidens evidently of high degree who at once aroused betsy's admiration each bore a wand in her hand tipped with an emblem of light and their costumes were also emblematic of the lights they represented erma introduced them to her guests and each made a graceful and courteous acknowledgment first was sunlight radiantly beautiful and very fair the second was moonlight a soft dreamy damsel with hair next came starlight equally lovely but inclined to be retiring and shy these three were dressed in shimmering robes of silvery white the fourth was daylight a brilliant damsel with laughing eyes and frank manners who wore a variety of colors then came firelight clothed in a fleecy robe that wavered around her shapely form in a very attractive manner the sixth maiden electra was the most beautiful of all and betsy thought from the first that both sunlight and daylight regarded electra with envy and were a little jealous of her but all were cordial in their greetings to the strangers and seemed to regard the queen of light with much affection for they fluttered around her in a flashing radiant group as she led the way to her regal this apartment was richly and cosily furnished the upholstery being of many tints and both betsy and polychrome enjoyed resting themselves upon the downy divans after their strenuous adventures of the day the queen sat down to chat with her guests who noticed that daylight was the only maiden now seated beside erma the others had retired to another part of the room where they sat modestly with entwined arms and did not intrude themselves at all the queen told the strangers all about this beautiful land which is one of the chief residences of fairies who minister to the needs of mankind so many important fairies lived there that to avoid rivalry they had elected as their ruler the only important personage in the country who had no duties to mankind to perform and was in effect a private citizen this ruler or jinjin as was his title bore the name of and the most singular thing about him was that he had no heart but instead of this he possessed a high degree of reason and justice and while he showed no mercy in his judgments he never punished unjustly or without reason to was as terrible as he was heartless but those who were innocent of evil had nothing to fear from him all the kings and queens of this fairyland paid reverence to jinjin for as they expected to be obeyed by others they were willing to obey the one in authority over them the inhabitants of the land of oz had heard many tales of this fearfully just jinjin whose punishments were always equal to the faults committed polychrome also knew of him although this was the first time she had ever seen him face to face but to betsy the story was all new and she was greatly interested in whom she no longer feared time sped swiftly during their talk and suddenly betsy noticed that moonlight was sitting beside the queen of light instead of daylight but tell me please she pleaded why do you all wear a dragon's head embroidered on your gowns erma's pleasant face became grave as she answered the dragon as you must know was the first living creature ever made therefore the dragon is the oldest and wisest of living things by good fortune the original dragon who still lives is a resident of this land and supplies us with wisdom whenever we are in need of it he is old as the world and remembers everything that has happened since the world was created did he ever have any children inquired the girl yes many of them some wandered into other lands where men not understanding them made war upon them but many still reside in this country none however is as wise as the original dragon for whom we have great respect as he was the first resident here we wear the emblem of the dragon's head to show that we are the favored people who alone have the right to inhabit this fairyland which in beauty almost equals the fairyland of oz and in power quite surpasses it i understand about the dragon now said polychrome nodding her lovely head betsy did not quite understand but she was at present interested in observing the changing lights as daylight had given way to moonlight so now starlight sat at the right hand of erma the queen and with her coming a spirit of peace and content seemed to fill the room polychrome being herself a fairy had many questions to ask about the various kings and queens who lived in this secluded place and before erma had finished answering them a rosy glow filled the room and firelight took her place beside the queen betsy liked firelight but to gaze upon her warm and glowing features made the little girl sleepy and presently she began to nod thereupon erma rose and took betsy's hand gently in her own chapter xiii long before daylight the camp at nephi was astir the cattle were driven out to water and pasture while the men unchained the wheels and drew the wagons apart and clear for yoking in the women cooked forty breakfasts over forty fires the children in the chill of dawn clustered about the fires sharing places here and there with the last relief of the waiting sleepily for coffee it requires time to get a large train such as ours under way for its speed is the speed of the slowest so the sun was an hour high and the day was already uncomfortably hot when we rolled out of nephi and on into the sandy barrens no inhabitant of the place saw us off all chose to remain indoors thus making our departure as ominous as they had made our arrival the night before again it was long hours of parching heat and biting dust and sand and a land accursed no dwellings of men neither cattle nor fences nor any sign of human kind did we encounter all that day and at night we made our beside an empty stream in the damp sand of which we dug many holes that filled slowly with water seepage our subsequent journey is always a broken experience to me we made camp so many times always with the wagons drawn in circle that to my child mind a weary long time passed after nephi but always strong upon all of us was that sense of drifting to an impending and certain doom we averaged about fifteen miles a day i know for my father had said it was sixty miles to fillmore the next mormon settlement and we made three camps on the way this meant four days of travel from nephi to the last camp of which i have any memory we must have taken two weeks or a little less at fillmore the inhabitants were hostile as all had been since salt lake they laughed at us when we tried to buy food and were not above taunting us with being missourians when we entered the place hitched before the largest house of the dozen houses that composed the settlement were two dusty streaked with sweat and drooping the old man i have mentioned the one with long sunburnt hair and buckskin shirt and who seemed a sort of aide or lieutenant to father rode close to our wagon and indicated the jaded with a cock of his head not sparin horseflesh captain he muttered in a low voice an what in the name of sam hill are they for if it ain't for us but my father had already noted the condition of the two animals and my eager eyes had seen him and i had seen his eyes flash his lips tighten and haggard lines form for a moment on his dusty face that was all but i put two and two together and knew that the two tired saddle horses were just one more added touch of ominousness to the situation i guess they're keeping an eye on us laban was my father's sole comment it was at fillmore that i saw a man that i was to see again he was a tall man well on in middle age with all the evidence of good health and immense strength strength not alone of body but of will unlike most men i was accustomed to about me he was several days growth of beard showed that he was already his mouth was unusually wide with thin lips tightly compressed as if he had lost many of his front teeth his nose was large square and thick so was his face square wide between the cheekbones underhung with massive jaws and topped with a broad intelligent forehead and the eyes rather small a little more than the width of an eye apart were the bluest blue i had ever seen it was at the at fillmore that i first saw this man father with several of our company had gone there to try to buy flour and i disobeying my mother in my curiosity to see more of our enemies had tagged along unperceived this man was one of four or five who stood in a group with the miller during the interview you seen that old cuss laban said to father after we had got outside and were returning to camp father nodded well that's lee laban continued i seen'm in salt lake he's a regular got nineteen wives and fifty children they all say an he's rank crazy on religion now what's he followin us up for through this country our weary doomed drifting went on the little settlements wherever water and soil permitted were from twenty to fifty miles apart between stretched the barrenness of sand and alkali and drought and at every settlement our peaceful attempts to buy food were vain they denied us harshly and wanted to know who of us had sold them food when we drove them from missouri it was useless on our part to tell them we were from arkansas from arkansas we truly were but they insisted on our being missourians chapter ii the effect of my visit to bridges was to turn me out for more profundity hugh vereker as i saw him there was of a contact so void of angles that i blushed for the poverty of imagination involved in my small precautions if he was in spirits it because he had read my review in fact on the sunday morning i felt sure he read it though the middle had been out three days and bloomed i assured myself in the stiff garden of periodicals which gave one of the ormolu tables the air of a stand at a station the impression he made on me personally was such that i wished him to read it and i corrected to this end with a surreptitious hand what might be wanting in the careless conspicuity of the sheet afraid i even watched the result of my manœuvre but up to luncheon i watched in vain when afterwards in the course of our gregarious walk i found myself for half an hour not perhaps without another manœuvre at the great side the result of his affability was a still livelier desire that he remain in ignorance of the peculiar justice i had done him it that he seemed to thirst for justice on the contrary i yet caught in his talk the faintest grunt of a grudge a note for which my young experience had already given me an ear of late he had had more recognition and it was pleasant as we used to say in the middle to see how it drew him out he of course popular but i judged one of the sources of his good humour to be precisely that his success was independent of that he had none the less become in a manner the fashion the critics at least had put on a spurt and caught up with him we had found out at last how clever he was and he had had to make the best of the loss of his mystery i was strongly tempted as i walked beside him to let him know how much of that unveiling was my act and there was a moment when i probably should have done so had not one of the ladies of our party snatching a place at his other elbow just then appealed to him in a spirit comparatively selfish it was very discouraging i almost felt the liberty had been taken with myself i had had on my end for my own part a phrase or two about the right word at the right time but later on i was glad not to have spoken for when on our return we clustered at tea i perceived lady jane who had not been out with us brandishing the middle with her longest arm she had taken it up at her leisure she was delighted with what she had found and i saw that as a mistake in a man may often be a felicity in a woman she would practically do for me what i been able to do for myself some sweet little truths that needed to be spoken i heard her declare thrusting the paper at rather a bewildered couple by the fireplace she grabbed it away from them again on the reappearance of hugh vereker who after our walk had been upstairs to change something i know you in general look at this kind of thing but an occasion really for doing so you seen it then you must the man has actually got at you at what i always feel you know lady jane threw into her eyes a look evidently intended to give an idea of what she always felt but she added that she have expressed it the man in the paper expressed it in a striking manner just see there and there where dashed it how he brings it out she had literally marked for him the brightest patches of my prose and if i was a little amused vereker himself may well have been he showed how much he was when before us all lady jane wanted to read something aloud i liked at any rate the way he defeated her purpose by jerking the paper affectionately out of her clutch take it upstairs with him and look at it on going to dress he did this half an hour later i saw it in his hand when he repaired to his room that was the moment at which thinking to give her pleasure i mentioned to lady jane that i was the author of the review i did give her pleasure i judged but perhaps not quite so much as i had expected if the author was only me the thing seem quite so remarkable i had the effect rather of diminishing the lustre of the article than of adding to my own her ladyship was subject to the most extraordinary drops it matter the only effect i cared about was the one it would have on vereker up there by his bedroom fire i he had been told the ladies were at church but this was corrected by what he saw from the top of the steps they descended from a great height in two arms with a circular sweep of the most charming effect at the threshold of the door which from the long bright gallery overlooked the immense lawn three gentlemen on the grass at a distance sat under the great trees while the fourth figure showed a crimson dress that told as a bit of colour amid the fresh rich green the servant had so far accompanied paul overt as to introduce him to this view after asking him if he wished first to go to his room the young man declined that privilege conscious of no disrepair from so short and easy a journey and always liking to take at once a general perceptive possession of a new scene he stood there a little with his eyes on the group and on the admirable picture the wide grounds of an old near london that only made it better on a splendid sunday in june but that lady she he said to the servant before the man left him i think mrs st george sir mrs st george the wife of the distinguished then paul overt checked himself doubting if a footman would know yes sir probably sir said his guide who appeared to wish to intimate that a person staying at summersoft would naturally be if only by alliance distinguished his tone however made poor overt himself feel for the moment scantly so and the gentlemen overt went on well sir one of general fancourt ah yes i know thank you general fancourt was distinguished there was no doubt of that for something he had done or perhaps even done the young man remember which some years before in india the servant went away leaving the glass doors open into the gallery and paul overt remained at the head of the wide double staircase saying to himself that the place was sweet and promised a pleasant visit while he leaned on the balustrade of fine old ironwork which like all the other details was of the same period as the house it all went together and spoke in one voice a rich english voice of the early part of the eighteenth century it might have been on a day in the reign of queen anne the stillness was too perfect to be modern the nearness counted so as distance and there was something so fresh and sound in the originality of the large smooth house the expanse of beautiful brickwork that showed for pink rather than red and that had been kept clear of messy creepers by the law under which a woman with a rare complexion disdains a veil when paul overt became aware that the people under the trees had noticed him he turned back through the open doors into the great gallery which was the pride of the place it marched across from end to end and seemed with its bright colours its high panelled windows its faded flowered chintzes its portraits and pictures the china of its cabinets and the attenuated festoons and rosettes of its ceiling a cheerful upholstered avenue into the other century our friend was slightly nervous that went with his character as a student of fine prose went with the general disposition to vibrate and there was a particular thrill in the idea that henry st george might be a member of the party for the young aspirant he had remained a high literary figure in spite of the lower range of production to which he had fallen after his first three great successes the comparative absence of quality in his later work there had been moments when paul overt almost shed tears for this but now that he was near him he had never met him he was conscious only of the fine original source and of his own immense debt after he had taken a turn or two up and down the gallery he came out again and descended the steps he was but slenderly supplied with a certain social boldness it was really a weakness in him so that conscious of a want of acquaintance with the four persons in the distance he gave way to motions recommended by their not committing him to a positive approach there was a fine english awkwardness in this he felt that too as he sauntered vaguely and obliquely across the lawn taking an independent line fortunately there was an equally fine english directness in the way one of the gentlemen presently rose and made as if to stalk him though with an air of conciliation and reassurance to this demonstration paul overt instantly responded even if the gentleman were not his host he was tall straight and elderly and had like the great house itself a pink smiling face and into the bargain a white moustache our young man met him halfway while he laughed and said er lady watermouth told us you were coming she asked me just to look after you paul overt thanked him liking him on the spot and turned round with him to walk toward the others all gone to church all except us the stranger continued as they went just sitting here so jolly overt pronounced it jolly indeed it was such a lovely place he mentioned that he was having the charming impression for the first time the millennium fulcrum edition a man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern alabama looking down into the swift water twenty feet below the man's hands were behind his back the wrists bound with a cord a rope closely encircled his neck it was attached to a stout above his head and the slack fell to the level of his knees some loose boards laid upon the ties supporting the rails of the railway supplied a footing for him and his executioners two private soldiers of the federal army directed by a sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy sheriff at a short remove upon the same temporary platform was an officer in the uniform of his rank armed he was a captain a sentinel at each end of the bridge stood with his rifle in the position known as support that is to say vertical in front of the left shoulder the hammer resting on the forearm thrown straight across the chest a formal and unnatural position enforcing an erect carriage of the body it did not appear to be the duty of these two men to know what was occurring at the center of the bridge they merely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking that traversed it beyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight the railroad ran straight away into a forest for a hundred yards then curving was lost to view doubtless there was an outpost farther along the other bank of the stream was open ground a gentle slope topped with a stockade of vertical tree trunks loopholed for rifles with a single embrasure through which protruded the muzzle of a brass cannon commanding the bridge midway up the slope between the bridge and fort were the spectators a single company of infantry in line at parade rest the butts of their rifles on the ground the barrels inclining slightly backward against the right shoulder the hands crossed upon the stock a lieutenant stood at the right of the line the point of his sword upon the ground his left hand resting upon his right excepting the group of four at the center of the bridge not a man moved the company faced the bridge staring stonily motionless the sentinels facing the banks of the stream might have been statues to adorn the bridge the captain stood with folded arms silent observing the work of his subordinates but making no sign death is a dignitary who when he comes announced is to be received with formal manifestations of respect even by those most familiar with him in the code of military etiquette silence and fixity are forms of deference the man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about years of age he was a civilian if one might judge from his habit which was that of a planter his features were good a straight nose firm mouth broad forehead from which his long dark hair was combed straight back falling behind his ears to the collar of his well fitting frock coat he wore a moustache and pointed beard but no whiskers his eyes were large and dark gray and had a kindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose neck was in the hemp evidently this was no vulgar assassin the liberal military code makes provision for hanging many kinds of persons and gentlemen are not excluded the preparations being complete the two private soldiers stepped aside and each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing the sergeant turned to the captain saluted and placed himself immediately behind that officer who in turn moved apart one pace these movements left the condemned man and the sergeant standing on the two ends of the same plank which spanned three of the of the bridge the end upon which the civilian stood almost but not quite reached a fourth this plank had been held in place by the weight of the captain it was now held by that of the sergeant at a signal from the former the latter would step aside the plank would tilt and the condemned man go down between two ties the arrangement commended itself to his judgement as simple and effective his face had not been covered nor his eyes bandaged he looked a moment at his unsteadfast footing then let his gaze wander to the swirling water of the stream racing madly beneath his feet a piece of dancing driftwood caught his attention and his eyes followed it down the current how slowly it appeared to move what a sluggish stream he closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and children the water touched to gold by the early sun the brooding mists under the banks at some distance down the stream the fort the soldiers the piece of drift all had distracted him and now he became conscious of a new disturbance striking through the thought of his dear ones was sound which he could neither ignore nor understand a sharp distinct metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith's hammer upon the anvil it had the same ringing quality he wondered what it was and whether immeasurably distant or near by it seemed both its recurrence was regular but as slow as the tolling of a death knell he awaited each new stroke with impatience and he knew not why apprehension the intervals of silence grew progressively longer the delays became maddening with their greater infrequency the sounds increased in strength and sharpness they hurt his ear like the thrust of a knife he feared he would shriek what he heard was the ticking of his watch a centurion of the thirtieth cities and thrones and powers stand in time's eye almost

juts out of far wood just as far wood juts out of the hillside pook's hill lay below her and all the turns of the brook as it wanders out of the willingford woods between to old hobden's cottage at the forge the wind there is always a wind by volaterrae blew from the bare ridge where cherry clack windmill stands now wind prowling through woods sounds like exciting things going to happen and that is why on blowy days you stand up in volaterrae and shout bits of the lays to suit its noises una took dan's catapult from its secret place and made ready to meet lars porsena's army stealing through the aspens by the brook a gust boomed up the valley and una chanted sorrowfully verbenna down to ostia hath wasted all the plain astur hath stormed janiculum and the stout guards are slain but the wind not charging fair to the wood started aside and shook a single oak in gleason's pasture here it made itself all small and crouched among the grasses waving the tips of them as a cat waves the tip of her tail before she springs now welcome welcome sextus sang una loading the catapult now welcome to thy home why dost thou stay and turn away here lies the road to rome she fired into the face of the lull to wake up the cowardly wind and heard a grunt from behind a thorn in the pasture oh my winkie she said aloud and that was something she had picked up from dan i b'lieve i've tickled up a gleason cow you little painted beast a voice cried i'll teach you to sling your masters she looked down most cautiously and saw a young man covered with hoopy bronze armour all glowing among the late broom but what una admired beyond all was his great bronze helmet with a red that flicked in the wind she could hear the long hairs rasp on his shimmery what does the faun mean he said half aloud to himself by telling me that the painted people have changed he caught sight of una's yellow head have you seen a painted he called said una but if you've seen a bullet seen cried the man it passed within a hair's breadth of my ear well that was me i'm most awfully sorry didn't the faun tell you i was coming he smiled not if you mean puck i thought you were a gleason cow i i didn't know you were a a what are you he laughed outright showing a set of splendid teeth his face and eyes were dark and his eyebrows met above his big nose in one bushy black bar they call me parnesius i have been a centurion of the seventh cohort of the thirtieth legion the ulpia victrix did you sling that bullet i did i was using dan's catapult said una catapults said he i ought to know something about them show me he leaped the rough fence with a rattle of spear shield and armour and hoisted himself into volaterrae as quickly as a shadow a sling on a forked stick i understand he cried and pulled at the elastic but what wonderful beast yields this stretching leather it's laccy elastic you put the bullet into that loop and then you pull hard the man pulled and hit himself square on his thumbnail each to his own weapon he said gravely handing it back i am better with the bigger machine little maiden but it's a pretty toy a wolf would laugh at it aren't you afraid of wolves there aren't any said una never believe it a wolf's like a winged hat he comes when he isn't expected don't they hunt wolves here chapter xvi george waldeaux took his mother and boy back to the old homestead in delaware they arrived at night and early the next morning he rowed away in his bateau to some of his old haunts in the woods on the bay and was seen no more that day he is inconsolable his mother told some of her old neighbors who crowded to welcome her his heart is in that grave in vannes the women listened in surprise for frances was not in the habit of exploiting her emotions in words we understood said one of them with a sympathetic shake of the head that it was a pure love match mrs george waldeaux we heard was a french artist of remarkable beauty frances moved uneasily i never thought her but i can't discuss lisa she was silent a moment but as for her social position she drew herself up stiffly fixing cold defiant eyes on her questioner as for her social position she went on resolutely she was descended on one side from an excellent american family and on the other from one of the noblest houses in europe when they were gone she hugged little jacques passionately as he lay on her lap that is settled for you she said when george came back in the evening he found her walking with the boy in her arms on the broad piazzas i really think he knows that he has come home george she exclaimed see how he laughs and he liked the dogs and horses just as lisa thought he would i am glad it is such a beautiful home for him look at that slope to the bay there is no nobler park in england and the house is as big as most of their palaces and much more comfortable give the child to colette mother and listen to me now that i have settled you and him here i must go and earn your living yes she followed him into the hall i leave you there is no time to be lost you are going back to art george no never frances grew pale she thought she had torn open his gaping wound i did not mean to remind you of of no it isn't that he scowled at the fire art meant for him his own countless daubs and the sickening smell of oily paints and musk and soiled silk tea gowns and the whole slovenly disreputable scramble of bohemian life in paris i loathe art he said with a furious blow at the smouldering log in the fireplace as if he struck these things all down into the ashes with it will you go back into the church dear his mother ventured timidly most certainly no he said vehemently of all mean frauds the perfunctory priest is the meanest if i could be like one of the old holy gospellers then indeed he was silent a moment and then began to stride up and down the long hall his head thrown back his chest inflated i have a message for the world mother i am sure of it she interrupted eagerly but i must deliver it in my own way i have lost two years i am going to put in big strokes of work now in the next two years i intend to take my proper place in my own country i will find standing room for george waldeaux with a complacent smile and in the meantime of course i must make money enough to support you and the boy handsomely so you see mother he ended laughing i have no time to lose no george it was the proudest moment of her life how heroic and generous he was she filled his the next day when he went to new york to take the world by the throat it was really not george waldeaux's fault that she filled it nor was it his fault that during the next two years the world was in no hurry to run to his feet either to learn of him or to bring him its bags of gold the little man did his best he put his message as he called it into poems into essays into a novel publishers thanked him effusively for the pleasure of reading them and sent them back the only word of his which reached the public was a review of the work of a successful author it was so personal so malignant that george when he read it writhed with shame and humiliation he tore the paper into fragments am i so envious and small as that before god no words of mine shall ever go into print again he said and he kept his word he came down every month or two to his mother why not try teaching george she said anxiously these great scholars and scientific men have places and reputations which even you need not despise he laughed bitterly i tried for a place as tutor in a school and could not pass the examinations i know nothing accurately nothing it occurred to him to go into politics and help reform the world by routing a certain irish boss he made a speech at a ward meeting and broke

degrees w on january the fifth that is eleven months and four days after my uncle edward prendick a private gentleman who certainly went aboard the lady vain at callao and who had been considered drowned was picked up in latitude degrees s and longitude degrees w in a small open boat of which the name was illegible but which is supposed to have belonged to the missing schooner ipecacuanha he gave such a strange account of himself that he was supposed demented subsequently he alleged that his mind was a blank from the moment of his escape from the lady vain his case was discussed among psychologists at the time as a curious instance of the lapse of memory consequent upon physical and mental stress the following narrative was found among his papers by the undersigned his nephew and heir but unaccompanied by any definite request for publication the only island known to exist in the region in which my uncle was picked up is noble's isle a small volcanic islet and uninhabited it was visited in by h m s scorpion a party of sailors then landed but found nothing living thereon except certain curious white moths some hogs and rabbits and some rather peculiar rats so that this narrative is without confirmation in its most essential particular with that understood there seems no harm in putting this strange story before the public in accordance as i believe with my uncle's intentions there is at least this much in its behalf my uncle passed out of human knowledge about latitude degrees s and longitude degrees e and reappeared in the same part of the ocean after a space of eleven months in some way he must have lived during the interval and it seems that a schooner called the ipecacuanha with a drunken captain john davies did start from africa with a puma and certain other animals aboard in january that the vessel was well known at several ports in the south pacific and that it finally disappeared from those seas with a considerable amount of copra aboard sailing to its unknown fate from bayna in december a date that tallies entirely with my uncle's story charles edward prendick the story written by edward prendick i in the dingey of the lady vain i do not propose to add anything to what has already been written concerning the loss of the lady vain as everyone knows she collided with a derelict when ten days out from callao the longboat with seven of the crew was picked up eighteen days after by h m gunboat myrtle and the story of their terrible privations has become quite as well known as the far more horrible medusa case but i have to add to the published story of the lady vain another possibly as horrible and far stranger it has hitherto been supposed that the four men who were in the dingey perished but this is incorrect i have the best of evidence for this assertion i was one of the four men but in the first place i must state that there never were four men in the dingey the number was three constans who was seen by the captain to jump into the gig luckily for us and unluckily for himself did not reach us he came down out of the tangle of ropes under the stays of the smashed bowsprit some small rope caught his heel as he let go and he hung for a moment head downward and then fell and struck a block or spar floating in the water we pulled towards him but he never came up daily news march i say luckily for us he did not reach us and i might almost say luckily for himself for we had only a small beaker of water and some soddened ship's biscuits with us so sudden had been the alarm so unprepared the ship for any disaster we thought the people on the launch would be better provisioned though it seems they were not and we tried to hail them they could not have heard us and the next morning when the drizzle cleared which was not until past midday we could see nothing of them we could not stand up to look about us because of the pitching of the boat the two other men who had escaped so far with me were a man named helmar a passenger like myself and a seaman whose name i don't know a short sturdy man with a stammer melmoth reconciled there is a special variety of human nature obtained in the social kingdom by a process analogous to that of the craft in the vegetable kingdom to wit by the a species of hybrid which can be raised neither from seed nor from slips this product is known as the cashier an anthropomorphous growth watered by religious doctrine trained up in fear of the guillotine pruned by vice to flourish on a third floor with an estimable wife by his side and an uninteresting family

freaks in the making of a mind she indulges herself and makes a few honest folk now and again and now and then a cashier wherefore that race of corsairs whom we dignify with the title of bankers the gentry who take out a license for which they pay a thousand crowns as the privateer takes out his letters of marque hold these rare products of the incubations of virtue in such esteem that they confine them in cages in their much as governments procure and maintain specimens of strange beasts at their own charges if the cashier is possessed of an imagination or of a fervid temperament if as will sometimes happen to the most complete cashier he loves his wife and that wife grows tired of her lot has ambitions or merely some vanity in her composition the cashier is undone search the chronicles of the you will not find a single instance of a cashier attaining a position as it is called they are sent to the hulks they go to foreign parts they vegetate on a second floor in the rue among the market gardens of the marais some day when the cashiers of paris come to a sense of their real value a cashier will be hardly obtainable for money still certain it is that there are people who are fit for nothing but to be cashiers just as the bent of a certain order of mind inevitably makes for rascality but oh marvel of our civilization society rewards virtue with an income of a hundred louis in old age a dwelling on a second floor bread sufficient occasional new bandana handkerchiefs an elderly wife and her offspring so much for virtue but for the opposite course a little boldness a faculty for keeping on the windward side of the law as turenne outflanked montecuculi and society will sanction the theft of millions shower ribbons upon the thief cram him with honors and smother him with consideration government moreover works harmoniously with this profoundly illogical reasoner society government levies a conscription on the young intelligence of the kingdom at the age of seventeen or eighteen a conscription of precocious before it is sent up to be submitted to a process of selection nurserymen sort and select seeds in much the same way to this process the government brings professional appraisers of talent men who can assay brains as experts assay gold at the mint five hundred such heads set afire with hope are sent up annually by the most progressive portion of the population and of these the government takes puts them in sacks called the ecoles and shakes them up together for three years though every one of these young plants represents vast productive power they are made as one may say into cashiers they receive appointments the rank and file of engineers is made up of them they are employed as captains of artillery there is no subaltern grade to which they may not aspire finally when these men the pick of the youth of the nation fattened on mathematics and stuffed with knowledge have attained the age of fifty years they have their reward and receive as the price of their services the lodging the wife and family and all the comforts that sweeten life for mediocrity if from among this race of dupes there should escape some five

absolutely centered upon his own silly self if anything could have driven me from gladys it would have been the thought of such a i am convinced that he really believed in his heart that i came round to the chestnuts three days a week for the pleasure of his company and very especially to hear his views upon bimetallism a subject upon which he was by way of being an authority for an hour or more that evening i listened to his monotonous chirrup about bad money driving out good the token value of silver the depreciation of the rupee and the true standards of exchange suppose he cried with feeble violence that all the debts in the world were called up simultaneously and immediate payment insisted upon what under our present conditions would happen then i gave the answer that i should be a ruined man upon which he jumped from his chair reproved me for my habitual levity which made it impossible for him to discuss any reasonable subject in my presence and bounced off out of the room to dress for a masonic meeting at last i was alone with gladys and the moment of fate had come all that evening i had felt like the soldier who awaits the signal which will send him on a forlorn hope hope of victory and fear of repulse alternating in his mind she sat with that proud delicate profile of hers outlined against the red curtain how beautiful she was and yet how aloof we had been friends quite good friends but never could i get beyond the same comradeship which i might have established with one of my upon the gazette perfectly frank perfectly kindly and perfectly unsexual my instincts are all against a woman being too frank and at her ease with me it is no compliment to a man where the real sex feeling begins timidity and distrust are its companions heritage from old wicked days when love and violence went often hand in hand the bent head the averted eye the faltering voice the wincing figure these and not the unshrinking gaze and frank reply are the true signals of passion even in my short life i had learned as much as that or had inherited it in that race memory which we call instinct gladys was full of every womanly quality some judged her to be cold and hard but such a thought was treason that delicately bronzed skin almost oriental in its coloring that raven hair the large liquid eyes the full but exquisite lips all the stigmata of passion were there but i was sadly conscious that up to now i had never found the secret of drawing it forth however come what might i should have done with suspense and bring matters to a head she could but refuse me and better be a repulsed lover than an accepted brother so far my thoughts had carried me and i was about to break the long and uneasy silence when two critical dark eyes looked round at me and the proud head was shaken in smiling reproof i have a presentiment that you are going to propose ned i do wish you wouldn't for things are so much nicer as they are i drew my chair a little nearer now how did you know that i was going to propose i asked in genuine wonder don't women always know do you suppose any woman in the world was ever taken unawares but oh ned our friendship has been so good and so pleasant what a pity to spoil it don't you feel how splendid it is that a young man and a young woman should be able to talk face to face as we have talked i don't know gladys you see i can talk face to face with with the i can't imagine how that official came into the matter but in he trotted and set us both laughing that does not satisfy me in the least i want my arms round you and your head on my breast and oh gladys i want how the grand gallipoot joined the nomes after leaving the whimsies guph continued on his journey and penetrated far into the northwest he wanted to get to the country of the growleywogs and in order to do that he must cross the ripple land which was a hard thing to do for the ripple land was a succession of hills and valleys all very steep and rocky and they changed places constantly by rippling while guph was climbing a hill it sank down under him and became a valley and while he was descending into a valley it rose up and carried him to the top of a hill this was very perplexing to the traveler and a stranger might have thought he could never cross the ripple land at all but guph knew that if he kept steadily on he would get to the end at last so he paid no attention to the changing hills and valleys and plodded along as calmly as if walking upon the level ground the result of this wise persistence was that the general finally reached firmer soil and after penetrating a dense forest came to the dominion of the growleywogs no sooner had he crossed the border of this domain when two guards seized him and carried him before the grand gallipoot of the growleywogs who scowled upon him ferociously and asked him why he dared intrude upon his territory i'm the lord high general of the invincible army of the nomes and my name is guph was the reply all the world trembles when that name is mentioned the growleywogs gave a shout of jeering laughter at this and one of them caught the nome in his strong arms and tossed him high into the air guph was considerably shaken when he fell upon the hard ground but he appeared to take no notice of the impertinence and composed himself to speak again to the grand gallipoot my master king roquat the red has sent me here to confer with you he wishes your assistance to conquer the land of oz here the general paused and the grand gallipoot scowled upon him more terribly than ever and said go on the voice of the grand gallipoot was partly a roar and partly a growl he mumbled his words badly and guph had to listen carefully in order to understand him these growleywogs were certainly remarkable creatures they were of gigantic size yet were all bone and skin and muscle there being no meat or fat upon their bodies at all their powerful muscles lay just underneath their skins like bunches of tough rope and the weakest growleywog was so strong that he could pick up an elephant and toss it seven miles away it seems unfortunate that strong people are usually so disagreeable and overbearing that no one cares for them in fact to be different from your fellow creatures is always a misfortune the growleywogs knew that they were disliked and avoided by every one so they had become surly and unsociable even among themselves guph knew that they hated all people including the nomes but he hoped to win them over nevertheless and knew that if he succeeded they would afford him very powerful assistance the land of oz is ruled by a girl who is disgustingly kind and good he continued her people are all happy and contented and have no care or worries whatever go on growled the grand gallipoot once the nome king enslaved the royal family of ev another lot that we detest said the general but ozma interfered although it was none of her business and marched her army against us with her was a kansas girl named dorothy and a yellow hen and they marched directly into the nome king's cavern there they liberated our slaves from ev and stole king roquat's magic belt which they carried away with them so now our king is making a tunnel under the deadly desert so we can march through it to the emerald city when we get there we mean to conquer and destroy all the land and recapture the magic belt again he paused and again the grand gallipoot growled go on guph tried to think what to say next and a happy thought soon occurred to him we want you to help us in this conquest he announced for we need the mighty aid of the growleywogs in order to make sure that we shall not be defeated you are the strongest people in all the world and you hate good and happy creatures as much as we nomes do i am sure it will be a real pleasure to you to tear down the beautiful emerald city and in return for your valuable assistance we will allow you to bring back to your country ten thousand people of oz to be your slaves twenty thousand growled the grand gallipoot all right we promise you twenty thousand agreed the general the gallipoot made a signal and at once his attendants picked up general guph and carried him away to a prison where the jailer amused himself by sticking pins in the round fat body of the old nome to see him jump and hear him yell christmas concert it was several nights before christmas and all along the freeway cars were lined up like a vast herd of reindeer being led off to slaughter i glanced away from the sight and reached out to snap off the radio i'd had far too much of the messiah since thanksgiving you'd think a respectable classical station could think of something more original to saturate the airwaves with but i knew that even if i changed the station i'd get white christmas or blue christmas or dixie christmas or some other form of musical blasphemy traffic moved along sluggishly inching up a long curving hill it was raining heavily one of those sudden tropical storms only it was happening in a refrigerator i had the windshield wipers on full but still i could hardly see the vehicle in front of me along with every other irate father uncle brother and son who was late for some engagement or another i was in the fast lane i had gotten caught in a sales meeting and i was going to be late for my daughter's concert if the idiot in front of me didn't hurry up the offending car was a jeep jacked up on all fours with tires big enough to dwarf a and had struts and shock absorbers and sticking out all over the undercarriage a real useful piece of machinery for navigating the treacherous silicon valley freeways when you see a car you don't like you just roll right over it the jeep had one of those typical california vanity plates held in place by a brass frame which had i been able to read it in the dark would have said my other truck is a mack the driver was pumping on his brakes continually no doubt keeping time to some country christmas hit classic lounging on top of this pinnacle of western automotive engineering was a christmas tree lashed with a couple pieces of thin twine probably on its way to a living room hung with paintings of nudes on black velvet and soon to be littered with tacky country decorations and strings of popcorn the tree listed to one side bobbing over the edge of the jeep's roof in time with the blinking brake lights the driver's girlfriend was smooching up to him in the front seat i could see her outline through the back window practically sitting in his lap maybe she was in his lap i started thinking they probably deserved to lose the whole tree they'd have a real nice surprise when they got home without it i reached over to turn on the radio again thinking the hourly excerpt from the messiah might be over by then i should have brought a tape from home but i'd barely had time to change my suit just when my eyes were averted for an instant the bedecked vehicle in front of me decided to drop its load i felt my car go bump bump and slammed on my brakes before i even looked up the car behind me skidded and swerved to one side then leaned on his horn as if he'd run into an iceberg i just hit the emergency lights and leaned on my own horn the guy in front perhaps hearing the tooting chorus behind him stopped just down the road and like an idiot put his jeep into reverse and came hurtling back toward me he skidded to a stop and put on his emergency lights what kind of jerk ties down a christmas tree so loosely that it flops off in the middle of a freeway we were only doing twenty miles an hour in the rain no less i thought i would have to get out and check the extent of the damage and i wasn't happy about slogging in the rain with my dress shoes on hallelujah the jerk stopped anyway so i could at least get the name of his insurance company i'd already memorized his personal license number which doesn't bear repeating i'd always thought the dmv had standards of decency i hopped out trying to pull up the collar of my overcoat even though it wouldn't quite cover my head and started walking forward to have a few choice words with mister country jamboree in the automobile of course cj as i then dubbed the driver bounded out of the jeep and headed my way tucking in his shirt as he walked one look at him and i almost turned around and left cj could have been paul bunyan's twin brother he had the shirt to prove it too red and black lumberjack style checks with the top three buttons undone and chest hair that was thicker than my beard he also wore cowboy boots and wide red suspenders holy moley mister he yelled with a tone of real concern you alright i was about to lay into him when his girlfriend appeared from behind tucking herself into his armpit oh she squealed ah'm so sorry looks like our tree smashed up your brand new car my car wasn't exactly brand new but i looked around to where she pointed sure enough the front grill was bent in and one headlight had gone out the glass completely smashed the tree itself was nestled cozily under the car nuzzling up against the oil pan chapter ix was an atavism he was the great discordant element in our horde he was more primitive than any of us he did not belong with us yet we were still so primitive ourselves that we were incapable of a cooperative effort strong enough to kill him or cast him out rude as was our social organization he was nevertheless too rude to live in it he tended always to destroy the horde by his unsocial acts he was really a reversion to an earlier type and his place was with the tree people rather than with us who were in the process of becoming men he was a monster of cruelty which is saying a great deal in that day he beat his wives not that he ever had more than one wife at a time but that he was married many times it was impossible for any woman to live with him and yet they did live with him out of compulsion there was no gainsaying him no man was strong enough to stand against him often do i have visions of the quiet hour before the twilight from and carrot patch and berry swamp the folk are trooping into the open space before the caves they dare linger no later than this for the dreadful darkness is approaching in which the world is given over to the carnage of the hunting animals while the of man hide tremblingly in their holes there yet remain to us a few minutes before we climb to our caves we are tired from the play of the day and the sounds we make are subdued even the cubs still greedy for fun and antics play with restraint the wind from the sea has died down and the shadows are lengthening with the last of the descent and then suddenly from cave breaks a wild screaming and the sound of blows he is beating his wife at first an awed silence comes upon us but as the blows and screams continue we break out into an insane gibbering of helpless rage it is plain that the men resent actions but they are too afraid of him the blows cease and a low groaning dies away while we chatter among ourselves and the sad twilight creeps upon us we to whom most happenings were jokes never laughed during we knew too well the tragedy of them on more than one morning at the base of the cliff did we find the body of his latest wife he had tossed her there after she had died from his he never buried his dead the task of carrying away the bodies that else would have polluted our he left to the horde we usually flung them into the river below the last not alone did murder his wives but he also murdered for his wives in order to get them when he wanted a new wife and selected the wife of another man he promptly killed that man two of these murders i saw myself the whole horde knew but could do nothing we had not yet developed any government to speak of inside the horde we had certain customs and visited our wrath upon the unlucky ones who violated those customs thus for example the individual who defiled a would be attacked by every onlooker while one who deliberately gave a false alarm was the recipient of much rough usage at our hands but walked over all our customs and we so feared him that we were incapable of the collective action necessary to punish him it was during the sixth winter in our cave that and i discovered that we were really growing up from the first it had been a squeeze to get in through the this had had its advantages however it had prevented the larger folk from taking our cave away from us and it was a most desirable cave the highest on the bluff the safest and in winter the smallest and warmest to show the stage of the mental development of the folk i may state that it would have been a simple thing for some of them to have driven us out and enlarged the but they never thought of it and i did not think of it either until our increasing size compelled us to make an enlargement this occurred when summer was well along and we were fat with better forage we worked at the crevice in spells when the fancy struck us at first we dug the crumbling rocks away with our fingers until our nails got sore when i accidentally stumbled upon the idea of using a piece of wood on the rock this worked well also it worked woe one morning early we had scratched out of the wall quite a heap of fragments i gave the heap a shove over the lip of the entrance the next moment there came up from below a howl of rage there was no need to look we knew the voice only too well the rubbish had descended upon chapter xxii a week is gone le jour des noces arrived the marriage was solemnized at st jacques mdlle zoraide became madame pelet nee reuter and in about an hour after this transformation the happy pair as newspapers phrase it were on their way to paris where according to previous arrangement the honeymoon was to be spent the next day i quitted the pensionnat myself and my chattels some books and clothes were soon transferred to a modest lodging i had hired in a street not far off in half an hour my clothes were arranged in a commode my books on a shelf and the flitting was effected i should not have been unhappy that day had not one pang tortured me a longing to go to the rue notre dame aux neiges resisted yet irritated by an inward resolve to avoid that street till such time as the mist of doubt should clear from my prospects it was a sweet september evening very mild very still i had nothing to do at that hour i knew frances would be equally released from occupation i thought she might possibly be wishing for her master i knew i wished for my pupil imagination began with her low whispers infusing into my soul the soft tale of pleasures that might be you will find her reading or writing said she you can take your seat

be you can seal her lips and veil her bright countenance with diffidence yet you know she is not all monotonous mildness you have seen with a sort of strange pleasure revolt scorn austerity bitterness lay energetic claim to a place in her feelings and physiognomy you know that few could rule her as you do you know she might break but never bend under the hand of tyranny and injustice but reason and affection can guide her by a sign try their influence now go they are not passions you may handle them safely i will not go was my answer to the sweet temptress a man is master of himself to a certain point but not beyond it could i seek frances could i sit with her alone in a quiet room and address her only in the language of reason and affection no was the brief fervent reply of that love which had conquered and now controlled me time seemed to stagnate the sun would not go down my watch ticked but i thought the hands were paralyzed what a hot evening i cried throwing open the lattice for indeed i had seldom felt so feverish hearing a step ascending the common stair i wondered whether the locataire now mounting to his apartments were as unsettled in mind and condition as i was or whether he lived in the calm of certain resources and in the freedom of unfettered feelings what was he coming in person to solve the problem hardly proposed in inaudible thought he had actually knocked at the door at my door a smart prompt rap and almost before i could invite him in he was over the threshold and had closed the door behind him and how are you asked an indifferent quiet voice in the english language while my visitor without any sort of bustle or introduction put his hat on the table and his gloves into his hat and drawing the only armchair the room afforded a little forward seated himself tranquilly therein you speak he inquired in a few moments in a tone whose nonchalance seemed to intimate that it was much the same thing whether i answered or not the fact is i found it desirable to have recourse to my good friends les besicles not exactly to ascertain the identity of my visitor for i already knew him confound his impudence but to see how he looked to get a clear notion of his mien and countenance i wiped the glasses very deliberately and put them on quite as deliberately adjusting them so as not to hurt the bridge of my nose or get entangled in my short tufts of dun hair i was sitting in the with my back to the light and i had him a position he would much rather have had reversed for at any time he preferred scrutinizing to being scrutinized yes it was he and no mistake with his six feet of length arranged in a sitting attitude with his dark travelling surtout with its velvet collar his gray pantaloons his black stock and his face the most original one nature ever modelled yet the least obtrusively so not one feature that could be termed marked or odd yet the effect of the whole unique there is no use in attempting to describe what is indescribable being in no hurry to address him i sat and stared at my ease plaerdemavida by the great mercy of god plaerdemavida was saved from the shipwreck and taken to the city of tunis to the house of a fisherman's daughter as was related previously then after two years had passed the fisherman's daughter took a husband near that city and while they held plaerdemavida captive there she always lived very honestly working gold and silk as the maidens of greece are accustomed to doing it happened one day that her mistress went to the city of montagata and left plaerdemavida to watch the house she had gone to the city to make some purchases and while she was there she went to talk to the king's daughter and she told her my lady i've been told that you are planning to marry and that you are supplying yourself with blouses embroidered with gold and silk and other things proper for maidens i have a young slave who is able to do what i have taught her from the time she was an infant to embroider all manner of things as befits young women here are some samples of what she can do if you want her i will give her to you for one hundred doubloons even though i will be losing all the training i have given her the princess seeing the samples wanted her very much and she said that she would be happy to give her the one hundred doubloons the moor said i'll be glad to give her to you for that price on one condition you must tell her that i have loaned her to you for two months because if she guessed that i had sold her she would be so sad that she would fall into despair plaerdemavida was placed in her hands and she came to love the princess very much it happened a short time later that the city was attacked and the moors took many christians prisoner among the men they captured was a soldier who had been an oarsman on tirant's galley when it was lost plaerdemavida recognized him and she said aren't you one of the christians who were on tirant's galley when it went down at sea my lady said the man it's true i was there and i nearly drowned i reached the shore half dead and afterward i was beaten and bought and sold i went through great trials in those days what can you tell me about tirant said plaerdemavida where did he die by the virgin mary said the prisoner he is very much alive he's right here he's the commander and he's using all his might to conquer this land he also told her that lord agramunt was wounded and then she asked him what became of plaerdemavida that maiden you're asking about said the prisoner it's believed that she died in the sea and our captain has grieved deeply over her when she heard the news she ordered all the prisoners to flee hearing that tirant was alive and so near she also wanted very much to escape but considering how tirant had conquered so much of the barbary coast and thinking of the victories that were told about the christian captain she was very happy for she had known nothing about him and believed that he had drowned in the sea she fell to her knees raised her clasped hands to heaven and gave thanks and praise to god our lord for the great success he had given to tirant and to the new christianity for he was making war on the enemies of jesus christ so bravely she became very hopeful that soon she would be out of captivity and all the suffering she had gone through up to then seemed to be nothing to her the thought that she would see tirant consoled her that much on the day her mistress had to go and talk to the captains she disguised herself so well that no one would recognize her when the lady was before the captain she was accompanied by fifty maidens but tirant would not listen to her and he sent her to his cousin lord agramunt and if he had replied badly to the ambassadors he gave an even worse reply to the lady hopeless they went back crying and lamenting loudly all that night men as well as women did not cease their wailing and sighing in the morning plaerdemavida told her mistress and the honorable men of the city that if they would give her liberty to go out she would talk to the captain and would tell him such things that he would do anything she wished they agreed that she should go because they had lost all hope and had only that one day left that day plaerdemavida dressed as a moor and painted her eyes so that she would not be recognized she took thirty well dressed maidens with her at noon they left the city and went to the camp and there they saw tirant at the door of his tent when he saw them coming he sent word that they should go to lord agramunt and that he could do nothing since he had turned all his power over to him plaerdemavida answered tell the captain that he should not refuse to see us and even less to speak to us because if that captain did such a thing he would be cruel and unjust since he is a knight and we are maidens in accordance with the order of chivalry he must aid us and give us his advice and his support chapter v for three years following the disappearance of prince richard a bent old woman lived in the heart of london within a stone's throw of the king's palace in a small back room she lived high up in the attic of an old building and with her was a little boy who never went abroad alone nor by day and upon his left breast was a strange mark which resembled a lily when the bent old woman was safely in her attic room with bolted door behind her she was wont to straighten up and discard her dingy mantle for more comfortable and becoming doublet and hose for years she worked assiduously with the little boy's education there were three subjects in her curriculum french swordsmanship and hatred of all things english especially the reigning house of england the old woman had had made a tiny foil and had commenced teaching the little boy the art of fence when he was but three years old you will be the greatest swordsman in the world when you are twenty my son she was wont to say and then you shall go out and kill many englishmen your name shall be hated and cursed the length and breadth of england and when you finally stand with the halter about your neck aha then will i speak then shall they know the little boy did not understand it all he only knew that he was comfortable and had warm clothing and all he required to eat and that he would be a great man when he learned to fight with a real sword and had grown large enough to wield one he also knew that he hated englishmen but why he did not know way back in the uttermost recesses of his little childish head he seemed to remember a time when his life and surroundings had been very different when instead of this old woman there had been many people around him and a sweet faced woman had held him in her arms and kissed him before he was taken off to bed at night but he could not be sure maybe it was only a dream he remembered for he dreamed many strange and wonderful dreams when the little boy was about six years of age a strange man came to their attic home to visit the little old woman it was in the dusk of the evening but the old woman did not light the cresset and further she whispered to the little boy to remain in the shadows of a far corner of the bare chamber the stranger was old and bent and had a great beard which hid almost his entire face except for two piercing eyes a great nose and a bit of wrinkled forehead when he spoke he accompanied his words with many shrugs of his narrow shoulders and with waving of his arms and other strange and amusing gesticulations the child was fascinated here was the first amusement of his little starved life he listened intently to the conversation which was in french i have just the thing for madame the stranger was saying it be a noble and stately hall far from the beaten way it was built in the old days by harold the saxon but in later times death and poverty and the disfavor of the king have wrested it from his descendants a few years since henry granted it to that favorite of his henri de macy who pledged it to me for a sum he hath been unable to repay today it be my property and as it be far from paris you may have it for the mere song i have named it be a wondrous bargain madame and when i come upon it i shall find that i have bought a crumbling pile of ruined masonry unfit to house a family of foxes replied the old woman peevishly one tower hath fallen and the roof for half the length of one wing hath sagged and tumbled in explained the old frenchman but the three lower stories be intact and quite habitable it be much grander even now than the castles of many of england's noble barons and the price madame ah the price be so ridiculously low still the old woman hesitated come said the frenchman i have it deposit the money with isaac the jew thou knowest him and he shall hold it together with the deed for forty days which will give thee ample time to travel to derby and inspect thy purchase if thou be not entirely satisfied isaac the jew shall return thy money to thee and the deed to me but if at the end of forty days thou hast not made demand for thy money then shall isaac send the deed to thee and the money to me be not this an easy and fair way out of the difficulty the little old woman thought for a moment and at last conceded that it seemed quite a fair way to arrange the matter and thus it was accomplished several days later the little old woman called the child to her we start tonight upon a long journey to our new home thy face shall be wrapped in many rags for thou hast a most grievous toothache dost understand iii at supper that night holiday talk held undisputed sway mr pritchard spoke of scotland miss isaacs clamoured of mr judson displayed a proprietary interest in the norfolk broads i said hoopdriver when the question came to him why cycling of course never going to ride that dreadful machine of yours day after day said miss howe of the costume department i am said hoopdriver as calmly as possible pulling at the insufficient moustache going for a cycling tour along the south coast well all i hope mr hoopdriver is that get fine weather said miss howe and not come any nasty croppers and done forget some tinscher of arnica in yer bag said the junior apprentice in the very high collar he had witnessed one of the lessons at the top of putney hill you stow it said mr hoopdriver looking hard and threateningly at the junior apprentice and suddenly adding in a tone of bitter contempt jampot getting fairly safe upon it now he told miss howe at other times hoopdriver might have further resented the satirical efforts of the apprentice but his mind was too full of the projected tour to admit any petty delicacies of dignity he left the supper table early so that he might put in a good hour at the desperate gymnastics up the roehampton road before it would be time to come back for locking up when the gas was turned off for the night he was sitting on the edge of his bed rubbing arnica into his knee a new and very big place and studying a road map of the south of england briggs of the dresses who shared the room with him was sitting up in bed and trying to smoke in the dark briggs had never been on a cycle in his life but he felt inexperience and offered such advice as occurred to him have the machine thoroughly well oiled said briggs carry one or two lemons with you tear yourself to death the first day and sit upright never lose control of the machine and always sound the bell on every possible opportunity you mind those things and nothing very much happen to you hoopdriver you take my word he would lapse into silence for a minute save perhaps for a curse or so at his pipe and then break out with an entirely different set of tips avoid running over dogs hoopdriver whatever you do one of the worst things you can do to run over a dog never let the machine buckle there was a man killed only the other day through his wheel buckling scorch ride on the keep your own side of the road and if you see a tramline go round the corner at once and hurry off into the next county and always light up before dark you mind just a few little things like that hoopdriver and nothing much happen to you you take my word right you are said hoopdriver old man said briggs and there was silence for a space save for the succulent respiration of the pipe hoopdriver rode off into dreamland on his machine and was scarcely there before he was pitched back into the world of sense again somethingwhat was it never oil the steering fatal a voice that came from round a fitful glow of light was saying and clean the chain daily with you mind just a few little things like that lord love us said hoopdriver and pulled the bedclothes over his ears iv the riding forth of mr hoopdriver only those who toil six long days out of the seven and all the year round save for one brief glorious fortnight or ten days in the summer time know the exquisite sensations of the first holiday morning all the dreary uninteresting routine drops from you suddenly your chains fall about your feet all at once you are lord of yourself lord of every hour in the long vacant day you may go where you please call none sir or madame have a lappel free of pins doff your black morning coat and wear the colour of your heart and be a man you grudge sleep you grudge eating and drinking even their intrusion on those exquisite moments there will be no more rising before breakfast in casual old clothing to go dusting and getting ready in a cheerless shop no more imperious cries of forward hoopdriver no more hasty meals and weary attendance on fitful old women for ten blessed days the first morning is by far the most glorious for you hold your whole fortune in your hands thereafter every night comes a pang a spectre that will not be exorcised the premonition of the return the shadow of going back of being put in the cage again for another twelve months lies blacker and blacker across the sunlight but on the first morning of the ten the holiday has no past and ten days seems as good as infinity and it was fine full of a promise of glorious days a deep blue sky with dazzling piles of white cloud here and there as though celestial haymakers had been piling the swathes of last clouds into cocks for a coming cartage there were thrushes in the richmond road and a lark on putney heath the freshness of dew was in the air dew or the relics of an overnight shower glittered on the leaves and grass hoopdriver had breakfasted early by mrs complaisance he wheeled his machine up putney hill and his heart sang within him halfway up a black cat rushed home across the road and vanished under a gate all the big houses behind the variegated shrubs and trees had their blinds down still and he would not have changed places with a soul in any one of them for a hundred pounds to the reader at the very outset of the writer's literary career a friend long since dead gave him the subject of this study later on he found the same story in a collection published about the beginning of the present century to the best of his belief it is some stray fancy of the brain of hoffmann of berlin probably it appeared in some german almanac and was omitted in the published editions of his collected works the comedie humaine is sufficiently rich in original creations for the author to own to this innocent piece of plagiarism when like the worthy la fontaine he has told unwittingly and after his own fashion a tale already related by another this is not one of the hoaxes in vogue in the year when every author wrote his tale of horror for the amusement of young ladies when you have read the account of don juan's decorous parricide try to picture to yourself the part which would be played under very similar circumstances by honest folk who in this nineteenth century will take a man's money and undertake to pay him a life annuity on the faith of a chill or let a house to an ancient lady for the term of her natural life would they be for resuscitating their clients i should dearly like a connoisseur in consciences to consider how far there is a resemblance between a don juan and fathers who marry their children to great expectations does humanity which according to certain philosophers is making progress look on the art of waiting for dead men's shoes as a step in the right direction to this art we owe several honorable professions which open up ways of living on death there are people who rely entirely on an expected demise who brood over it crouching each morning upon a corpse that serves again for their pillow at night to this class belong bishops coadjutors cardinals supernumeraries tontiniers and the like add to the list many delicately scrupulous persons eager to buy landed property beyond their means who calculate with dry logic and in cold blood the probable duration of the life of a father or of a some old man or woman of eighty or ninety saying to themselves i shall be sure to come in for it in three years time and then a murderer is less loathsome to us than a spy the murderer may have acted on a sudden mad impulse he may be penitent and amend but a spy is always a spy night and day in bed at table as he walks abroad his vileness pervades every moment of his life then what must it be to live when every moment of your life is tainted with murder and have we not just admitted that a host of human creatures in our midst are led by our laws customs and usages to dwell without ceasing on a death there are men who put the weight of a coffin into their deliberations as they bargain for cashmere shawls for their wives as they go up the staircase of a theatre or think of going to the bouffons or of setting up a carriage who are murderers in thought when dear ones with the irresistible charm of innocence hold up childish foreheads to be kissed with a father hourly they meet the gaze of eyes that they would fain close for ever eyes that still open each morning to the light like belvidero's in this study god alone knows the number of those who are parricides in thought picture to yourself the state of mind of a man who must pay a life annuity to some old woman whom he scarcely knows both live in the country with a brook between them both sides are free to hate cordially without offending against the social conventions that require two brothers to wear a mask if the older will succeed to the entail and the other to the fortune of a younger son the whole civilization of europe turns upon the principle of hereditary succession as upon a pivot it would be madness to subvert the principle but could we not in an age that prides itself upon its mechanical inventions perfect this essential portion of the social machinery if the author has preserved the style of address to the reader before a work wherein he endeavors to represent all literary forms it is for the purpose of making a remark that applies to several of the studies and very specially to this every one of his compositions has been based upon ideas more or less novel which as it seemed to him needed literary expression he can claim priority for certain forms and for certain ideas which have since passed into the domain of literature and have there in some instances become common property so that the date of the first publication of each study cannot be a matter of indifference to those of his readers who would fain do him justice reading brings us unknown friends and what friend is like a reader we have friends in our own circle who read nothing of ours the author hopes to pay his debt by dedicating this work diis ignotis chapter x newman continued to see his friends the tristrams with a good deal of frequency though if you had listened to mrs account of the matter you would have supposed that they had been cynically repudiated for the sake of grander acquaintance we were all very well so long as we had no rivals we were better than nothing but now that you have become the fashion and have your pick every day of three invitations to dinner we are tossed into the corner i am sure it is very good of you to come and see us once a month i wonder you send us your cards in an envelope when you do pray have them with black edges it will be for the death of my last illusion it was in this incisive strain that mrs tristram moralized over neglect which was in reality a most exemplary constancy of course she was joking but there was always something ironical in her jokes as there was always something jocular in her gravity i know no better proof that i have treated you very well newman had said than the fact that you make so free with my character familiarity breeds contempt i have made myself too cheap if i had a little proper pride i would stay away a while and when you asked me to dinner say i was going to the princess but i have not any pride where my pleasure is concerned and to keep you in the humor to see me if you must see me only to call me bad names i will agree to anything you choose i will admit that i am the biggest snob in paris newman in fact had declined an invitation personally given by the princess borealska an inquiring polish lady to whom he had been presented on the ground that on that particular day he always dined at mrs and it was only a tenderly perverse theory of his hostess of the avenue that he was faithless to his early friendships she needed the theory to explain a certain moral irritation by which she was often visited though if this explanation was unsound a deeper analyst than i must give the right one having launched our hero upon the current which was bearing him so rapidly along she appeared but at its swiftness she had succeeded too well she had played her game too cleverly and she wished to mix up the cards newman had told her in due season that her friend was satisfactory the epithet was not romantic but mrs tristram had no difficulty in perceiving that in essentials the feeling which lay beneath it was indeed the mild expansive brevity with which it was uttered and a certain look at once appealing and inscrutable that issued from eyes as he leaned his head against the back of his chair seemed to her the most eloquent attestation of a mature sentiment that she had ever encountered newman was according to the french phrase only abounding in her own sense but his temperate raptures exerted a singular effect upon the ardor which she herself had so freely manifested a few months before she now seemed inclined to take a purely critical view of madame de cintré and wished to have it understood that she did not in the least answer for her being a compendium of all the virtues no woman was ever so good as that woman seems she said remember what shakespeare calls desdemona a supersubtle venetian madame de cintré is a supersubtle parisian she is a charming woman and she has five hundred merits but you had better keep that in mind was mrs tristram simply finding out that she was jealous of her dear friend on the other side of the seine and that in undertaking to provide newman with an ideal wife she had counted too much on her own disinterestedness we may be permitted to doubt it the inconsistent little lady of the avenue had an insuperable need of changing her place intellectually she had a lively imagination and she was capable at certain times of imagining the direct reverse of her most cherished beliefs with a vividness more intense than that of conviction she got tired of thinking aright but there was no serious harm in it as she got equally tired of thinking wrong in the midst of her mysterious perversities she had admirable flashes of justice one of these occurred when newman related to her that he had made a formal proposal to madame de cintré he repeated in a few words what he had said and in a great many what she had answered mrs tristram listened with extreme interest but after all said newman there is nothing to congratulate me upon it is not a triumph i beg your pardon said mrs tristram it is a great triumph it is a great triumph that she did not silence you at the first word and request you never to speak to her again i see that observed newman of course you heaven forbid you should when i told you to go on your own way and do what came into your head i had no idea you would go over the ground so fast i never dreamed you would offer yourself after five or six as yet what had you done to make her like you you had simply sat not very straight and stared at her but she does like you ii it is furthermore remarkable that though the two stories are distinct my own as it were and this other they equally began in a manner the first night of my acquaintance with frank saltram the night i came back from wimbledon so agitated with a new sense of life that in london for the very thrill of it i could only walk home walking and swinging my stick i overtook at buckingham gate george gravener and george story may be said to have begun with my making him as our paths lay together come home with me for a talk i duly remember let me parenthesise that it was still more that of another person and also that several years were to elapse before it was to extend to a second chapter i had much to say to him none the less about my visit to the mulvilles whom he more indifferently knew and i was at any rate so amusing that for long afterwards he never encountered me without asking for news of the old man of the sea i said mr saltram was old and it was to be seen that he was of an age to outweather george gravener i had at that time a lodging in ebury street and gravener was staying at his empty house in eaton square at cambridge five years before even in our devastating set his intellectual power had seemed to me almost awful some one had once asked me privately with blanched cheeks what it was then that after all such a mind as that left standing it leaves itself i could recollect devoutly replying i could smile at present for this remembrance since before we got to ebury street i was struck with the fact that save in the sense of being well set up on his legs george gravener had actually ceased to tower the universe he laid low had somehow bloomed again the usual eminences were visible i wondered whether he had lost his humour or only dreadful thought had never had any not even when i had fancied him most aristophanesque what was the need of appealing to laughter however i could enviously enquire where you might appeal so confidently to measurement mr queer figure his thick nose and hanging lip were fresh to me in the light of my old fine cold symmetry they presented mere success in amusing as the refuge of conscious ugliness already at hungry gravener looked as blank and parliamentary as if he were fifty and popular in my scrap of a residence he had a eye for its futile conveniences but never a joke i sounded frank saltram in his ears a circumstance i mention in order to note that even then i was surprised at his impatience of my enlivenment as he had never before heard of the personage it took indeed the form of impatience of the preposterous mulvilles his relation to whom like mine had had its origin in an early a childish intimacy with the young adelaide the fruit of multiplied ties in the previous generation when she married kent mulville who was older than gravener and i and much more amiable i gained a friend but gravener practically lost one we reacted in different ways from the form taken by what he called their deplorable social action the form the term was also his of nasty gush i may have held in my for intérieur that the good people at wimbledon were beautiful fools but when he sniffed at them i help taking the opposite line for i already felt that even should we happen to agree it would always be for reasons that differed it came home to me that he was admirably british as without so much as a sociable sneer at my bookbinder he turned away from the serried rows of my little french library of course never seen the fellow but clear enough a humbug clear enough is just what it i replied if it only were that ejaculation on my part must have been the beginning of what was to be later a long ache for final frivolous rest gravener was profound enough to remark after a moment that in the first place he be anything but a dissenter and when i answered that the very note of his fascination was his extraordinary speculative breadth my friend retorted that there was no cad like your cultivated cad and that i might depend upon discovering since i had had the levity not already to have enquired that my shining light proceeded a generation back from a methodist cheesemonger i confess i was struck with his insistence and i said after reflexion it may be i admit it may be but why on earth are you so sure asking the question mainly to lay him the trap of saying that it was because the poor man dress for dinner he took an instant to circumvent my trap and come blandly out the other side because the kent mulvilles have invented him an infallible hand for frauds all their geese are swans they were born to be duped they like it they cry for it they know anything from anything and they disgust one luckily perhaps with christian charity his vehemence was doubtless an accident but it might have been a strange foreknowledge i forget what protest i dropped it was at any rate something that led him to go on after a moment i only ask one thing perfectly simple is a man in a given case a real gentleman the persons elfride swancourt a young lady christopher swancourt a clergyman stephen smith an architect henry knight a reviewer and essayist charlotte troyton a rich widow gertrude jethway a poor widow spenser hugo luxellian a peer lady luxellian his wife mary and kate two little girls william worm a dazed factotum john smith a jane smith his wife martin cannister a sexton unity a other servants masons labourers grooms nondescripts etc etc the scene mostly on the outskirts of lower wessex chapter i a fair vestal throned in the west elfride swancourt was a girl whose emotions lay very near the surface their nature more precisely and as modified by the creeping hours of time was known only to those who watched the circumstances of her history personally she was the combination of very interesting particulars whose rarity however lay in the combination itself rather than in the individual elements combined as a matter of fact you did not see the form and substance of her features when conversing with her and this charming power of preventing a material study of her lineaments by an interlocutor originated not in the cloaking effect of a manner for her manner was childish and scarcely formed but in the attractive crudeness of the remarks themselves she had lived all her life in retirement the monstrari gigito of idle men had not flattered her and at the age of nineteen or twenty she was no further on in social consciousness than an urban young lady of fifteen one point in her however you did notice that was her eyes in them was seen a sublimation of all of her it was not necessary to look further there she lived these eyes were blue blue as autumn distance blue as the blue we see between the retreating mouldings of hills and woody slopes on a sunny september morning a misty and shady blue that had no beginning or surface and was looked into rather than at as to her presence it was not powerful it was weak some women can make their personality pervade the atmosphere of a whole banqueting hall was no more pervasive than that of a kitten elfride had as her own the thoughtfulness which appears in the face of the madonna della sedia without its rapture the warmth and spirit of the type of feature most common to the beauties mortal and immortal of rubens without their insistent fleshiness the characteristic expression of the female faces of correggio that of the yearning human thoughts that lie too deep for tears was hers sometimes but seldom under ordinary conditions the point in elfride life at which a deeper current may be said to have permanently set in was one winter afternoon when she found herself standing in the character of hostess face to face with a man she had never seen before moreover looking at him with a curiosity and interest that she had never yet bestowed on a mortal on this particular day her father the vicar of a parish on the outskirts of lower wessex and a widower was suffering from an attack of gout after finishing her household supervisions elfride became restless and several times left the room ascended the staircase and knocked at her come in was always answered in a hearty voice from the inside papa she said on one occasion to the fine handsome man of forty who puffing and fizzing like a bursting bottle lay on the bed wrapped in a and every now and then enunciating in spite of himself about one letter of some word or words that were almost oaths papa will you not come downstairs this evening she spoke distinctly he was rather deaf afraid not very much afraid i shall not elfride i bear even a handkerchief upon this deuced toe of mine much less a stocking or slipper there tis again no i get up till then i hope this london man come for i know what i should do papa well it would be awkward certainly i should hardly think he would come why because the wind blows so wind what ideas you have elfride who ever heard of wind stopping a man from doing his business the idea of this toe of mine coming on so suddenly if he should come you must send him up to me i suppose and then give him some food and put him to bed in some way dear me what a nuisance all this is must he have dinner too heavy for a tired man at the end of a tedious journey tea then not substantial enough high tea then there is cold fowl some pasties and things of that kind yes high tea must i pour out his tea papa of course you are the mistress of the house what sit there all the time with a stranger just as if i knew him and not anybody to introduce us nonsense child about introducing you know better than that a practical professional man tired and hungry who has been travelling ever since daylight this morning will hardly be inclined to talk and air courtesies he wants food and shelter and you must see that he has it simply because i am suddenly laid up and cannot there is nothing so dreadful in that i hope you get all kinds of stuff into your head from reading so many of those novels and fanny brandeis took a long breath the trouble with the infants wear department is that it doesn't understand women there are millions of babies born every year an incredible number of them are mail order babies i mean by that they are born to tired immigrant women to women in mills and factories to women on farms to women in remote villages they're the type who use the mail order method i've learned this one thing about that sort of woman she may not want that baby but either before or after it's born she'll starve and save and go without proper clothing and even beg and steal to give it clothes clothes with lace on them with ribbon on them sheer white things i don't know why that's true but it is well we're not reaching them our goods are unattractive they're packed and shipped unattractively why all this department needs is a little psychology and some lace that doesn't look as if it had been chopped out with an ax it's the little silly intimate things that will reach these women no not silly either quite understandable she wants fine things for her baby just as the mother does the thing we'll have to do is to give her models at pewter prices it can't be done said slosson now wait a minute slosson fenger put in smoothly miss brandeis has given us a very fair general statement we'll have some facts are you prepared to give us an actual working plan yes at least it sounds practical to me and if it does to you and to mr slosson humph snorted that gentleman in expression of defiance unbelief and a determination not to be impressed it acted as a goad to fanny she leaned forward in her chair and talked straight at the big potent force that sat regarding her in silent attention i still say that we can copy the models in materials because in almost every case it isn't the material that makes the expensive model it's the line the cut the little trick that gives it style we can get that we've been giving them stuff that might have been made by prison labor for all the distinction it had then i think we ought to make a feature of the sanitary methods used in our infants department every article intended for a baby's use should be wrapped or boxed as it lies in the bin or on the shelf and those bins ought to be glassed we would advertise that and it would advertise itself our visitors would talk about it this department hasn't been getting a square deal in the catalogue not enough space it ought to have not only more catalogue space but a catalogue all its own the baby book full of pictures good ones illustrations that will make every mother think her baby will look like that baby once it is wearing our no chubby babies and dimply and the feature of that catalogue ought to be not separate garments but complete outfits outfits boxed ready for shipping and ranging in price all the way from dollars to it can't be done yelled slosson outfits it can be done i've figured it out down to a packet of assorted size safety pins we'll call it our emergency outfit thirty pieces and while we're about it every outfit over five dollars ought to be packed in a pink or a pale blue pasteboard box the outfits trimmed in pink pink boxes the outfits trimmed in blue blue boxes in eight cases out of ten their letters will tell us whether it's a pink or blue baby and when they get our package and take out that pink or blue box they'll be as pleased as if we'd made them a present it's the personal note personal slop growled slosson it isn't business it's sentimental slush sentimental yes agreed fanny pleasantly but then we're running the only sentimental department in this business and we ought to be doing it at the rate of a million and a quarter a year if you think these last suggestions sentimental i'm afraid the next one let's have it miss brandeis fenger encouraged her quietly it's she flashed a mischievous smile at slosson it's a mother's guide and helper and adviser a woman who'll answer questions give advice some one they'll write to with a picture in their minds of a large comfortable person in gray you know we get hundreds of letters asking whether they ought to order flannel bands or the kind that sort of thing and who's been answering them some girl in the mailing department who doesn't know a flannel band from a bootee when she sees it we could call our woman something pleasant and everydayish like emily brand easy to remember and until we can find her i'll answer those letters myself they're important to us as well as to the woman who writes them and now there's the matter of obstetrical outfits three grades packed ready for shipment practical simple and complete our drug section has the separate articles but we ought to oh lord groaned slosson and slumped disgustedly in his seat chapter xiii moloch the barbarians had no need of a circumvallation on the side of africa for it was theirs but to facilitate the approach to the walls the entrenchments bordering the ditch were thrown down matho next divided the army into great semicircles so as to encompass carthage the better the hoplites of the mercenaries were placed in the first rank and behind them the slingers and horsemen quite at the back were the baggage chariots and horses and the engines bristled in front of this throng at a distance of three hundred paces from the towers amid the infinite variety of their nomenclature which changed several times in the course of the centuries these machines might be reduced to two systems some acted like slings and the rest like bows the first which were the catapults was composed of a square frame with two vertical uprights and a horizontal bar in its anterior portion was a cylinder furnished with cables which held back a great beam bearing a spoon for the reception of projectiles its base was caught in a skein of twisted thread and when the ropes were let go it sprang up and struck against the bar which checking it with a shock multiplied its power the second presented a more complicated mechanism a had its centre fixed on a little pillar and from this point of junction there branched off at right angles a short of channel two caps containing twists of stood at the extremities of the two small beams were fastened to them to hold the extremities of a rope which was brought to the bottom of the channel upon a tablet of bronze this metal plate was released by a spring and sliding in grooves impelled the arrows the catapults were likewise called onagers after the wild asses which fling up stones with their feet and the ballistas scorpions on account of a hook which stood upon the tablet and being lowered by a blow of the fist released the spring their construction required learned calculations the wood selected had to be of the hardest substance and their gearing all of brass they were stretched with levers capstans or tympanums the direction of the shooting was changed by means of strong pivots they were moved forward on cylinders and the most considerable of them which were brought piece by piece were set up in front of the enemy spendius arranged three great catapults opposite the three principle angles he placed a ram before every gate a ballista before every tower while carroballistas were to move about in the rear but it was necessary to protect them against the fire thrown by the besieged and first of all to fill up the trench which separated them from the walls they pushed forward galleries formed of hurdles of green reeds and oaken semicircles like enormous shields gliding on three wheels the workers were sheltered in little huts covered with raw hides and stuffed with wrack the catapults and ballistas were protected by rope curtains which had been steeped in vinegar to render them incombustible the women and children went to procure stones on the strand and gathered earth with their hands and brought it to the soldiers the carthaginians also made preparations hamilcar had speedily reassured them by declaring that there was enough water left in the cisterns for one hundred and days this assertion together with his presence and above all that of the zaïmph among them gave them good hopes carthage recovered from its dejection those who were not of chanaanitish origin were carried away by the passion of the rest the slaves were armed the arsenals were emptied and every citizen had his own post and his own employment twelve hundred of the fugitives had survived and the suffet made them all captains and carpenters armourers blacksmiths and goldsmiths were intrusted with the engines the carthaginians had kept a few in spite of the conditions of the peace with rome these were repaired they understood such work the two northern and eastern sides being protected by the sea and the gulf remained inaccessible on the wall fronting the barbarians they collected vases filled with sulphur and vats filled with oil and built furnaces stones were heaped up on the platforms of the towers and the houses bordering immediately on the rampart were crammed with sand in order to strengthen it and increase its thickness the barbarians grew angry at the sight of these preparations they wished to fight at once the weights which they put into the catapults were so extravagantly heavy that the beams broke and the attack was delayed at last on the thirteenth day of the month of schabar at sunrise a great blow was heard at the gate of khamon soldiers were pulling at ropes arranged at the base of a gigantic beam which was suspended horizontally by chains hanging from a framework and which terminated in a head of pure brass it had been swathed in it was bound at intervals with iron bracelets it was thrice as thick as a body one hundred and twenty cubits long and under the crowd of naked arms pushing it forward and drawing it back it moved to and fro with a regular oscillation chapter viii the roof spaces as the fans in the circular aperture of the inner room rotated and permitted glimpses of the night dim sounds drifted in thereby and graham standing underneath wrestling darkly with the unknown powers that imprisoned him and which he had now deliberately challenged was startled by the sound of a voice he peered up and saw in the intervals of the rotation dark and dim the face and shoulders of a man regarding him when a dark hand was extended the swift fan struck it swung round and beat on with a little brownish patch on the edge of its thin blade and something began to fall therefrom upon the floor dripping silently graham looked down and there were spots of blood at his feet he looked up again in a strange excitement the figure had gone he remained motionless his every sense intent upon the flickering patch of darkness for outside it was high night he became aware of some faint remote dark specks floating lightly through the outer air they came down towards him fitfully eddyingly and passed aside out of the uprush from the fan a gleam of light flickered the specks flashed white and then the darkness came again warmed and lit as he was he perceived that it was snowing within a few feet of him graham walked across the room and came back to the ventilator again he saw the head of a man pass near there was a sound of whispering then a smart blow on some metallic substance effort voices and the vans stopped a gust of snowflakes whirled into the room and vanished before they touched the floor be afraid said a voice graham stood under the fan who are you he whispered for a moment there was nothing but a swaying of the fan and then the head of a man was thrust cautiously into the opening his face appeared nearly inverted to graham his dark hair was wet with dissolving flakes of snow upon it his arm went up into the darkness holding something unseen he had a youthful face and bright eyes and the veins of his forehead were swollen he seemed to be exerting himself to maintain his position for several seconds neither he nor graham spoke you were the sleeper said the stranger at last yes said graham what do you want with me i come from ostrog sire ostrog the man in the ventilator twisted his head round so that his profile was towards graham he appeared to be listening suddenly there was a hasty exclamation and the intruder sprang back just in time to escape the sweep of the released fan and when graham peered up there was nothing visible but the slowly falling snow it was perhaps a quarter of an hour before anything returned to the ventilator but at last came the same metallic interference again the fans stopped and the face reappeared graham had remained all this time in the same place alert and tremulously excited who are you what do you want he said we want to speak to you sire said the intruder we want i hold the thing we have been trying to find a way to you these three days is it rescue whispered graham escape yes sire if you will you are my party the party of the sleeper yes sire what am i to do said graham there was a struggle the arm appeared and his hand was bleeding his knees came into view over the edge of the funnel stand away from me he said and he dropped rather heavily on his hands and one shoulder at feet the released ventilator whirled noisily the stranger rolled over sprang up nimbly and stood panting hand to a bruised shoulder and with his bright eyes on graham you are indeed the sleeper he said i saw you asleep when it was the law that anyone might see you i am the man who was in the trance said graham they have imprisoned me here i have been here since i awoke at least three days the intruder seemed about to speak heard something glanced swiftly at the door and suddenly left graham and ran towards it shouting quick incoherent words a bright wedge of steel flashed in his hand and he began tap tap a quick succession of blows upon the hinges mind cried a voice oh the voice came from above graham glanced up saw the soles of two feet ducked was struck on the shoulder by one of them and a heavy weight bore him to the earth he fell on his knees and forward and the weight went over his head he knelt up and saw a second man from above seated before him i did not see you sire panted the man he rose and assisted graham to arise are you hurt sire he panted a succession of heavy blows on the ventilator began something fell close to face and a shivering edge of white metal danced fell over and lay flat upon the floor what is this cried graham confused and looking at the ventilator who are you what are you going to do remember i understand nothing chapter vi red kerry chief inspector kerry of the criminal investigation department stood before the empty grate of his cheerless office in new scotland yard one hand thrust into the pocket of his blue reefer jacket and the other twirling a malacca cane which was heavily and which must have excited the envy of every beholding it chief inspector kerry wore a very bowler hat having two ventilation holes conspicuously placed immediately above the band he wore this hat tilted forward and to the right red kerry wholly merited his sobriquet for the man was as red as fire his hair which he wore cropped close as a pugilist's was brilliantly red and so was his short wiry aggressive moustache his complexion was red and from beneath his straight red eyebrows he surveyed the world with a pair of unblinking intolerant eyes he never smoked in public as his taste inclined towards irish twist and a short clay pipe but he was addicted to the use of and as he chewed and he chewed incessantly he revealed a perfect row of large white and positively teeth high cheek bones and prominent maxillary muscles enhanced the truculence indicated by his chin but next to this truculence which was the first and most alarming trait to intrude itself upon the observer's attention the outstanding characteristic of chief inspector kerry was his compact neatness of no more than medium height but with shoulders like an acrobat he had slim straight legs and the feet of a dancing master his attire from the collar down to the neat black brogues was spotless his reefer jacket fitted him faultlessly but his trousers were cut so unfashionably narrow that the protuberant thigh muscles and the line of a highly developed calf could quite easily be discerned the hand twirling the cane was small but also muscular freckled and covered with light down red kerry was built on the lines of a whippet but carried the equipment of an irish terrier the telephone bell rang inspector kerry moved his square shoulders in a manner oddly suggestive of a wrestler laid the malacca cane on the mantleshelf and crossed to the table taking up the telephone yes he said and his voice was and imperious he listened for a moment very good sir he replaced the receiver took up a wet oilskin overall from the back of a chair and the cane from the mantleshelf then rolling from one corner of his mouth into the other he snapped off the electric light and walked from the room along the corridor he went with a lithe silent step moving from the hips and swinging his shoulders before a door marked private he paused from his waistcoat pocket he took a little silver convex mirror and surveyed himself critically therein he adjusted his neat tie replaced the mirror knocked at the door and entered the room of the assistant commissioner this important official was a man constructed on huge principles a man of military bearing having tired eyes and a bewildered manner he conveyed the impression that the collection of documents books telephones and other paraphernalia bestrewing his table had reduced him to a state of stupor he looked up wearily and met the fierce gaze of the chief inspector with a glance almost apologetic ah chief inspector kerry he said with vague surprise yes i told you to come really i ought to have been at home hours ago it's most unfortunate i have to do the work of three men this is your department is it not chief inspector he handed kerry a slip of paper at which the chief inspector stared fiercely murder rapped kerry sir lucien pyne yes sir i am still on duty his speech in moments of interest must have suggested to one overhearing him from an adjoining room for instance the operation of a telegraphic instrument he gave to every syllable the value of a rap and certain words he terminated with an audible snap of his teeth ah murmured the assistant commissioner yes divisional inspector somebody i cannot read the name has detained all the parties but you had better report at vine street it appears to be a big case he sighed wearily very good sir with your permission i will glance at sir lucien's pedigree certainly certainly said the assistant commissioner waving one large hand in the direction of a bookshelf kerry crossed the room laid his oilskin and cane upon a chair and from the shelf where it reposed took a squat volume the assistant commissioner hand pressed to brow began to study a document which lay before him here we are said kerry sotto voce pyne sir lucien st aubyn fourth baronet son of general sir christian pyne h'm born malta oriel college first in classics h'm blue india burma contested wigan attached british legation h'm he returned the book to its place took up his overall and cane and very good sir he said i will proceed to vine street certainly certainly murmured the assistant commissioner glancing up absently good night good night sir oh chief inspector kerry turned his hand on the sir i er what was i going to say oh yes the social importance of the murdered man raises the case from the er you follow me public interest will become acute no doubt i have therefore selected you for your well known discretion i met sir lucien once very sad good night the runs the coracle as i had ample reason to know before i was done with her was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight both buoyant and clever in a seaway but she was the most craft to manage do as you pleased she always made more leeway than anything else and turning round and round was the manoeuvre she was best at even ben gunn himself has admitted that she was queer to handle till you knew her way certainly i did not know her way she turned in every direction but the one i was bound to go the most part of the time we were broadside on and i am very sure i never should have made the ship at all but for the tide by good fortune paddle as i pleased the tide was still sweeping me down and there lay the hispaniola right in the fairway hardly to be missed first she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than darkness then her spars and hull began to take shape and the next moment as it seemed for the farther i went the brisker grew the current of the ebb i was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold the hawser was as taut as a bowstring and the current so strong she pulled upon her anchor all round the hull in the blackness the rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream one cut with my and the hispaniola would go humming down the tide so far so good but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut hawser suddenly cut is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse ten to one if i were so foolhardy as to cut the hispaniola from her anchor i and the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water this brought me to a full stop and if fortune had not again particularly favoured me i should have had to abandon my design but the light airs which had begun blowing from the and south had hauled round after nightfall into the just while i was meditating a puff came caught the hispaniola and forced her up into the current and to my great joy i felt the hawser slacken in my grasp and the hand by which i held it dip for a second under water with that i made my mind up took out my gully opened it with my teeth and cut one strand after another till the vessel swung only by two then i lay quiet waiting to sever these last when the strain should be once more lightened by a breath of wind all this time i had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin but to say truth my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts that i had scarcely given ear now however when i had nothing else to do i began to pay more heed one i recognized for the coxswain's israel hands that had been flint's gunner in former days the other was of course my friend of the red both men were plainly the worse of drink and they were still drinking for even while i was listening one of them with a drunken cry opened the stern window and threw out something which i divined to be an empty bottle but they were not only tipsy it was plain that they were furiously angry oaths flew like hailstones and every now and then there came forth such an explosion as i thought was sure to end in blows but each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while until the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without result on shore i could see the glow of the great burning warmly through the trees someone was singing a dull old droning sailor's song with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer i had heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words but one man of her crew alive what put to sea with and i thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a company that had met such cruel losses in the morning but indeed from what i saw all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed on at last the breeze came the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the dark i felt the hawser slacken once more and with a good tough effort cut the last fibres through the breeze had but little action on the coracle and i was almost instantly swept against the bows of the hispaniola at the same time the schooner began to turn upon her heel spinning slowly end for end across the current i wrought like a fiend for i expected every moment to be swamped and since i found i could not push the coracle directly off i now shoved straight astern at length i was clear of my dangerous neighbour and just as i gave the last impulsion my hands came across a light cord that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks instantly i grasped it chapter once a day i descend to the base of the cliff and hunt and fill my stomach with water from a clear cold spring i have three gourds which i fill with water and take back to my cave against the long nights i have fashioned a spear and a bow and arrow that i may conserve my ammunition which is running low my clothes are worn to shreds tomorrow i shall discard them for which i have tanned and sewn into a garment strong and warm it is cold up here i have a fire burning and i sit bent over it while i write but i am safe here no other living creature ventures to the chill summit of the barrier cliffs i am safe and i am alone with my sorrows and my remembered joys but without hope it is said that hope springs eternal in the human breast but there is none in mine i am about done presently i shall fold these pages and push them into my thermos bottle i shall cork it and screw the cap tight and then i shall hurl it as far out into the sea as my strength will permit the wind is the tide is running out perhaps it will be carried into one of those numerous which sweep perpetually from pole to pole and from continent to continent to be deposited at last upon some inhabited shore if fate is kind and this does happen then for god's sake come and get me it was a week ago that i wrote the preceding paragraph which i thought would end the written record of my life upon caprona i had paused to put a new point on my quill and stir the crude ink which i made by crushing a black variety of berry and mixing it with water before attaching my signature when faintly from the valley far below came an unmistakable sound which brought me to my feet trembling with excitement to peer eagerly downward from my dizzy ledge how full of meaning that sound was to me you may guess when i tell you that it was the report of a firearm for a moment my gaze traversed the landscape beneath until it was caught and held by four figures near the base of the cliff a human figure held at bay by three hyaenodons those ferocious and wild dogs of the eocene a fourth beast lay dead or dying near by i couldn't be sure looking down from above as i was but yet i trembled like a leaf in the intuitive belief that it was lys and my judgment served to confirm my wild desire for whoever it was carried only a pistol and thus had lys been armed the first wave of sudden joy which surged through me was in the face of the conviction that the one who fought below was already doomed luck and only luck it must have been which had permitted that first shot to lay low one of the savage creatures for even such a heavy weapon as my pistol is entirely inadequate against even the lesser carnivora of caspak in a moment the three would charge a futile shot would but tend more greatly to enrage the one it chanced to hit and then the three would drag down the little human figure and tear it to pieces and maybe it was lys my heart stood still at the thought but mind and muscle responded to the quick decision i was forced to make there was but a single hope a single chance and i took it i raised my rifle to my shoulder and took careful aim it was a long shot a dangerous shot for unless one is accustomed to it shooting from a considerable altitude is most deceptive work there is though something about marksmanship which is quite beyond all scientific laws upon no other theory can i explain my marksmanship of that moment three times my rifle spoke three quick short syllables of death i did not take conscious aim and yet at each report a beast crumpled in its tracks from my ledge to the base of the cliff is a matter of several thousand feet of dangerous climbing yet i venture to say that the first ape from whose loins my line has descended never could have equaled the speed with which i literally dropped down the face of that rugged escarpment the last two hundred feet is over a steep incline of loose rubble to the valley bottom and i had just reached the top of this when there arose to my ears an agonized cry bowen bowen quick my love quick i had been too much occupied with the dangers of the descent to glance down toward the valley but that cry which told me that it was indeed lys and that she was again in danger brought my eyes quickly upon her in time to see a hairy burly brute seize her and start off at a run toward the wood from rock to rock chamoislike i leaped downward toward the valley in pursuit of lys and her hideous abductor chapter ii jake dunlap we had powerful good luck because we got a chance in a from away north which was bound for one of them bayous or rivers away down louisiana way and so we could go all the way down the upper mississippi and all the way down the lower mississippi to that farm in arkansaw without having to change steamboats at st louis not so very much short of a thousand miles at one pull a pretty lonesome boat there warn't but few passengers and all old folks that set around wide apart dozing and was very quiet we was four days getting out of the upper river because we got aground so much but it warn't dull couldn't be for boys that was traveling of course from the very start me and tom allowed that there was somebody sick in the stateroom next to ourn because the meals was always toted in there by the waiters by and by we asked about it tom did and the waiter said it was a man but he didn't look sick well but ain't he sick i don't know maybe he is but pears to me he's just letting on what makes you think that because if he was sick he would pull his clothes off some time or other don't you reckon he would well this one don't at least he don't ever pull off his boots anyway the mischief he don't not even when he goes to bed no it was always nuts for tom sawyer a mystery was if you'd lay out a mystery and a pie before me and him you wouldn't have to say take your choice it was a thing that would regulate itself because in my nature i have always run to pie whilst in his nature he has always run to mystery people are made different and it is the best way tom says to the waiter what's the man's name phillips where'd he come aboard i think he got aboard at elexandria up on the iowa line what do you reckon he's i hain't any notion i never thought of it i says to myself here's another one that runs to pie anything peculiar about him the way he acts or talks no nothing except he seems so scary and keeps his doors locked night and day both and when you knock he won't let you in till he opens the door a crack and sees who it is by jimminy it's int'resting i'd like to get a look at him say the next time you're going in there don't you reckon you could spread the door and no indeedy he's always behind it he would block that game tom studied over it and then he says looky here you lend me your apern and let me take him his breakfast in the morning i'll give you a quarter the boy was plenty willing enough if the head steward wouldn't mind tom says that's all right he reckoned he could fix it with the head steward and he done it he fixed it so as we could both go in with aperns on and toting vittles he didn't sleep much he was in such a sweat to get in there and find out the mystery about phillips and moreover he done a lot of guessing about it all night which warn't no use for if you are going to find out the facts of a thing what's the sense in guessing out what ain't the facts and wasting ammunition i didn't lose no sleep i wouldn't give a dern to know what's the matter of phillips i says to myself well in the morning we put on the aperns and got a couple of trays of truck and tom he knocked on the door the man opened it a crack and then he let us in and shut it quick by jackson when we got a sight of him we most dropped the trays and tom says why jubiter dunlap where'd you come from well the man was astonished of course and first off he looked like he didn't know whether to be scared or glad or both or which but finally he settled down to being glad and then his color come back though at first his face had turned pretty white so we got to talking together while he et his breakfast and he says but i aint jubiter dunlap i'd just as soon tell you who i am though if you'll swear to keep mum for i ain't no phillips either tom says we'll keep mum but there ain't any need to tell who you are if you ain't jubiter dunlap why because if you ain't him you're t'other twin jake you're the spit'n image of jubiter well i'm jake but looky here how do you come to know us dunlaps tom told about the adventures we'd had down there at his uncle silas's last summer and when he see that there warn't anything about his folks or him either for that matter that we didn't know he opened out and talked perfectly free and candid he never made any bones about his own case said he'd been a hard lot was a hard lot yet and reckoned he'd be a hard lot plumb to the end he said of course it was a dangerous life and he give a kind of gasp and set his head like a person that's listening we didn't say anything and so it was very still for a second or so and there warn't no sounds but the screaking of the woodwork and the of the machinery down below chapter iii what had next brought him back clearly though after how long was mrs muldoon's voice coming to him from quite near from so near that he seemed presently to see her as kneeling on the ground before him while he lay looking up at her himself not wholly on the ground but and upheld conscious yes of tenderness of support and more particularly of a head pillowed in extraordinary softness and faintly refreshing fragrance he considered he wondered his wit but half at his service then another face intervened bending more directly over him and he finally knew that alice staverton had made her lap an ample and perfect cushion to him and that she had to this end seated herself on the lowest degree of the staircase the rest of his long person remaining stretched on his old slabs they were cold these marble squares of his youth but he somehow was not in this rich return of consciousness the most wonderful hour little by little that he had ever known leaving him as it did so gratefully so abysmally passive and yet as with a treasure of intelligence waiting all round him for quiet appropriation dissolved he might call it in the air of the place and producing the golden glow of a late autumn afternoon he had come back yes come back from further away than any man but himself had ever travelled but it was strange how with this sense what he had come back to seemed really the great thing and as if his prodigious journey had been all for the sake of it slowly but surely his consciousness grew his vision of his state thus completing itself he had been miraculously carried back lifted and carefully borne as from where he had been picked up the uttermost end of an interminable grey passage even with this he was suffered to rest and what had now brought him to knowledge was the break in the long mild motion it had brought him to knowledge to knowledge yes this was the beauty of his state which came to resemble more and more that of a man who has gone to sleep on some news of a great inheritance and then after dreaming it away after profaning it with matters strange to it has waked up again to serenity of certitude and has only to lie and watch it grow this was the drift of his patience that he had only to let it shine on him he must moreover with intermissions still have been lifted and borne since why and how else should he have known himself later on with the afternoon glow intenser no longer at the foot of his stairs situated as these now seemed at that dark other end of his tunnel but on a deep of his high saloon over which had been spread a mantle of soft stuff lined with grey fur that was familiar to his eyes and that one of his hands kept fondly feeling as for its pledge of truth mrs muldoon's face had gone but the other the second he had recognised hung over him in a way that showed how he was still propped and pillowed he took it all in and the more he took it the more it seemed to suffice he was as much at peace as if he had had food and drink it was the two women who had found him on mrs muldoon's having plied at her usual hour her and on her having above all arrived while miss staverton still lingered near the house she had been turning away all anxiety from worrying the vain her calculation having been of the hour of the good woman's visit but the latter blessedly had come up while she was still there and they had entered together he had then lain beyond the vestibule very much as he was lying now quite that is as he appeared to have fallen but all so wondrously without bruise or gash only in a depth of stupor what he most took in however at present with the steadier clearance was that alice staverton had for a long unspeakable moment not doubted he was dead it must have been that i was he made it out as she held him yes i can only have died you brought me literally to life only he wondered his eyes rising to her only in the name of all the benedictions how it took her but an instant to bend her face and kiss him and something in the manner of it and in the way her hands clasped and locked his head while he felt the cool charity and virtue of her lips something in all this beatitude somehow answered everything and now i keep you she said oh keep me keep me he pleaded while her face still hung over him in response to which it dropped again and stayed close clingingly close it was the seal of their situation of which he tasted the impress for a long blissful moment in silence but he came back yet how did you know i was uneasy you were to have come you remember and you had sent no word yes i remember i was to have gone to you at one it caught on to their old life and relation which were so near and so far i was still out there in my strange darkness where was it what was it i must have stayed there so long he could but wonder at the depth and the duration of his swoon l frank baum santa claus lives in the laughing valley where stands the big rambling castle in which his toys are manufactured his workmen selected from the ryls knooks pixies and fairies live with him and every one is as busy as can be from one year's end to another it is called the laughing valley because everything there is happy and gay the brook chuckles to itself as it leaps rollicking between its green banks the wind whistles merrily in the trees the sunbeams dance lightly over the soft grass and the violets and wild flowers look smilingly up from their green nests to laugh one needs to be happy to be happy one needs to be content and throughout the laughing valley of santa claus contentment reigns supreme on one side is the mighty forest of burzee at the other side stands the huge mountain that contains the caves of the daemons and between them the valley lies smiling and peaceful one would thing that our good old santa claus who devotes his days to making children happy would have no enemies on all the earth and as a matter of fact for a long period of time he encountered nothing but love wherever he might go but the daemons who live in the mountain caves grew to hate santa claus very much and all for the simple reason that he made children happy the caves of the daemons are five in number a broad pathway leads up to the first cave which is a finely arched cavern at the foot of the mountain the entrance being beautifully carved and decorated in it resides the daemon of selfishness back of this is another cavern inhabited by the daemon of envy the cave of the daemon of hatred is next in order and through this one passes to the home of the daemon of malice situated in a dark and fearful cave in the very heart of the mountain i do not know what lies beyond this some say there are terrible pitfalls leading to death and destruction and this may very well be true however from each one of the four caves mentioned there is a small narrow tunnel leading to the fifth cave a cozy little room occupied by the daemon of repentance and as the rocky floors of these passages are well worn by the track of passing feet i judge that many wanderers in the caves of the daemons have escaped through the tunnels to the abode of the daemon of repentance who is said to be a pleasant sort of fellow who gladly opens for one a little door admitting you into fresh air and sunshine again well these daemons of the caves thinking they had great cause to dislike old santa claus held a meeting one day to discuss the matter i'm really getting lonesome said the daemon of selfishness for santa claus distributes so many pretty christmas gifts to all the children that they become happy and generous through his example and keep away from my cave i'm having the same trouble rejoined the daemon of envy the little ones seem quite content with santa claus and there are few indeed that i can coax to become envious and that makes it bad for me declared the daemon of hatred for if no children pass through the caves of selfishness and envy none can get to my cavern or to mine added the daemon of malice for my part said the daemon of repentance it is easily seen that if children do not visit your caves they have no need to visit mine so that i am quite as neglected as you are and all because of this person they call santa claus exclaimed the daemon of envy he is simply ruining our business and something must be done at once to this they readily agreed but what to do was another and more difficult matter to settle they knew that santa claus worked all through the year at his castle in the laughing valley preparing the gifts he was to distribute on christmas eve and at first they resolved to try to tempt him into their caves that they might lead him on to the terrible pitfalls that ended in destruction so the very next day while santa claus was busily at work surrounded by his little band of assistants the daemon of selfishness came to him and said these toys are wonderfully bright and pretty why do you not keep them for yourself it's a pity to give them to those noisy boys and fretful girls who break and destroy them so quickly nonsense cried the old graybeard his bright eyes twinkling merrily as he turned toward the tempting daemon the boys and girls are never so noisy and fretful after receiving my presents and if i can make them happy for one day in the year i am quite content so the daemon went back to the others who awaited him in their caves and said i have failed for santa claus is not at all selfish the following day the daemon of envy visited santa claus said he the toy shops are full of playthings quite as pretty as those you are making what a shame it is that they should interfere with your business they make toys by machinery much quicker than you can make them by hand and they sell them for money while you get nothing at all for your work xiv wolf on the anniversary of the night mescal disappeared the mysterious voice which had called to hare so often and so strangely again pierced his slumber and brought him bolt upright in his bed shuddering and listening the dark room was as quiet as a tomb he fell back into his blankets trembling with emotion sleep did not close his eyes again that night he lay in a fever waiting for the dawn and when the gray gloom lightened he knew what he must do after breakfast he sought august naab may i go across the river he asked the old man looked up from his carpenter's task and fastened his glance on hare mescal yes i saw it long ago he shook his head and spread his great hands there's no use for me to say what the desert is if you ever come back you'll bring her yes you may go it's a man's deed god keep you hare spoke to no other person he filled one with grain another with meat bread and dried fruits strapped a leather back of silvermane's saddle and set out toward the river at the he removed silvermane's equipments and placed them in the boat at that moment a long howl as of a dog baying the moon startled him from his musings and his eyes sought the up and down and then the opposite side an animal which at first he took to be a gray was running along the of the landing pretty white for a wolf he muttered might be a navajo dog the beast sat down on his haunches and lifting a lean head sent up a doleful howl then he began trotting along the bar every few paces stepping to the edge of the water presently he spied hare and he began to bark furiously it's a dog all right wants to get across said hare where have i seen him suddenly he sprang to his feet almost upsetting the boat he's like mescal's wolf he looked closer his heart beginning to thump and then he yelled wolf hyer hyer the dog leaped straight up in the air and coming down began to dash back and forth along the sand with piercing yelps it's wolf mescal must be near cried hare a veil obscured his sight and every vein was like a hot cord wolf wolf i'm coming with trembling hands he tied silvermane's bridle to the stern seat of the boat and pushed off in his eagerness he rowed too hard dragging silvermane's nose under water and he had to check himself time and again he turned to call to the dog at length the bow grated on the sand and silvermane emerged with a splash and a snort wolf old fellow cried hare where's mescal wolf where is she he threw his arms around the dog wolf whined licked hare's face and breaking away ran up the sandy trail and back again but he barked no more he waited to see if hare was following all right wolf coming never had hare saddled so speedily nor mounted so quickly he sent silvermane into the trail close behind the dog up on the rocky bench and then under the bulging wall wolf reached the level between the canyon and echo cliffs and then started straight west toward the painted desert he trotted a few rods and turned to see if the man was coming doubt fear uncertainty ceased for hare with the first blast of dust scented air in his face he knew wolf was leading him to mescal he knew that the cry he had heard in his dream was hers that the old mysterious promise of the desert had at last begun its fulfilment he gave one sharp exultant answer to that call the horizon lay before him and the treeless plains the slopes the sandy stretches the massed blocks of black mesas all seemed to welcome him his soul sang within him for mescal was there far away she must be a mere grain of sand in all that world of drifting sands perhaps ill perhaps hurt but alive waiting for him calling for him crying out with a voice that no distance could silence he did not see the sharp peaks as pitiless barriers nor the mesas and domes as death nor the sands as foes to plant and beast and man that painted wonderland had sheltered mescal for a year he had loved it for its color its change its secrecy he loved it now because it had not been a grave for mescal but a home therefore he laughed at the deceiving yellow distances in the foreground of glistening mesas at the deceiving purple distances of the horizon the wind blew a song in his ears the dry desert odors were fragrance in his nostrils the sand tasted sweet between his teeth and the quivering veiling the desert in transparent haze framed beautiful pictures for his eyes wolf kept to the fore for some thirty paces and though he had ceased to stop he still looked back to see if the horse and man were following hare had noted the dog occasionally in the first hours of travel but he had given his eyes mostly to the broken line of sky and desert in the west to the receding contour of echo cliffs to the spread and break of the desert near at hand here and there life showed itself in a gaunt coyote sneaking into the cactus or a horned toad huddling down in the dust or a lizard sunning himself upon a stone it was only when his excited fancy had cooled that hare came to look closely at wolf but for the dog's color he could not have been distinguished from a real wolf his head and ears and tail drooped and he was lame in his right front paw preface the public are here presented with the last literary attempt of an author whose fame has been uncommonly extensive and whose talents have probably been most admired by the persons by whom talents are estimated with the greatest accuracy and discrimination there are few to whom her writings could in any case have given pleasure that would have wished that this fragment should have been suppressed because it is a fragment there is a sentiment very dear to minds of taste and imagination that finds a melancholy delight in contemplating these unfinished productions of genius these sketches of what if they had been filled up in a manner adequate to the conception would perhaps have given a new impulse to the manners of a world the purpose and structure of the following work had long formed a favourite subject of meditation with its author and she judged them capable of producing an important effect the composition had been in progress for a period of twelve months she was anxious to do justice to her conception and recommenced and revised the manuscript several different times so much of it as is here given to the public she was far from considering as finished and in a letter to a friend directly written on this subject she says i am perfectly aware that some of the incidents ought to be transposed and heightened by more harmonious shading and i wished in some degree to avail myself of criticism before i began to adjust my events into a story the outline of which i had sketched in my mind the only friends to whom the author communicated her manuscript were mr dyson the translator of the sorcerer and the present editor and it was impossible for the most inexperienced author to display a stronger desire of profiting by the censures and sentiments that might be suggested a more copious extract of this letter is subjoined to the preface the part communicated consisted of the first fourteen chapters in revising these sheets for the press it was necessary for the editor in some places to connect the more finished parts with the pages of an older copy and a line or two in addition sometimes appeared requisite for that purpose wherever such a liberty has been taken the additional phrases will be found inclosed in brackets it being the most earnest desire to intrude nothing of himself into the work but to give to the public the words as well as ideas of the real author what follows in the ensuing pages is not a preface regularly drawn out by the author but merely hints for a preface which though never filled up in the manner the writer intended appeared to be worth preserving w godwin preface the wrongs of woman like the wrongs of the oppressed part of mankind may be deemed necessary by their oppressors but surely there are a few who will dare to advance before the improvement of the age and grant that my sketches are not the abortion of a distempered fancy or the strong delineations of a wounded heart in writing this novel i have rather endeavoured to pourtray passions than manners in many instances i could have made the incidents more dramatic would i have sacrificed my main object the desire of exhibiting the misery and oppression peculiar to women that arise out of the partial laws and customs of society in the invention of the story this view restrained my fancy and the history ought rather to be considered as of woman than of an individual the sentiments i have embodied in many works of this species the hero is allowed to be mortal and to become wise and virtuous as well as happy by a train of events and circumstances the heroines on the contrary are to be born immaculate and to act like goddesses of wisdom just come forth highly finished minervas from the head of jove the following is an extract of a letter from the author to a friend towhom she communicated her manuscript for my part i cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound to such a man as i have described for life obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment love in which the imagination mingles its bewitching colouring must be fostered by delicacy i should despise or rather call her an ordinary woman who could endure such a husband as i have sketched these appear to me matrimonial despotism of heart and conduct to be the peculiar wrongs of woman because they degrade the mind what are termed great misfortunes may more forcibly impress the mind of common readers they have more of what may justly be termed but it is the delineation of finer sensations which in my opinion constitutes the merit of our best novels this is what i have in view and to show the wrongs of different classes of women equally oppressive though from the difference of education necessarily various chapter abodes of horror have frequently been described and castles filled with spectres and chimeras conjured up by the magic spell of genius to harrow the soul and absorb the wondering mind but formed of such stuff as dreams are made of what were they to the mansion of despair in one corner of which maria sat endeavouring to recall her scattered thoughts published september the neighbourhood of bloomsbury square towards four of a november afternoon is not so crowded as to secure to the stranger of appearance anything out of the common immunity from observation boy screaming at the top of his voice that she was his honey stopped suddenly stepped backwards on to the toes of a voluble young lady wheeling a perambulator and remained deaf apparently to the somewhat personal remarks of the voluble young lady not until he had reached the next corner and then more as a soliloquy than as information to the street did boy recover sufficient interest in his own affairs to remark that he was her bee the voluble young lady herself following some yards behind forgot her wrongs in contemplation of the back there was this that was peculiar about the back that instead of being flat it presented a decided curve it a ump and it look like kervitcher of the spine observed the voluble young lady to herself blimy if i believe taking ome is washing up his back the constable at the corner trying to seem busy doing nothing noticed the approach with gathering interest an odd sort of a walk of yours young man thought the constable you take care you fall down and tumble over yourself thought he was a young man murmured the constable the stranger having passed him he had a young face right enough the daylight was fading the stranger finding it impossible to read the name of the street upon the corner house turned back why tis a young man the constable told himself a mere boy i beg your pardon said the stranger but would you mind telling me my way to bloomsbury square this is bloomsbury square explained the constable leastways round the corner is what number might you be wanting the stranger took from the ticket pocket of his tightly buttoned overcoat a piece of paper unfolded it and read it out mrs pennycherry number round to the left instructed him the constable fourth house been recommended there by by a friend replied the stranger thank you very much ah muttered the constable to himself guess you be calling him that by the end of the week young funny added the constable gazing after the retreating figure of the stranger seen plenty of the other sex as looked young behind and old in front this cove looks young in front and old behind guess look old all round if he stops long at mother stingy old cat constables whose beat included bloomsbury square had their reasons for not liking mrs pennycherry indeed it might have been difficult to discover any human being with reasons for liking that lady maybe the keeping of boarding houses in the neighbourhood of bloomsbury does not tend to develop the virtues of generosity and amiability meanwhile the stranger proceeding upon his way had rung the bell of number mrs pennycherry peeping from the area and catching a glimpse above the railings of a handsome if somewhat effeminate masculine face hastened to readjust her cap before the while directing mary jane to show the stranger should he prove a problematical boarder into the and to light the gas and stop gossiping and you take it upon yourself to answer questions say be up in a minute were mrs further instructions and mind you hide your hands as much as you can what are you grinning at demanded mrs pennycherry a couple of minutes later of the dingy mary jane grinning explained the meek mary jane was only smiling to myself what at dunno admitted mary jane but still she went on smiling he like then demanded mrs pennycherry e the usual sort was mary opinion thank god for that ejaculated mrs pennycherry piously says been recommended by a friend by whom by a friend e say no name mrs pennycherry pondered not the funny sort is he not that sort at all mary jane was sure of it mrs pennycherry ascended the stairs still pondering as she entered the room the stranger rose and bowed nothing could have been simpler than the bow yet there came with it to mrs pennycherry a rush of old sensations long forgotten for one brief moment mrs pennycherry saw herself an amiable lady widow of a solicitor a visitor had called to see her it was but a momentary fancy the next instant reality reasserted itself mrs pennycherry a keeper existing precariously upon a daily round of petty meannesses was prepared for contest with a possible new boarder who fortunately looked an inexperienced young gentleman someone has recommended me to you began mrs pennycherry may i ask who but the stranger waved the question aside as immaterial you might not remember him he smiled he thought that i should do well to pass the few months i am given that i have to be in london here you can take me in mrs pennycherry thought that she would be able to take the stranger in a room to sleep in explained the stranger any room will do with food and drink sufficient for a man is all that i require i they had four hours in new york between trains the one thing babbitt wished to see was the pennsylvania hotel which had been built since his last visit he stared up at it muttering hundred rooms and hundred baths that's got everything in the world beat lord their turnover must be well suppose price of rooms is four to eight dollars a day and i suppose maybe some ten and four times six times hundred well anyway with restaurants and everything say summers between eight and fifteen thousand a day every day i never thought i'd see a thing like that some town of course the average fellow in zenith has got more individual initiative than the fourflushers here but i got to hand it to new york yes sir town you're all right some ways well old paulski i guess we've seen everything that's worth while how'll we kill the rest of the time movie but paul desired to see a liner always wanted to go to europe and by thunder i will too some day before i past out he sighed from a rough wharf on the north river they stared at the stern of the aquitania and her stacks and wireless antenna lifted above the which shut her in by golly babbitt droned wouldn't be so bad to go over to the old country and take a squint at all these ruins and the place where shakespeare was born and think of being able to order a drink whenever you wanted one just range up to a bar and holler out loud gimme a cocktail and darn the police not bad at all what juh like to see over there paulibus paul did not answer babbitt turned paul was standing with clenched fists head drooping staring at the liner as in terror his thin body seen against the planks of the wharf was childishly meager again what would you hit for on the other side paul scowling at the steamer his breast heaving paul whispered oh my god while babbitt watched him anxiously he snapped come on let's get out of this and hastened down the wharf not looking back that's funny considered babbitt the boy didn't care for seeing the ocean boats after all i thought he'd be interested in em ii though he exulted and made sage speculations about locomotive as their train climbed the maine and from the summit he looked down the shining way among the pines though he remarked well by golly when he discovered that the station at katadumcook the end of the line was an aged babbitt's moment of impassioned release came when they sat on a tiny wharf on lake sunasquam awaiting the launch from the hotel a raft had floated down the lake between the logs and the shore the water was transparent flashing with minnows a guide in black felt hat with in the band and flannel shirt of a peculiarly daring blue sat on a log and whittled and was silent a dog a good country dog black and woolly gray a dog rich in leisure and in meditation scratched and grunted and slept the thick sunlight was lavish on the bright water on the rim of balsam boughs the silver birches and tropic ferns and across the lake it burned on the sturdy shoulders of the mountains over everything was a holy peace silent they loafed on the edge of the wharf swinging their legs above the water the immense tenderness of the place sank into babbitt and he murmured i'd just like to sit here the rest of my life and whittle and sit and never hear a typewriter or stan graff fussing in the phone or rone and ted scrapping just sit gosh he patted paul's shoulder how does it strike you old snoozer oh it's darn good georgie there's something sort of eternal about it for once babbitt understood him iii their launch rounded the bend at the head of the lake under a mountain slope they saw the little central of their hotel and the crescent of squat log cottages which served as bedrooms they landed and endured the critical examination of the habitues who had been at the hotel for a whole week in their cottage with its high stone fireplace they hastened as babbitt expressed it to get into some regular they came out paul in an old gray suit and soft white shirt babbitt in khaki shirt and vast and flapping khaki trousers it was excessively new khaki his rimless spectacles belonged to a city office and his face was not tanned but a city pink he made a discordant noise in the place but with infinite satisfaction he slapped his legs and crowed say this is getting back home eh they stood on the wharf before the hotel he winked at paul and drew from his back pocket a plug of a vulgarism forbidden in the babbitt home he took a chew beaming and wagging his head as he tugged at it um um maybe i haven't been hungry for a wad of have some they looked at each other in a grin of understanding paul took the plug gnawed at it they stood quiet their jaws working they solemnly spat one after the other into the placid water they stretched voluptuously with lifted arms and arched backs from beyond the mountains came the shuffling sound of a train a

styled the palais cardinal a man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flames great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin candelabra rich with any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of the and the measured paces of the guards upon the have fancied that the shade of cardinal richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt it was alas the ghost of former greatness france enfeebled the authority of her sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great richelieu no longer in existence in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal that the people were possessed of arms the rebellion of the high ki the bold speech of nerle's made the two damsels laugh at the same time and their sweet laughter sounded like rippling strains of harmonious music but the two frowned angrily and the two ki looked at the boy in surprise as if wondering at his temerity who are these strangers asked the pretty high ki speaking together as all the twins of twi did and why are they not mates but only half of each other these questions your supreme highnesses said the pair of we are unable to answer perhaps then the strangers can answer themselves said the little maids smiling first upon the and then upon the prisoners prince marvel bowed i am from the great outside world said he and my name is prince marvel until now i have never seen people that live in pairs and speak in unison and act in the same way and think the same thoughts my world is much bigger than your world and in it every person is proud to think and act for himself you say i am only a half but that is not so i am perfect without a counterpart my friend nerle is perfect without a counterpart and it is yourselves who are halved for in the land of twi no person is complete or perfect without its other half and it seems to take two of you to make one man or one maid the sweet faces of the twin high ki grew thoughtful at this speech and they said indeed it may be you are right but it is our custom in twi to do everything double and to live double then turning to the ki they asked why have you brought these strangers here to ask your supreme highnesses to permit them to return again to the world from whence they came answered the ki both of them regarding their supreme rulers earnestly but here the spoke up quickly in their mild voices saying that is not our idea your highnesses we the of twi think it best the strangers should be put to death and we pray your supreme highnesses to favor our wish the two little maids looked from the ki to the and frowned and pouted their rosy lips in evident perplexity but nerle whispered to prince marvel it's all up with us i know very well why her royal doublets always favors the it's because they are young and handsome while the ki are old and ugly both of her will condemn us to death you see if she don't this seemed somewhat mixed but nerle was in earnest and prince marvel who had not forgotten his fairy lore began to weave a silent spell over the head of the nearest twin high ki but just as it was completed and before he had time to work the spell on the other twin the grew impatient and exclaimed we beg your highnesses not to keep us waiting let us have your decision at once and the twin maidens raised their fair heads and replied but the reply was of such a nature that both the old ki and both the young staggered backward in amazement for one of the twin high ki said they shall die and the other twin high ki said at the same instant they shall not die had twin thunderbolts fallen through the twin roofs of the twin palaces and struck the twin ki and the twin upon their twin heads it would have created no more stupendous a sensation than did this remark never before had any two halves of a twin of the land of twi thought differently or spoken differently indeed it startled the two maidens themselves as much as it did their hearers for each one turned her head toward the other and for the first time in her life looked into the other's face this act was fully as strange as their speech and a sudden horrible thought came into the startled heads of the twin ki and the twin the high ki of twi was no longer one but two and these two were thinking and acting each independent of the other it is no wonder the shock rendered them speechless for a time and they stood swaying their four bodies with their eight eyes bulging out like those of fishes and their four mouths wide open as if the two pairs had become one quartet the faces of the two maids flushed as they gazed upon each other how dare you contradict me asked one how dare you contradict me demanded the other and not only were these questions asked separately but the accent on the words was different and their twin minds seemed to get farther apart every moment i'm the high ki of twi said one you're not i'm the high ki retorted the other the strangers shall die snapped one they shall live cried the other my will is supreme it's not my will is supreme returned the other twin the bald heads of the ancient ki were bobbing in amazement first to one maid and then toward the other the blond hairs of the two were standing almost on end and their eyes stared straight before them as if stupefied with astonishment nerle was bellowing with rude laughter and holding his sides to keep from getting a stitch in them while prince marvel stood quietly attentive and smiling with genuine amusement for he alone understood what had happened to separate the twin high ki poseidon's wrath a family reunion would be nice i really don't get around as much as i used to the job you know duties responsibilities you humans you just don't understand how vexing it can be being a god why every day day in and day out i've got to have the sun rise no big chore but it's only one of many zeus shook his head the moon if i don't watch her goes wandering off messes up the tides terribly disconcerting to young lovers too he looked head cocked to the side at demo so what may i ask do you want here at olympus for a moment demo was nonplused sire i gathered you had sent for me i came not of my own volition perhaps some other has need of my services somebody is playing games and they are surely going to get themselves into a mess of trouble yes a mess of trouble zeus glanced around a thoughtful expression on his face a titter sounded from the inner hallway zeus glanced at demo to see whether he had noted the sound demo was silent best to leave all surmises alone after all he thought who am i to criticize the dalliances of zeus zeus smiled anyway you are here so let's get you started on another exciting excursion by the way you've really done remarkably well and i am proud of you here let me give you a slight token he thought a moment smiled once more and waved his hands nonchalantly in the air the medal was large and shiny as zeus slipped the supporting chain over demo's head demo took the medal in his hands read the legend thereon although the words were difficult to read in an inverted position he managed to decipher them for ungodly support to the gods zeus kissed him on one cheek then the other i'm never sure the order in which i'm supposed to do that never mind if i got it wrong we'll merely change the ritual he glanced rather anxiously toward the hallway young man rather quickly now i want you to drop in on poseidon lovely fellow you'll like him eh don't ever discuss fishing with him he has a dread of the subject i was fishing one day and he nibbled at the bait and anyway a subject not to be discussed where was i zeus glared at demo as though the boy had stolen his train of thought take this bag with you and give it into his hands and his only he'll know what to do by the way do you own a bathing suit zeus olympus and all else seemed to be fading away demo seemed to hear faintly zeus scolding now you know you aren't supposed to play with my powers you just leave that young man alone my dear i'm such an ogre when i'm jealous he landed with a splash zeus aim was plainly off almost always he had landed in his home the forest but this the middle of a stream of course he slipped under the water propelled himself upward glancing quickly around at the height of his watery leap a shudder went through him no river this neither shores nor the green forest nor the high mountains of home water only water deep blue water extending as far as eye could see blue and salty surely he had landed in the ocean zeus oh zeus i do think you may have erred only slightly of course zeus who dares call on zeus when he swims in my domain how come you here earthling where is your ship do you not fear my watchdogs the great sharks that guard my kingdom and why call you on zeus poseidon rules these waves i my name is demo i was merely doing an errand for zeus and through some mischance i landed in these waters perhaps you can direct me to the nearest shore mischance eh well zeus is putting on the years odd but he may be losing his grip oughta spend more time at the seashore relaxing yes indeed the voice seemed to emanate from a which floated rather nonchalantly at arms length away the nearest shore of course you earthlings i would invite you down for a meal but you lack the necessary organs to join me toward the setting sun a small island i'll race you demo looked to the west water only water is it well very far no no just a good swim away ah forgive me it could be a bit strenuous for you i'll take care of it though the whistled loudly popped up above the water to peruse its surface here he comes demo followed the gaze he wished he hadn't the shark was approaching at alarming speed its fin split the water's smooth surface drawing ever closer demo's eyes widened hey that's a shark yes yes indeed actually merely a minnow as sharks grow actually he was the only one in the area so i flagged him down oh taxi right this way the shark circled slowly at times rising to the surface its cold eyes regarding demo with hungry interest chapter anne went home to think over all that she had heard in one point her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him he stood as opposed to captain wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness and the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief he might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed pity for him was all over but this was the only point of relief in every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward she saw more to distrust and to apprehend she was concerned for the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing how to avert any one of them she was most thankful for her own knowledge of him she had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like mrs smith but here was a reward indeed springing from it mrs smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done could the knowledge have been extended through her family but this was a vain idea she must talk to lady russell tell her consult with her and having done her best wait the event with as much composure as possible and after all her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself she found on reaching home that she had as she intended escaped seeing mr elliot that he had called and paid them a long morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herself and felt safe when she heard that he was coming again in the evening i had not the smallest intention of asking him said elizabeth with affected carelessness but he gave so many hints so mrs clay says at least indeed i do say it i never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation poor man i was really in pain for him for your sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty oh cried elizabeth i have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints however when i found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit an opportunity of bringing him and sir walter together they appear to so much advantage in company with each other each behaving so pleasantly mr elliot looking up with so much respect quite delightful cried mrs clay not daring however to turn her eyes towards anne exactly like father and son dear miss elliot may i not say father and son oh i lay no embargo on any body's words if you will have such ideas but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men my dear miss elliot exclaimed mrs clay lifting her hands and eyes and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence well my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him i did invite him you know i sent him away with smiles when i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park for the whole day i had compassion on him anne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shew such pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate the sight of mr elliot and yet she could assume a most obliging placid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have done otherwise to anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her she had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere but now she saw insincerity in everything his attentive deference to her father contrasted with his former language was odious and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness or the sound of his artificial good sentiments she meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side it was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship and to retrace as quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along she was accordingly more guarded and more cool than she had been the night before he wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation but the charm was broken he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin's vanity he found at least that it was not to be done now by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the claims of the others he little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable the odds and ends of doctor walker's sensational escape that night to south america of the recovery of over a million dollars in cash and securities in the safe from the chimney room the papers have kept the public well informed of my share in discovering the secret chamber they have been singularly silent the inner history has never been told mr jamieson got all kinds of credit and some of it he deserved but if jack bailey as alex had not traced halsey and insisted on the disinterring of paul armstrong's casket if he had not suspected the truth from the start where would the detective have been when halsey learned the truth he insisted on going the next morning weak as he was to louise and by night she was at sunnyside under gertrude's particular care while her mother had gone to barbara fitzhugh's what halsey said to mrs armstrong i never knew but that he was considerate and chivalrous i feel confident it was halsey's way always with women he and louise had no conversation together until that night gertrude and alex i mean jack had gone for a walk although it was nine o'clock and anybody but a pair of young geese would have known that dew was falling and that it is next to impossible to get rid of a summer cold at half after nine growing weary of my own company i went downstairs to find the young people at the door of the i paused gertrude and jack had returned and were there sitting together on a divan with only one lamp lighted they did not see or hear me and i beat a hasty retreat to the library but here again i was driven back louise was sitting in a deep chair looking the happiest i had ever seen her with halsey on the arm of the chair holding her close it was no place for an elderly spinster i retired to my upstairs and got out eliza klinefelter's lavender slippers ah well the foster motherhood would soon have to be put away in camphor again the next day by degrees i got the whole story paul armstrong had a besetting evil the love of money common enough but he loved money not for what it would buy but for its own sake an examination of the books showed no irregularities in the past year since john had been cashier but before that in the time of anderson the old cashier who had died much strange juggling had been done with the records the railroad in new mexico had apparently drained the banker's private fortune and he determined to retrieve it by one stroke this was nothing less than the looting of the bank's securities turning them into money and making his escape but the law has long arms paul armstrong evidently studied the situation carefully just as the only good indian is a dead indian so the only safe defaulter is a dead defaulter he decided to die to all appearances and when the hue and cry subsided he would be able to enjoy his money almost anywhere he wished the first necessity was an accomplice the connivance of doctor walker was suggested by his love for louise the man was unscrupulous and with the girl as a bait paul armstrong soon had him fast the plan was apparently the acme of simplicity a small town in the west an attack of heart disease a body from a medical college shipped in a trunk to doctor walker by a colleague in san francisco and palmed off for the supposed dead banker what was simpler the woman nina carrington was the cog that slipped what she only suspected what she really knew we never learned she was a chambermaid in the hotel at c and it was evidently her intention to blackmail doctor walker his position at that time was uncomfortable to pay the woman to keep quiet would be confession he denied the whole thing and she went to halsey it was this that had taken halsey to the doctor the night he disappeared he accused the doctor of the deception and crossing the lawn had said something cruel to louise then furious at her apparent connivance he had started for the station doctor walker and paul armstrong the latter still lame where i had shot him hurried across to the embankment certain only of one thing halsey must not tell the detective what he suspected until the money had been removed from the they stepped into the road in front of the car to stop it and fate played into their hands the car struck the train and they had only to dispose of the unconscious figure in the road this they did as i have told for three days halsey lay in the box car tied hand and foot suffering tortures of thirst delirious at times and discovered by a tramp at johnsville only in time to save his life to go back to paul armstrong at the last moment his plans had been frustrated sunnyside with its hoard in the had been rented without his knowledge attempts to dislodge me having failed he was driven to breaking into his own house the ladder in the chute the burning of the stable and the entrance through the window all were in the course of a desperate attempt to get into the richard harding davis the old time journalist will tell you that the best reporter is the one who works his way up he holds that the only way to start is as a printer's devil or as an office boy to learn in time to set type to graduate from a compositor into a stenographer and as a stenographer take down speeches at public meetings and so finally grow into a real reporter with a fire badge on your left suspender and a speaking acquaintance with all the greatest men in the city not even excepting police captains that is the old time journalist's idea of it that is the way he was trained and that is why at the age of sixty he is still a reporter if you train up a youth in this way he will go into reporting with too full a knowledge of the newspaper business with no illusions concerning it and with no ignorant enthusiasms but with a keen and justifiable impression that he is not paid enough for what he does and he will only do what he is paid to do now you cannot pay a good reporter for what he does because he does not work for pay he works for his paper he gives his time his health his brains his sleeping hours and his eating hours and sometimes his life to get news for it he thinks the sun rises only that men may have light by which to read it but if he has been in a newspaper office from his youth up he finds out before he becomes a reporter that this is not so and loses his real value he should come right out of the university where he has been doing campus notes for the college weekly and be pitchforked out into city work without knowing whether the battery is at harlem or hunter's point and with the idea that he is a moulder of public opinion and that the power of the press is greater than the power of money and that the few lines he writes are of more value in the editor's eyes than is the column of advertising on the last page which they are not after three years it is sometimes longer sometimes not so long he finds out that he has given his nerves and his youth and his enthusiasm in exchange for a general fund of miscellaneous knowledge the opportunity of personal encounter with all the greatest and most remarkable men and events that have risen in those three years and a great fund of resource and patience he will find that he has crowded the experiences of the lifetime of the ordinary young business man doctor or lawyer or man about town into three short years that he has learned to think and to act quickly to be patient and unmoved when everyone else has lost his head actually or figuratively speaking to write as fast as another man can talk and to be able to talk with authority on matters of which other men do not venture even to think until they have read what he has written with a at his elbow on the night previous it is necessary for you to know this that you may understand what manner of man young albert gordon was young gordon had been a reporter just three years he had left yale when his last living relative died and had taken the morning train for new york where they had promised him reportorial work on one of the innumerable greatest new york dailies he arrived at the office at noon and was sent back over the same road on which he had just come to spuyten duyvil where a train had been wrecked and everybody of consequence to suburban new york killed one of the old reporters hurried him to the office again with his copy and after he had delivered that he was sent to the tombs to talk french to a man in murderers row who could not talk anything else but who had shown some international skill in the use of a jimmy and at eight he covered a in madison square garden and at eleven was sent over the brooklyn bridge in a cab to watch a fire and make guesses at the losses to the insurance companies he went to bed at one and dreamed of shattered locomotives human beings lying still with blankets over them rows of cells and banks of beautiful flowers nodding their heads to the tunes of the brass band in the gallery he decided when he awoke the next morning that he had entered upon a picturesque and exciting career and as one day followed another he became more and more convinced of it and more and more devoted to it he was twenty then and he was now and in that time had become a great reporter and had been to presidential conventions in chicago revolutions in hayti indian outbreaks on the plains and midnight meetings of moonlighters in tennessee and had seen what work earthquakes floods fire and fever could do in great cities and had contradicted the president and borrowed matches from burglars and now he thought he would like to rest and breathe a bit and not to work again unless as a war correspondent the only obstacle to his becoming a great war correspondent lay in the fact that there was no war and a war correspondent without a war is about as absurd an individual as a general without an army he read the papers every morning on the elevated trains for war clouds but though there were many war clouds they always drifted apart and peace smiled again this was very disappointing to young gordon and he became more and more keenly discouraged chapter ii i only six when wee brown elspeth was brought to me jean and angus were as fond of each other in their silent way as they were of me and they often went together with me when i was taken out for my walks i was kept in the open air a great deal and angus would walk by the side of my small shaggy shetland pony and lead him over rough or steep places sheltie the pony was meant for use when we wished to fare farther than a child could walk but i was trained to sturdy marching and climbing even from my babyhood because i so loved the moor we nearly always rambled there often we set out early in the morning and some simple food was carried so that we need not return to the castle until we chose i would ride sheltie and walk by turns until we found a place i liked then jean and angus would sit down among the heather sheltie would be secured and i would wander about and play in my own way i do not think it was in a strange way i think i must have played as almost any lonely little girl might have played i used to find a corner among the bushes and pretend it was my house and that i had little friends who came to play with me i only remember one thing which was not like the ordinary playing of children it was a habit i had of sitting quite still a long time and listening that was what i called it listening i was listening to hear if the life on the moor made any sound i could understand i felt as if it might if i were very still and listened long enough angus and jean and i were not afraid of rain and mist and change of weather if we had been we could have had little outdoor life we always carried plaids enough to keep us warm and dry so on this day i speak of we did not turn back when we found ourselves in the midst of a sudden mist we sat down in a sheltered place and waited knowing it would lift in time the sun had been shining when we set out angus and jean were content to sit and guard me while i amused myself they knew i would keep near them and run into no danger i was not an adventurous child i was in fact in a more than usually quiet mood that morning the quiet had come upon me when the mist had begun to creep about and inclose us i liked it i liked the sense of being shut in by the soft whiteness i had so often watched from my nursery window in the castle people might be walking about i said to angus when he lifted me from back we see them they might be walking nothing that would hurt ye bairnie he answered no they hurt me i said i had never been afraid that anything on the moor would hurt me i played very little that day the quiet and the mist held me still soon i sat down and began to listen after a while i knew that jean and angus were watching me but it did not disturb me they often watched me when they thought i did not know they were doing it i had sat listening for nearly half an hour when i heard the first muffled slow trampling of horses hoofs i knew what it was even before it drew near enough for me to be conscious of the other sounds the jingling of arms and chains and the creaking of leather one notices as troopers pass by armed and mounted men were coming toward me that was what the sounds meant but they seemed faint and distant though i knew they were really quite near jean and angus did not appear to hear them i knew that i only heard them because i had been listening out of the mist they rode a company of men wearing garments such as i had never seen before most of them were savage and uncouth and their clothes were disordered and stained as if with hard travel and fight i did not know or even ask myself why they did not frighten me but they did not suddenly i seemed to know that they were brave men and had been doing some brave hard thing here and there among them i caught sight of a broken and stained sword or a dirk with only a hilt left they were all pale but their wild faces were joyous and triumphant i saw it as they drew near the man who seemed their chieftain was a lean giant who was darker but under his darkness paler than the rest on his forehead was a queer scar he rode a black horse and before him he held close with his left arm a pretty little girl dressed in strange rich clothes the big hand was pressed against her breast as he held her but though it was a large hand it did not quite cover a stain on the embroideries of her dress her dress was brown and she had brown hair and soft brown eyes like a little the moment i saw her i loved her chapter xxiv on the morning of the duane rode into bradford in time to catch the early train his wounds did not seriously incapacitate him longstreth was with him and miss longstreth and ruth herbert would not be left behind they were all leaving fairdale for ever longstreth had turned over the whole of his property to morton who was to divide it as he and his comrades believed just duane had left fairdale with his party by night passed through sanderson in the early hours of dawn and reached bradford as he had planned that fateful morning found duane outwardly calm but inwardly he was in a tumult he wanted to rush to val verde would captain macnelly be there with his rangers as duane had planned for them to be memory of that tawny poggin returned with strange passion duane had borne hours and weeks and months of waiting had endured the long hours of the outlaw but now he had no patience the whistle of the train made him leap it was a fast train yet the ride seemed slow duane disliking to face longstreth and the passengers in the car changed his seat to one behind his prisoner they had seldom spoken longstreth sat with bowed head deep in thought the girls sat in a seat near by and were pale but composed occasionally the train halted briefly at a station the latter half of that ride duane had observed a running parallel with the railroad sometimes right alongside at others near or far away when the train was about twenty miles from val verde duane espied a dark group of horsemen trotting eastward his blood beat like a hammer at his temples the gang he thought he recognized the tawny poggin and felt a strange inward contraction he thought he recognized the blossom kane the giant boldt the panhandle smith and fletcher there was another man strange to him was that knell no it could not have been knell duane leaned over the seat and touched longstreth on the shoulder look he whispered cheseldine was stiff he had already seen the train flashed by the outlaw gang receded out of range of sight did you notice knell wasn't with them whispered duane duane did not speak to longstreth again till the train stopped at val verde they got off the car and the girls followed as naturally as ordinary travelers the station was a good deal larger than that at bradford and there was considerable action and bustle incident to the arrival of the train duane's sweeping gaze searched faces rested upon a man who seemed familiar this fellow's look too was that of one who knew duane but was waiting for a sign a cue then duane recognized him macnelly without mustache he appeared different younger when macnelly saw that duane intended to greet him to meet him he hurried forward a keen light flashed from his eyes he was glad eager yet suppressing himself and the glances he sent back and forth from duane to longstreth were questioning doubtful certainly longstreth did not look the part of an outlaw duane lord i'm glad to see you was the captain's greeting then at closer look into duane's face his warmth fled something he saw there checked his enthusiasm or at least its utterance macnelly shake hand with cheseldine said duane the ranger captain stood dumb motionless but he saw longstreth's instant action and awkwardly he reached for the outstretched hand any of your men down here queried duane sharply no they're come macnelly you walk with him we've ladies in the party i'll come behind with them they set off longstreth walked as if he were with friends on the way to dinner the girls were mute macnelly walked like a man in a trance there was not a word spoken in four blocks presently duane espied a stone building on a corner of the broad street there was a big sign rancher's bank there's the hotel said macnelly some of my men are there we've scattered around they crossed the street went through office and lobby and then duane asked macnelly to take them to a private room without a word the captain complied when they were all inside duane closed the door and drawing a deep breath as if of relief he faced them calmly miss longstreth you and miss ruth try to make yourselves comfortable now he said and don't be distressed then he turned to his captain macnelly this girl is the daughter of the man i've brought to you and this one is his niece then duane briefly related longstreth's story and though he did not spare the rustler chief he was generous when i went after longstreth concluded duane it was either to kill him or offer him freedom on conditions so i chose the latter for his daughter's sake he has already disposed of all his property i believe he'll live up to the conditions he's to leave texas never to return the name cheseldine has been a mystery and now it'll fade a few moments later duane followed macnelly to a large room like a hall and here were men reading and smoking duane knew them rangers for sake the library at tredowen was a room of irregular shape full of angles and recesses lined with bookcases it was in one of these standing motionless before a small marble statue of some forgotten greek poet that wingrave found his visitor she wore a plain serge traveling dress and the pallor of her face from which she had just lifted a voluminous veil matched almost in color the gleaming white marble upon which she was gazing but when she saw wingrave leaning upon his stick and regarding her with stern surprise strange lights seemed to flash in her eyes there was no longer any resemblance between the pallor of her cheeks and the pallor of the statue lady ruth wingrave said quietly i do not understand what has procured for me the pleasure of this unexpected visit she swayed a little towards him her head was thrown back all the silent passion of the inexpressible the hidden secondary forces of nature was blazing out of her eyes pleading with him in the broken music of her tone you do not understand she repeated ah no but can i make you understand will you listen to me for once as a human being will you remember that you are a man and i a woman pleading for a little mercy a little kindness wingrave moved a step further back permit me he said to offer you a chair she sank into it speechless for a moment wingrave stood over her leaning slightly against the corner of the bookcase i trust he said that you will explain what all this means if it is my help which you require her hands flashed out towards him a gesture almost of horror she begged you know that it is not that you know very well that it is not why do you torture me i can only ask you he said to explain she commenced talking quickly her sentences came in little gasps you wanted revenge not in the ordinary way you had brooded over it too long you understood too well once it was i who sought to revenge myself on you because you would not listen to me you hurt my pride everything that was evil in me rebelled is this necessary he interrupted coldly i have never reproached you you chose the path of safety for yourself many another woman in your place would doubtless have done the same thing what i desire to know is why you are here in cornwall what has happened to make this journey seem necessary to you listen she continued i want you to know how thoroughly you have succeeded before you came lumley and i were living together decently enough and as hundreds of others live with outside interests for our chief distraction you came a friend you were very subtle very skillful you never spoke a word of affection to me but you managed things so that people talked you encouraged lumley to speculate not in actual words perhaps but by suggestion then you lent me money lumley my husband let me borrow from you everyone knew that we were ruined everyone knew where the money came from that set us right so misery has been piled upon misery lumley has lost his self respect he is losing his ambition he is deteriorating every day i how can i do anything else but despise him he let me his wife come to your rooms to borrow money from you do you think i can ever forget that do you think that he can you know that the memory of it is dragging us apart must keep us apart always always wingrave leaned a little forward his hands were clasped upon the handle of his stick all that you tell me he remarked coldly might equally well have been said in london i do not wish to seem inhospitable but i am still waiting to know why you have taken an eight hours journey to recite a few fairly obvious truths your relations with your husband frankly do not interest me the deductions which society may have drawn concerning our friendship need scarcely trouble you under the circumstances then again the light was blazing in her eyes under the circumstances she repeated i know what you mean it is true that you have asked for nothing it is true that all this time you have never spoken a single word which all the world might not hear you have never even touched my fingers except as a matter of formality once i was the woman you loved and i well you know is this part of your scheme of torture to play with me as though we were marionettes you and i with sawdust in our veins dull lifeless puppets well it is finished your vengeance you may reap the harvest when you will publish my letters prove yourself an injured man take a whip in your hand if you like and i will never flinch but for sake remember that i am a woman i am willing to be your slave nurse you wait upon you follow you about what more can your vengeance need you have made me despise my husband you have made me hate my life with him you have forced me into a remembrance of what i have never really forgotten and oh wingrave she added opening her arms to him with a little sob if you send me away i think that i shall kill myself wingrave chapter ix tuppence enters domestic service when tommy set forth on the trail of the two men it took all to refrain from accompanying him however she contained herself as best she might consoled by the reflection that her reasoning had been justified by events the two men had undoubtedly come from the second floor flat and that one slender thread of the name rita had set the young adventurers once more upon the track of the abductors of jane finn the question was what to do next tuppence hated letting the grass grow under her feet tommy was amply employed and debarred from joining him in the chase the girl felt at a loose end she retraced her steps to the entrance hall of the mansions it was now tenanted by a small who was polishing brass fittings and whistling the latest air with a good deal of vigour and a reasonable amount of accuracy he glanced round at entry there was a certain amount of the gamin element in the girl at all events she invariably got on well with small boys a sympathetic bond seemed instantly to be formed she reflected that an ally in the camp so to speak was not to be despised well william she remarked cheerfully in the best approved style getting a good shine up the boy grinned responsively albert miss he corrected albert be it said tuppence she glanced mysteriously round the hall the effect was purposely a broad one in case albert should miss it she leaned towards the boy and dropped her voice i want a word with you albert albert ceased operations on the fittings and opened his mouth slightly look do you know what this is with a dramatic gesture she flung back the left side of her coat and exposed a small enamelled badge it was extremely unlikely that albert would have any knowledge of it indeed it would have been fatal for plans since the badge in question was the device of a local training corps originated by the archdeacon in the early days of the war its presence in coat was due to the fact that she had used it for pinning in some flowers a day or two before but tuppence had sharp eyes and had noted the corner of a threepenny detective novel protruding from pocket and the immediate enlargement of his eyes told her that her tactics were good and that the fish would rise to the bait american detective force she hissed albert fell for it lord he murmured ecstatically tuppence nodded at him with the air of one who has established a thorough understanding know who after she inquired genially albert still demanded breathlessly one of the flats tuppence nodded and jerked a thumb up the stairs no calls herself vandemeyer vandemeyer ha ha hand stole to his pocket a crook he queried eagerly a crook i should say so ready rita they call her in the states ready rita repeated albert deliriously oh it just like the pictures it was tuppence was a great frequenter of the cinema annie always said as how she was a bad lot continued the boy annie inquired tuppence idly leaving the time said to me mark my words albert i wonder if the police was to come after her one of these days just like that but a stunner to look at she some peach allowed tuppence carelessly finds it useful in her you bet has she been wearing any of the emeralds by the way emeralds the green stones they tuppence nodded what after her for you know old man rysdale albert shook his head peter b rysdale the oil king it seems sort of familiar to me the sparklers belonged to him finest collection of emeralds in the world worth a million dollars lumme came ecstatically from albert it sounds more like the pictures every minute tuppence smiled gratified at the success of her efforts we exactly proved it yet but after her and she produced a wink i guess she get away with the goods this time albert uttered another ejaculation indicative of delight mind you sonny not a word of this said tuppence suddenly i guess i to have put you wise but in the states we know a real smart lad when we see one not breathe a word protested albert eagerly there anything i could do a bit of shadowing maybe or such like tuppence affected to consider then shook her head not at the moment but bear you in mind son this about the girl you say is leaving annie regular turn up they ad as annie said servants is some one nowadays and to be treated accordingly and what with her passing the word round she find it so easy to get another she said tuppence thoughtfully i wonder an idea was dawning in her brain she thought a minute or two then tapped albert on the shoulder see here son my got busy how would it be if you mentioned that got a young cousin or a friend of yours had that might suit the place you get me iv he was a young man with an eager soul and his work in apple blossom court and places like it had torn him many ways religious conventions established through centuries of custom had not prepared him for life among the submerged he had struggled and been appalled he had wrestled in prayer and felt himself unanswered and in repentance of the feeling had scourged himself with thorns miss montaubyn returning from the hospital had filled him at first with horror and protest but who knows who knows he said to dart as they stood and talked together afterward faith as a little child that is literally hers and i was shocked by it and tried to destroy it until i suddenly saw what i was doing i was in my cloddish egotism trying to show her that she was irreverent because she could believe what in my soul i do not though i dare not admit so much even to myself she took from some strange passing visitor to her tortured bedside what was to her a revelation she heard it first as a child hears a story of magic when she came out of the hospital she told it as if it was one i i he bit his lips and moistened them argued with her and reproached her christ the merciful forgive me she sat in her squalid little room with her magic sometimes in the dark sometimes without fire and she clung to it and loved it and asked it to help her as a child asks its father for bread when she was answered and god forgive me again for doubting that the simple good that came to her was an answer when any small help came to her she was a radiant thing and without a shadow of doubt in her eyes told me of it as proof proof that she had been heard when things went wrong for a day and the fire was out again and the room dark she said i aven't kept near enough i aven't trusted true it will be gave me soon and when once at such a time i said to her we must learn to say thy will be done she smiled up at me like a happy baby and answered thy will be done on earth as it is in eaven lor there's no cold there nor no unger nor no cryin nor pain that's the way the will is done in eaven that's wot i arst for all day long for it to be done on earth as it is in eaven what could i say could i tell her that the will of the deity on the earth he created was only the will to do evil to give pain to crush the creature made in his own image what else do we mean when we say under all horror and agony that befalls it is god's will god's will be done base unbeliever though i am i could not speak the words oh she has something we have not her poor little misspent life has changed itself into a shining thing though it shines and glows only in this hideous place she herself does not know of its shining but drunken bet would stagger up to her room and ask to be told what she called her pantermine stories i have seen her there sitting listening listening with strange quiet on her and dull yearning in her sodden eyes so would other and worse women go to her and i who had struggled with them could see that she had reached some remote longing in their beings which i had never touched in time the seed would have stirred to life it is beginning to stir even now during the months since she came back to the court though they have laughed at her both men and women have begun to see her as a creature weirdly set apart most of them feel something like awe of her they half believe her prayers to be bewitchments but they want them on their side they have never wanted mine that i have known known she believes that her deity is in apple blossom court in the dire holes its people live in on the broken stairway in every nook and awful cranny of it a great glory we will not see only waiting to be called and to answer do i believe it do you do any of those anointed of us who preach each day so glibly god is everywhere who is the one who believes if there were such a man he would go about as moses did when he wist not that his face shone they had gone out together and were standing in the fog in the court the curate removed his hat and passed his handkerchief over his damp forehead his breath coming and going almost sobbingly his eyes staring straight before him into the yellowness of the haze who he said after a moment of singular silence who are you antony dart hesitated a few seconds and at the end of his pause he put his hand into his overcoat pocket if you will come upstairs with me to the room where the girl glad lives i will tell you he said but before we go i want to hand something over to you chapter iii wrecked on a desert island after this stop we made on to the southward continually for ten or twelve days living very sparingly on our provisions which began to abate very much and going no oftener to the shore than we were obliged to for fresh water my design in this was to make the river gambia or senegal that is to say anywhere about the cape de verde where i was in hopes to meet with some european ship and if i did not i knew not what course i had to take but to seek for the islands or perish there among the negroes i knew that all the ships from europe which sailed either to the coast of guinea or to brazil or to the east indies made this cape or those islands and in a word i put the whole of my fortune upon this single point either that i must meet with some ship or must perish when i had pursued this resolution about ten days longer as i have said i began to see that the land was inhabited and in two or three places as we sailed by we saw people stand upon the shore to look at us we could also perceive they were quite black and naked i was once inclined to have gone on shore to them but xury was my better counsellor and said to me no go no go however i hauled in nearer the shore that i might talk to them and i found they ran along the shore by me a good way i observed they had no weapons in their hand except one who had a long slender stick which xury said was a lance and that they could throw them a great way with good aim so i kept at a distance but talked with them by signs as well as i could and particularly made signs for something to eat they beckoned to me to stop my boat and they would fetch me some meat upon this i lowered the top of my sail and lay by and two of them ran up into the country and in less than came back and brought with them two pieces of dried flesh and some corn such as is the produce of their country but we neither knew what the one or the other was however we were willing to accept it but how to come at it was our next dispute for i would not venture on shore to them and they were as much afraid of us but they took a safe way for us all for they brought it to the shore and laid it down and went and stood a great way off till we fetched it on board and then came close to us again we made signs of thanks to them for we had nothing to make them amends but an opportunity offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully for while we were lying by the shore came two mighty creatures one pursuing the other as we took it with great fury from the mountains towards the sea whether it was the male pursuing the female or whether they were in sport or in rage we could not tell any more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange but i believe it was the latter because in the first place those ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night and in the second place we found the people terribly frighted especially the women the man that had the lance or dart did not fly from them but the rest did however as the two creatures ran directly into the water they did not offer to fall upon any of the negroes but plunged themselves into the sea and swam about as if they had come for their diversion at last one of them began to come nearer our boat than at first i expected but i lay ready for him for i had loaded my gun with all possible expedition and bade xury load both the others as soon as he came fairly within my reach i fired and shot him directly in the head immediately he sank down into the water but rose instantly and plunged up and down as if he were struggling for life and so indeed he was he immediately made to the shore but between the wound which was his mortal hurt and the strangling of the water he died just before he reached the shore it is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at the noise and fire of my gun some of them were even ready to die for fear and fell down as dead with the very terror but when they saw the creature dead and sunk in the water and that i made signs to them to come to the shore they took heart and came and began to search for the creature i found him by his blood staining the water and by the help of a rope which i slung round him and gave the negroes to haul they dragged him on shore and found that it was a most curious leopard spotted and fine to an admirable degree and the negroes held up their hands with admiration to think what it was i had killed him with the mahar temple the aborigine apparently uninjured climbed quickly into the skiff and seizing the spear with me helped to hold off the infuriated creature blood from the wounded reptile was now crimsoning the waters about us and soon from the weakening struggles it became evident that i had inflicted a death wound upon it presently its efforts to reach us ceased entirely and with a few convulsive movements it turned upon its back quite dead and then there came to me a sudden realization of the predicament in which i had placed myself i was entirely within the power of the savage man whose skiff i had stolen still clinging to the spear i looked into his face to find him scrutinizing me intently and there we stood for some several minutes each clinging tenaciously to the weapon the while we gazed in stupid wonderment at each other what was in his mind i do not know but in my own was merely the question as to how soon the fellow would recommence hostilities presently he spoke to me but in a tongue which i was unable to translate i shook my head in an effort to indicate my ignorance of his language at the same time addressing him in the bastard tongue that the sagoths use to converse with the human slaves of the mahars to my delight he understood and answered me in the same jargon what do you want of my spear he asked only to keep you from running it through me i replied i would not do that he said for you have just saved my life and with that he released his hold upon it and squatted down in the bottom of the skiff who are you he continued and from what country do you come i too sat down laying the spear between us and tried to explain how i came to pellucidar and wherefrom but it was as impossible for him to grasp or believe the strange tale i told him as i fear it is for you upon the outer crust to believe in the existence of the inner world to him it seemed quite ridiculous to imagine that there was another world far beneath his feet peopled by beings similar to himself and he laughed uproariously the more he thought upon it but it was ever thus that which has never come within the scope of our really pitifully meager cannot be our finite minds cannot grasp that which may not exist in accordance with the conditions which obtain about us upon the outside of the insignificant grain of dust which wends its tiny way among the bowlders of the universe the speck of moist dirt we so proudly call the world so i gave it up and asked him about himself he said he was a mezop and that his name was ja who are the mezops i asked where do they live he looked at me in surprise i might indeed believe that you were from another world he said for who of pellucidar could be so ignorant the mezops live upon the islands of the seas in so far as i ever have heard no mezop lives elsewhere and no others than mezops dwell upon islands but of course it may be different in other lands i do not know at any rate in this sea and those near by it is true that only people of my race inhabit the islands we are fishermen though we be great hunters as well often going to the mainland in search of the game that is scarce upon all but the larger islands and we are warriors also he added proudly even the sagoths of the mahars fear us once when pellucidar was young the sagoths were wont to capture us for slaves as they do the other men of pellucidar it is handed down from father to son among us that this is so but we fought so desperately and slew so many sagoths and those of us that were captured killed so many mahars in their own cities that at last they learned that it were better to leave us alone and later came the time that the mahars became too indolent even to catch their own fish except for amusement and then they needed us to supply their wants and so a truce was made between the races now they give us certain things which we are unable to produce in return for the fish that we catch and the mezops and the mahars live in peace the great ones even come to our islands it is there far from the prying eyes of their own sagoths that they practice their religious rites in the temples they have builded there with our assistance if you live among us you will doubtless see the manner of their worship which is strange indeed and most unpleasant for the poor slaves they bring to take part in it as ja talked i had an excellent opportunity to inspect him more closely he was a huge fellow standing i should say six feet six or seven inches well developed and of a coppery red not unlike that of our own north american indian nor were his features dissimilar to theirs he had the aquiline nose found among many of the higher tribes the prominent cheek bones and black hair and eyes but his mouth and lips were better molded all in all ja was an impressive and handsome creature and he talked well too even in the miserable makeshift language we were compelled to use introduction the author does not intend to apologize for what many readers may call the brutality of the story but rather to explain that its wild spirit is true to the life of the western border as it was known only a little more than one hundred years ago the writer is the fortunate possessor of historical material of undoubted truth and interest it is the journal of colonel ebenezer zane one of the most prominent of the who labored in the settlement of the western country the story of that tragic period deserves a higher place in historical literature than it has thus far been given and this unquestionably because of a lack of authentic data regarding the conquering of the wilderness considering how many years the pioneers struggled on the border of this country the history of their efforts is meager and obscure if the years at the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century were full of stirring adventure on the part of the colonists along the atlantic coast how crowded must they have been for the almost forgotten pioneers who daringly invaded the trackless wilds none there was to chronicle the fight of these sturdy travelers toward the setting sun the story of their stormy lives of their heroism and of their sacrifice for the benefit of future generations is too little known it is to a better understanding of those days that the author has labored to draw from his ancestor's notes a new and striking portrayal of the frontier one which shall paint the fever of freedom that powerful impulse which lured so many to unmarked graves one which shall show his work his love the effect of the causes which rendered his life so hard and surely one which does not forget the wronged indian the frontier in produced white men so savage as to be men in name only these outcasts and renegades lived among the savages and during thirty years harassed the border perpetrating all manner of fiendish cruelties upon the settlers they were no less cruel to the redmen whom they ruled and at the height of their bloody careers made futile the moravian missionaries long labors and destroyed the beautiful hamlet of the christian indians called gnaddenhutten or village of peace and while the border produced such outlaws so did it produce hunters eke boone the zanes the mccollochs and wetzel that strange silent man whose deeds are still whispered in the country where he once roamed in his insatiate pursuit of savages and renegades and who was purely a product of the times civilization could not have brought forth a man like wetzel great revolutions great crises great moments come and produce the men to deal with them the border needed wetzel the settlers would have needed many more years in which to make permanent homes had it not been for him he was never a pioneer but always a hunter after indians when not on the track of the savage foe he was in the settlement with his keen eye and ear ever alert for signs of the enemy to the superstitious indians he was a shadow a spirit of the border which breathed menace from the dark forests to the settlers he was the right arm of defense a fitting leader for those few implacable and unerring frontiersmen who made the settlement of the west a possibility and if this story of one of his relentless pursuits shows the man as he truly was loved by pioneers respected and feared by redmen and hated by renegades if it softens a little the ruthless name history accords him the writer will have been well repaid z g the spirit of the border chapter i nell i'm growing powerful fond of you so you must be master joe if often telling makes it true the girl spoke simply and with an absence of that roguishness which was characteristic of her playful words arch smiles and a touch of coquetry had seemed natural to nell but now her grave tone and her almost wistful glance disconcerted joe during all the long journey over the mountains she had been gay and bright while now when they were about to part perhaps never to meet again she showed him the deeper and more earnest side of her character it checked his boldness as nothing else had done suddenly there came to him the real meaning of a woman's love when she bestows it without reservation silenced by the thought that he had not understood her at all and the knowledge that he had been half in sport he gazed out over the wild country before them the scene impressed its quietness upon the young couple and brought more forcibly to their minds the fact that they were at the gateway of the unknown west that somewhere beyond this rude frontier settlement out there in those unbroken forests stretching dark and silent before them was to be their future home from the high bank where they stood the land sloped and narrowed gradually until it ended in a sharp point which marked the last bit of land between the allegheny and monongahela rivers here these swift streams merged and formed the broad ohio the river even here at its beginning proud and swelling as if already certain of its grandeur swept majestically round a wide curve and apparently lost itself in the forest foliage iii the auricular talent of the hon samuel budd behind us came the hon samuel budd just when the sun was slitting the east with a long streak of fire the hon samuel was with the jocund day standing tiptoe in his stirrups on the misty mountain top and peering into the ravine down which we had slid the night before and he grumbled no little when he saw that he too must get off his horse and slide down the hon samuel was ambitious southern and a lawyer without saying it goes that he was also a politician he was not a native of the mountains but he had cast his fortunes in the highlands and he was taking the first step that he hoped would before many years land him in the national capitol he really knew little about the mountaineers even now and he had never been among his constituents on devil's fork where he was bound now the campaign had so far been full of humor and full of trials not the least of which sprang from the fact that it was sorghum time everybody through the mountains was making sorghum and every mountain child was eating molasses now as the world knows the straightest way to the heart of the honest voter is through the women of the land and the straightest way to the heart of the women is through the children of the land and one method of winning both with rural politicians is to kiss the babies wide and far so as each infant at sorghum time has a circle of stickiness about his chubby lips and as the hon sam was averse to long sweetenin even in his coffee this particular political device just now was no small trial to the hon samuel budd but in the language of one of his firmest supporters uncle tommie hendricks the hon sam done his duty and he done it damn well the issue at stake was the site of the new two localities claiming the right undisputed because they were the only two places in the county where there was enough level land for the to stand on let no man think this a trivial issue there had been a similar one over on the virginia side once and the opposing factions agreed to decide the question by the ancient wager of battle fist and skull two hundred men on each side and the women of the county with difficulty prevented the fight just now mr budd was on his way to the pocket the voting place of one faction where he had never been where the hostility against him was most bitter and that day he knew he was up against waterloo the crossing of the rubicon holding the pass at thermopylae or any other historical crisis in the history of man i was saddling the mules when the cackling of geese in the creek announced the coming of the hon samuel budd coming with his chin on his in thought still his eyes beamed cheerily he lifted his slouched hat gallantly to the blight and the little sister and he would wait for us to jog along with him i told him of our troubles meanwhile the wild dog had restored our mules and the hon sam beamed he's a wonder where is he he never waited even for thanks again the hon sam beamed ah just like him he's gone ahead to help me well how did he happen to be here i asked he's everywhere said the hon sam how did he know the mules were ours easy that boy knows everything well why did he bring them back and then leave so mysteriously the hon sam silently pointed a finger at the laughing blight ahead and i looked incredulous just the same that's another reason i told you to warn marston he's already got it in his head that marston is his rival pshaw i said for it was too ridiculous all right said the hon sam placidly then why doesn't he want to see her how do you know he ain't watchin her now for all we know mark me he added you won't see him at the speakin but i'll bet fruit cake agin gingerbread he'll be somewhere around so we went on the two girls leading the way and the hon sam now telling his political troubles to me half a mile down the road a solitary horseman stood waiting and mr budd gave a low whistle one o my rivals he said from the corner of his mouth mornin said the horseman lemme see you a minute he made a movement to draw aside but the hon samuel made a of dissent this gentleman is a friend of mine he said firmly but with great courtesy and he can hear what you have to say to me the mountaineer rubbed one huge hand over his stubbly chin threw one of his long legs over the pommel of his saddle and dangled a heavy cowhide shoe to and fro would you mind tellin me whut pay a member of the house of legislatur gits a day the hon sam looked surprised i think about two dollars and a half chapter viii in the throes of fever a ghastly discovery pitiful relics a critical moment yamba in danger a blood bath a luxury indeed signs of civilisation the great storm drifting drifting yamba's mysterious glee a dreadful shock welcome home my official protectors myself as a cannibal war chief preparations for battle a weird apparition generosity to the vanquished the old desire i had not been established in this camp many days however before i was struck down for the first time with a terrible attack of malarial fever probably produced by the many hours i had spent wading in the swamps at port essington there were the usual symptoms quick flushings and fever heats followed by violent fits of shivering which no amount of natural warmth could mitigate my faithful yamba was terribly distressed at my condition and waited upon me with most tender devotion but in spite of all that could be done for me i grew gradually weaker until in the course of a few days i became wildly delirious the blacks too were very good to me and doctored me in their quaint native way with certain leaves and powders all to no purpose however and for several days i was even unable to recognise my yamba then the fever subsided somewhat and i was left as weak and helpless as a little child it was some time before i quite recovered from the fever and i was frequently seized with distressing fits of shivering i also experienced an overwhelming desire for a drink of milk why i am unable to say therefore when some of the blacks told me that wild buffalo were to be found in the neighbourhood beasts which had formerly belonged to settlers but were now run wild i resolved when sufficiently strong to try and capture one of the cows for the sake of its milk captain davis ridiculed the idea and assured me that it was only possible to slay one with a rifle but i determined to see what i could do yamba of course accompanied me on my expedition and her bushmanship was altogether quite indispensable we came upon buffalo tracks near a large and here we each climbed a and awaited the arrival of our prey we waited a long time but were at length rewarded by seeing a big cow buffalo and her calf wandering leisurely in our direction my only weapons were a lasso made out of green kangaroo hide fixed to the end of a long pole and my bow and arrows i slid down the tree a little way and when the calf was near enough i gently slipped the noose over its neck and promptly made it a prisoner under the very nose of its astonished mother who bellowed mournfully my success so elated yamba that she too slid down from her and was making her way over to me and the calf when suddenly an enormous bull which we had not previously seen rushed at her at full speed yamba instantly realised her danger and swarmed up a tree again like lightning just as the great brute was upon her i called out to her to attract the attention of the old bull whilst i attended to the mother and calf i dropped my pole to which the lasso was attached and allowed the little one to walk quickly away with it but as i anticipated the trailing shaft soon caught between the stumps of some trees and made the calf a more secure prisoner than ever it was a curious repetition of the story of the two whales the mother walked round and round and appeared to be in the greatest distress she never left her little one's side but continued to bellow loudly and lick the calf to coax it away quietly sliding down my tree i made my way to where yamba was still holding the attention of the bull a fiery brute who was pawing the ground with rage at the foot of her tree i had fitted an arrow to my bow and was preparing to shoot when unfortunately the bull detected the noise of my approach and rushed straight at me i confess it was rather a trying moment but i never lost my head feeling confident of my skill with the bow which i had practised off and on ever since i had left school at montreux i actually waited until the charging monster was within a few paces and then i let fly so close was he that not much credit is due to me for accurate aim the arrow fairly transfixed his right eye causing him to pull up on his haunches and roar with pain yamba full of anxiety hurried down her tree but she had scarcely reached the ground when the baffled bull wheeled and charged her with more fury than ever she simply glided behind a tree and then i showed myself and induced the bull to charge me once more again i waited until he was almost upon me and then i sent another arrow into his other eye blinding him completely on this the poor brute brought up sharp and commenced to back in an uncertain way bellowing with pain i forgot all my fever in the excitement and rushing upon the beast with my tomahawk i dealt him a blow on the side of the head that made him stagger i brought him to the earth with two or three more blows and a few minutes later had administered the no sooner was the big bull dead than i determined to test the efficacy of a very popular native remedy for fever for shivering fits still continued to come upon me at most awkward times usually late in the day no matter how much grass poor yamba brought me as covering i never could get warm and so now i thought i would try some animal heat changes at forlorn river the first of march saw the federal occupation of the garrison at casita after a short decisive engagement the rebels were dispersed into small bands and driven eastward along the boundary line toward nogales it was the destiny of forlorn river however never to return to the slow sleepy tenor of its former existence belding's predictions came true that straggling line of was but a forerunner of the real invasion of altar valley refugees from mexico and from casita spread the word that water and wood and grass and land were to be had at forlorn river and as if by magic the white tents and red adobe houses sprang up to glisten in the sun belding was happier than he had been for a long time he believed that evil days for forlorn river along with the apathy and lack of enterprise were in the past he hired a couple of trustworthy mexicans to ride the boundary line and he settled down to think of ranching and irrigation and mining projects every morning he expected to receive some word form sonoyta or yuma telling him that yaqui had guided his party safely across the desert belding was a man more inclined to action than reflection when the complexities of life hemmed him in he groped his way out never quite understanding his wife had always been a mystery to him nell was sunshine most of the time but like the desert she was subject to strange changes wilful stormy sudden it was enough for belding now to find his wife in a lighter happier mood and to see nell dreamily turning a ring round and round the third finger of her left hand and watching the west every day both mother and daughter appeared farther removed from the past darkly threatening days belding was hearty in his affections but undemonstrative if there was any sentiment in his it had an outlet in his memory of blanco diablo and a longing to see him often belding stopped his work to gaze out over the desert toward the west when he thought of his rangers and thorne and mercedes he certainly never forgot his horse he wondered if diablo was running walking resting if yaqui was finding water and grass in march with the short desert winter over the days began to grow warm the noon hours were hot and seemed to give promise of the white summer blaze and blasting furnace wind soon to come no word was received from the rangers but this caused belding no concern and it seemed to him that his women folk considered no news good news among the many changes coming to pass in forlorn river were the installing of service and the building of a mescal belding had worked hard for the post office but he did not like the idea of a saloon for forlorn river still that was an inevitable evil the mexicans would have mescal belding had kept the little border hamlet free of an establishment for distillation of the fiery cactus drink a good many americans drifted into forlorn river miners cowboys prospectors outlaws and others of nondescript character and these men of course made the saloon which was also an inn their headquarters belding with carter and other old residents saw the need of a sheriff for forlorn river one morning early in this spring month while belding was on his way from the house to the corrals he saw nell running blanco jose down the road at a gait that amazed him she did not take the turn of the road to come in by the gate she put jose at a wire fence and came clattering into the yard nell must have another tantrum said belding she's long past due blanco jose like the other white horses was big of frame and heavy and thunder rolled from under his great hoofs nell pulled him up and as he pounded and slid to a halt in a cloud of dust she swung lightly down it did not take more than half an eye for belding to see that she was furious nell what's come off now asked belding i'm not going to tell you she replied and started away leading jose toward the corral belding leisurely followed she went into the corral removed jose's bridle and led him to the belding came up and without saying anything began to unbuckle jose's saddle girths but he ventured a look at nell the red had gone from her face and he was surprised to see her eyes brimming with tears most assuredly this was not one of nell's tantrums while taking off jose's saddle and hanging it in the shed belding pondered in his slow way when he came back to the corral nell had her face against the bars and she was crying he slipped a big arm around her and waited although it was not often expressed there was a strong attachment between them dad i don't want you to think me a a baby any more she said i've been insulted with a specific fact to make clear thought in belding's mind he was never slow i knew something unusual had come off i guess you'd better tell me contents i reluctance ii why men don't marry iii a change of heart iv a repentant sinner v twixt will and will not vi which shall it be vii marriage by compulsion viii all's well that ends well frivolous cupid i reluctance i neither life nor the club was so full at natterley that the news of harry sterling's return had not some importance he came back moreover to assume a position very different from his old one he had left harrow now departing in the sweet aroma of a long score against eton at lord's and was to go up to oxford in october now between a schoolboy and a university man there is a gulf indicated unmistakably by the cigarette which adorned harry's mouth as he walked down the street with a newly acquiescent father and thoroughly realized by his old playmates the young men greeted him as an equal the boys grudgingly accepted his superiority and the girls received him much as though they had never met him before in their lives and were pressingly in need of an introduction these features of his reappearance amused mrs mortimer she recollected him as an untidy shy pretty boy but mind working on matter had so transformed him that she was doubtful enough about him to ask her husband if that were really harry sterling mr mortimer mopping his bald head after one of his energetic failures at lawn tennis grunted assent and remarked that a few years more would see a like development in their elder son a remark which bordered on absurdity for johnny was but eight and ten years are not a few years to a lady of whatever they may seem to a man of presently harry shaking himself free from an entangling group of the vicarage girls joined his father and the two came across to mrs mortimer she was a favorite of old sterling's and he was proud to present his handsome son to her she listened graciously to his jocosities stealing a glance at harry when his father called him a good boy harry blushed and assumed an air of indifference tossing his hair back from his smooth forehead and swinging his racket carelessly in his hand the lady addressed some words of patronizing kindness to him seeking to put him at his ease she seemed to succeed to some extent for he let his father and her husband go off together and sat down by her on the bench regardless of the fact that the vicarage girls were waiting for him to make a fourth he said nothing and mrs mortimer looked at him from under her long lashes in so doing she discovered that he was looking at her aren't you going to play any more mr sterling she asked why aren't you playing he rejoined my husband says i play too badly oh play with me we shall make a good pair then you must be very good well no one can play a hang here you know besides i'm sure you're all right really you forget my weight of years he opened his blue eyes a little and laughed he was in fact astonished to find that she was quite a young woman remembering old mortimer and the babies he had thought of her as full but she was not nor had she that likeness to a suet pudding which his newborn critical faculty cruelly detected in his old friends the vicarage girls there was one of them maudie with whom he had flirted in his holidays he wondered at that especially when a relentless memory told him that mrs mortimer must have been at the parties where the thing went on he felt very much older so much older that mrs mortimer became at once a contemporary why then should she begin as she now did to talk to him in quasi maternal fashion about his prospects men don't have prospects or anyhow are spared questionings thereon either from impatience of this topic or because after all tennis was not to be neglected he left her and she sat alone for a little while watching him play she was glad that she had not played she could not have rivaled the activity of the vicarage girls she got up and joined mrs sterling who was presiding over the club teapot the good lady expected compliments on her son but for some reason mrs mortimer gave her none very soon indeed she took johnnie away with her leaving her husband to follow at his leisure in comparing maudie sinclair to a suet pudding harry had looked at the dark side of the matter the suggestion though indisputable was only occasionally obtrusive and as a rule hushed almost to silence by the pleasant good nature which redeemed shapeless features mrs mortimer had always liked maudie who ran in and out of her house continually and had made of herself a to the little children the very next day she came and in the intervals of playing cricket with johnnie took occasion to inform mrs mortimer that in her opinion harry sterling was by no means improved by his new status and dignity she went so far as to use the term he didn't use to be like that she said shaking her head he used to be very jolly mrs mortimer was relieved to note an entire absence of romance either in the regretted past or the condemned present maudie mourned a friend spoiled not an admirer lost the tone of her criticisms left no doubt of it and mrs mortimer with a laugh announced her intention of asking the sterlings to dinner and having maudie to meet them you will be able to make it up

irvings came back to echo lodge for the summer and anne spent a happy three weeks there in july miss lavendar had not changed charlotta the fourth was a very young lady now but still adored anne sincerely when said and done miss shirley i seen any one in boston equal to you she said frankly paul was almost grown up too he was sixteen his chestnut curls had given place to brown locks and he was more interested in football than fairies but the bond between him and his old teacher still held kindred spirits alone do not change with changing years it was a wet bleak cruel evening in july when anne came back to green gables one of the fierce summer storms which sometimes sweep over the gulf was ravaging the sea as anne came in the first raindrops dashed against the panes was that paul who brought you home asked marilla why you make him stay all night going to be a wild evening reach echo lodge before the rain gets very heavy i think anyway he wanted to go back tonight well had a splendid visit but glad to see you dear folks again east west best davy have you been growing again lately growed a whole inch since you left said davy proudly as tall as milty boulter now i glad have to stop crowing about being bigger say anne did you know that gilbert blythe is dying anne stood quite silent and motionless looking at davy her face had gone so white that marilla thought she was going to faint davy hold your tongue said mrs rachel angrily anne look like that look like that we mean to tell you so suddenly is it true asked anne in a voice that was not hers gilbert is very ill said mrs lynde gravely he took down with typhoid fever just after you left for echo lodge did you never hear of it no said that unknown voice it was a very bad case from the start the doctor said been terribly run down a trained nurse and been done look like that anne while life hope mr harrison was here this evening and he said they had no hope of him reiterated davy marilla looking old and worn and tired got up and marched davy grimly out of the kitchen oh look so dear said mrs rachel putting her kind old arms about the pallid girl i given up hope indeed i got the blythe constitution in his favor what anne gently put mrs arms away from her walked blindly across the kitchen through the hall up the stairs to her old room at its window she knelt down staring out unseeingly it was very dark the rain was beating down over the shivering fields the haunted woods was full of the groans of mighty trees wrung in the tempest and the air throbbed with the thunderous crash of billows on the distant shore and gilbert was dying there is a book of revelation in every life as there is in the bible anne read hers that bitter night as she kept her agonized vigil through the hours of storm and darkness she loved gilbert had always loved him she knew that now she knew that she could no more cast him out of her life without agony than she could have cut off her right hand and cast it from her and the knowledge had come too late too late even for the bitter solace of being with him at the last if she had not been so blind so foolish she would have had the right to go to him now but he would never know that she loved him he would go away from this life thinking that she did not care oh the black years of emptiness stretching before her she could not live through them she could not she cowered down by her window and wished for the first time in her gay young life that she could die too if gilbert went away from her without one word or sign or message she could not live nothing was of any value without him she belonged to him and he to her in her hour of supreme agony she had no doubt of that he did not love christine stuart never had loved christine stuart oh what a fool she had been not to realize what the bond was that had held her to gilbert to think that the flattered fancy she had felt for roy gardner had been love and now she must pay for her folly as for a crime mrs lynde and marilla crept to her door before they went to bed shook their heads doubtfully at each other over the silence and went away the storm raged all night but when the dawn came it was spent anne saw a fairy fringe of light on the skirts of darkness soon the eastern hilltops had a ruby rim the clouds rolled themselves away into great soft white masses on the horizon the sky gleamed blue and silvery a hush fell over the world chapter xxiv a tantalizing revelation i shall have something to tell you in the orchard this evening said the story girl at breakfast one morning her eyes were very bright and excited she looked as if she had not slept a great deal she had spent the previous evening with miss reade and had not returned until the rest of us were in bed miss reade had finished giving music lessons and was going home in a few days cecily and felicity were in despair over this and mourned as those without comfort but the story girl who had been even more devoted to miss reade than either of them had not as i noticed expressed any regret and seemed to be very cheerful over the whole matter why you tell it now asked felicity because the evening is the nicest time to tell things in i only mentioned it now so that you would have something interesting to look forward to all day is it about miss reade asked cecily never mind bet going to be married i exclaimed remembering the ring is she cried felicity and cecily together the story girl threw an annoyed glance at me she did not like to have her dramatic announcements forestalled i say that it is about miss reade or that it you must just wait till the evening i wonder what it is speculated cecily as the story girl left the room i believe much of anything said felicity beginning to clear away the breakfast dishes the story girl always likes to make so much out of so little anyhow i believe miss reade is going to be married she any beaus around here and mrs armstrong says sure she correspond with anybody besides if she was she be likely to tell the story girl oh she might such friends you know said cecily miss reade is no better friends with her than she is with me and you retorted felicity no but sometimes it seems to me that a different kind of friend with the story girl than she is with me and you reflected cecily i just explain what i mean no wonder such nonsense sniffed felicity only some secret anyway said dan loftily i feel much interest in it but he was on hand with the rest of us that evening interest or no interest in uncle walk where the ripening apples were beginning to glow like jewels among the boughs now are you going to tell us your news asked felicity impatiently miss reade is going to be married said the story girl she told me so last night she is going to be married in a time who to exclaimed the girls to the story girl threw a defiant glance at me as if to say you spoil the surprise of this anyway tothe awkward man for a few moments amazement literally held us dumb not in earnest sara stanley gasped felicity at last indeed i am i thought be astonished but i suspected it all summer from little things noticed you remember that evening last spring when i went a piece with miss reade and told you when i came back that a story was growing i guessed it from the way the awkward man looked at her when i stopped to speak to him over his garden fence but the awkward man said felicity helplessly it seem possible did miss reade tell you herself yes i suppose it must be true then but how did it ever come about so shy and awkward how did he ever manage to get up enough spunk to ask her to marry him maybe she asked him suggested dan the story girl looked as if she might tell if she would i believe that was the way of it i said to draw her on not exactly she said reluctantly i know all about it but i tell you i guessed part from things seen and miss reade told me a good deal and the awkward man himself told me his side of it as we came home last night i met him just as i left mr and we were together as far as his house it was dark and he just talked on as if he were talking to himself i think he forgot i was there at all once he got started he has never been shy or awkward with me but he never talked as he did last night you might tell us what he said urged cecily never tell the story girl shook her head no i you understand besides i tell it just right one of the things that are hardest to tell spoil it if i told it now perhaps some day be able to tell it properly very beautiful but it might sound very ridiculous if it told just exactly the right way i know what you mean and i believe you know yourself said felicity pettishly all that i can make out is that miss reade is going to marry jasper dale and i like the idea one bit she is so beautiful and sweet i thought marry some dashing young man jasper dale must be nearly twenty years older than her and so queer and shy and such a hermit a trap is sprung long before prince von der tann reached lustadt he had come to the conclusion that leopold was in virtue a prisoner in blentz to prove his conclusion he directed one of his staff to return to blentz and attempt to have audience with the king risk anything he instructed the officer to whom he had entrusted the mission submit if necessary to the humiliation of seeking an austrian pass through the lines to the castle see the king at any cost and deliver this message to him and to him alone and secretly tell him my fears and that if i do not have word from him within hours i shall assume that he is indeed a prisoner i shall then direct the mobilization of the army and take such steps as seem fit to rescue him and drive the invaders from the soil of lutha if you do not return i shall understand that you are held prisoner by the austrians and that my worst fears have been realized but prince ludwig was one who believed in being forehanded and so it happened that the orders for the mobilization of the army of lutha were issued within fifteen minutes of his return to lustadt it would do no harm thought the old man with a grim smile to get things well under way a day ahead of time this accomplished he summoned the serbian minister with what purpose and to what effect became historically evident several days later when after hours absence his aide had not returned from blentz the chancellor had no regrets for his forehandedness in the castle of peter of blentz the king of lutha was being entertained royally he was told nothing of the attempt of his chancellor to see him nor did he know that a messenger from prince von der tann was being held a prisoner in the camp of the austrians in the village he was surrounded by the creatures of prince peter and by peter's staunch allies the austrian minister and the austrian officers attached to the expeditionary force occupying the town they told him that they had positive information that the serbians already had crossed the frontier into lutha and that the presence of the austrian troops was purely for the protection of lutha it was not until the morning following the rebuff of prince von der tann that peter of blentz count zellerndorf and maenck heard of the occurrence they were chagrined by the accident for they were not ready to deliver their final stroke the young officer of the guard had of course but followed his instructions who would have thought that old von der tann would come to blentz that he suspected their motives seemed apparent and now that his rebuff at the gates had aroused his ire and doubtless crystallized his suspicions they might find in him a very ugly obstacle to the fruition of their plans with von der tann actively opposed to them the value of having the king upon their side would be greatly minimized the people and the army had every confidence in the old chancellor even if he opposed the king there was reason to believe that they might still side with him what is to be done asked zellerndorf is there no way either to win or force von der tann to acquiescence i think we can accomplish it said prince peter after a moment of thought let us see leopold his mind has been prepared to receive almost gratefully any insinuations against the loyalty of von der tann with proper evidence the king may easily be persuaded to order the chancellor's arrest possibly his execution as well so they saw the king only to meet a stubborn refusal upon the part of leopold to accede to their suggestions he still was madly in love with von der tann's daughter and he knew that a blow delivered at her father would only tend to increase her bitterness toward him the conspirators were nonplussed they had looked for a comparatively easy road to the consummation of their desires what in the world could be the cause of the king's stubborn desire to protect the man they knew he feared hated and mistrusted with all the energy of his suspicious nature it was the king himself who answered their unspoken question i cannot believe in the disloyalty of prince ludwig he said nor could i even if i desired it take such drastic steps as you suggest some day the princess emma his daughter will be my queen count zellerndorf was the first to grasp the possibilities that lay in the suggestion the king's words carried your majesty he cried there is a way to unite all factions in lutha it would be better to insure the loyalty of von der tann through bonds of kinship than to antagonize him marry the princess emma at once wait your majesty he added as leopold raised an objecting hand i am well informed as to the strange obstinacy of the princess but for the welfare of the state yes for the sake of your very throne sire you should exert your royal prerogatives and command the princess emma to carry out the terms of your betrothal max beerbohm i was shocked this morning when i saw in my newspaper a paragraph announcing his sudden death i do not say that the shock was very disagreeable one reads a newspaper for the sake of news had i never met james pethel belike i should never have heard of him and my knowledge of his death coincident with my knowledge that he had existed would have meant nothing at all to me if you learn suddenly that one of your friends is dead you are wholly distressed if the death is that of a mere acquaintance whom you have recently seen you are disconcerted pricked is your sense of mortality but you do find great solace in telling other people that you met the poor fellow only the other day and that he was so full of life and spirits and that you remember he said whatever you may remember of his sayings if the death is that of a mere acquaintance whom you have not seen for years you are touched so lightly as to find solace enough in even such faded reminiscence as is yours to offer seven years have passed since the day when last i saw james pethel and that day was the morrow of my first meeting with him i had formed the habit of spending august in dieppe the place was then less overrun by trippers than it is now some pleasant english people shared it with some pleasant french people we used rather to resent the the third week of the month as an intrusion on our privacy we sneered as we read in the paris edition of the new york herald the names of the intruders though by some of these we were secretly impressed we disliked the nightly crush in the of the casino and the croupiers obvious excitement at the high play i made a point of avoiding that room during that week for the special reason that the sight of serious habitual gamblers has always filled me with a depression bordering on disgust most of the men by some subtle stress of their ruling passion have grown so monstrously fat and most of the women so harrowingly thin the rest of the women seem to be marked out for apoplexy and the rest of the men to be wasting away one feels that anything thrown at them would be either embedded or shattered and looks vainly among them for one person furnished with a normal amount of flesh monsters they are all of them to the eye though i believe that many of them have excellent moral qualities in private life but just as in an american town one goes sooner or later goes against one's finer judgment but somehow goes into the so year by year in dieppe's there would be always one evening when i drifted into the it was on such an evening that i first saw the man whose memory i here celebrate my gaze was held by him for the very reason that he would have passed unnoticed elsewhere he was conspicuous not in virtue of the mere fact that he was taking the bank at the principal table but because there was nothing at all odd about him he alone among his looked as if he were not to die before the year was out of him alone i said to myself that he was destined to die normally at a ripe old age next day certainly i would not have made this prediction would not have given him the seven years that were still in store for him nor the comparatively normal death that has been his but now as i stood opposite to him behind the croupier i was refreshed by my sense of his wholesome durability everything about him except the amount of money he had been winning seemed moderate just as he was neither fat nor thin so had his face neither that extreme pallor nor that extreme redness which belongs to the faces of seasoned gamblers it was just a clear pink and his eyes had neither the unnatural brightness nor the unnatural dullness of the eyes about him they were ordinarily clear eyes of an ordinary gray his very age was moderate a putative not more not less i would have said in those days he assumed no air of nonchalance he did not deal out the cards as though they bored him but he had no look of grim concentration i noticed that the removal of his cigar from his mouth made never the least difference to his face for he kept his lips pursed out as steadily as ever when he was not smoking and this constant pursing of his lips seemed to denote just a pensive interest his bank was nearly done now there were only a few cards left opposite to him was a welter of counters that the croupier had not yet had time to sort out and add to the rouleaux already made there were also a fair accumulation of notes and several little stacks of gold in all not less than pounds certainly happy banker how easily had he won in a few minutes more than i with utmost pains could win in many months i wished i were he his lucre seemed to insult me personally i disliked him and yet i hoped he would not take another bank i hoped he would have the good sense to pocket his winnings and go home deliberately to risk the loss of all those riches would intensify the insult to me after the cash tom's proposal as a way out of the difficulty and the prompt seconding of it by mr damon seemed to deprive the other bank officials mr swift included of the power of speech for a few moments then as there came to the room where the scene had taken place the sound of the mob outside clamoring for cash mr pendergast the president remarked in a low voice it seems to be the only way do you think you can do it tom swift i'm sure of it as far as my electric car is concerned replied the young inventor if we get the cash i'll have it back here on time the runabout is all ready for a fast trip then don't lose any time tom advised his father every minute counts yes added mr damon come on i've got the securities in my valise and we can bring the cash back in the same satchel come on tom the eccentric character caught up his valise and started from the room tom followed now my son be careful advised his father you know the need of haste but don't take unnecessary risks you'd better go out the back way as the crowd is easily excited little more was said mr swift clasped his son's hand in a firm pressure and the bank president nervously bade the lad then slipping out of the bank by the rear entrance the porter closing the door after them tom and mr damon took their places in the electric machine just imagine you're racing for that prize offered by the touring club of america tom observed mr damon as he deposited the valise at his feet i don't have to do that replied the youth i'm trying for a bigger prize than that i want to save the bank and defeat the schemes of the fogers father and son tom turned on the power and the machine rolled out on the main street as it turned the corner leaving the impatient crowd of depositors now larger than ever behind mr damon glanced over at the new bank and as he did so he called to tom there are the fogers now the young inventor looked and saw andy and his father on the steps of the new institution at the sight of the electric car speeding along andy turned and spoke to his parent what he said seemed to impress mr foger for he started and looked more intently at tom and mr damon then as tom watched he saw the two excitedly conversing and a moment later andy ran off in the direction in which sam snedecker and pete bailey lived i wonder if he's up to any tricks thought tom as he turned on more power well if he is i'll soon be where he can't reach me the young inventor did not dare send his car at full speed through the streets of the town and it was not until several minutes had passed that they could go at more than the ordinary rate but once the open country was reached tom opened her up full and the song the motor sung was one of power the vehicle quickly gathered headway and was soon fairly whizzing along if we keep this up we'll be there and back in good time remarked mr damon yes but we can't do it replied his companion the road to clayton is a poor one and we'll soon be on it then we'll have to go slow but i'll make all the time i can until then so for several miles more they crept along at times having to reduce to almost a walking pace because of bad roads mr damon looked at his watch almost every other minute eleven o'clock he remarked as they passed a milestone and we're not half way there bless my gizzard but i'm afraid we won't make it tom we left about ten and we ought to be back by two o'clock to do any good that's four hours and it will take some time to transfer the securities and get the cash every minute counts i know it answered tom and i'm going to count every minute with eager eyes he watched every inch of the road to steer to the best advantage his hands gripped the wheel until his knuckles showed white with the strain and every now and then his right hand adjusted the speed lever or the controller handle while his foot was on the emergency brake ready to stop the car at the first sign of danger and there was danger not infrequently for the road was up and down hill over frail bridges and along steep cliffs it was no pleasure tour they were on when a little over half the distance had been made they came to a better road and tom was able to use full speed ahead then the electric went so fast that had it not been for the steel in front mr damon at any rate would have been short of breath this is going some he cried to tom the lad nodded grimly and shoved the controller handle over to the last notch then came a bad stretch and they had to slow down again as they were about out of it there came a little flash of fire and the motor stopped chapter i

outstretched palm a wind slightly perfumed with the odour of melting snow and unsheathing buds swept the lake beside them and lifted a waving tangle of light hair on the brow of the man while a level

man gazed steadily into the animal's eyes after a long pause he continued or do i remain at home to harvest the golden seal mullein and ginseng not to mention an occasional hour with the black bass or tramps for partridge and the dog recognized each word of that before the voice ceased his sleek sides were quivering his nostrils twitching his tail lashing and at the pause he leaped up and thrust his nose against the face of the man the harvester leaned back laughing in deep tones then he patted the dog's head with one hand and renewed his grip with the other good old bel he cried exultantly

to find in what seems a cataclysmal tide of a certain direction a strong drift to the opposite quarter it is so divinable if not so perceptible that its presence may usually be recognized as a beginning of the turn in every tide which is sure sooner or later to come in reform it is the menace of reaction in reaction it is the promise of reform we may take heart as we must lose heart from it a few years ago when a movement which carried fiction to the highest place in literature was apparently of such onward and upward sweep that there could be no return or descent there was a in it which stayed it at last and pulled it back to that lamentable level where fiction is now sunk and the word novel is again the synonym of all that is morally false and mentally despicable yet that this too is partly apparent i think can be shown from some phases of actual fiction which happen to be its very latest phases and which are of a significance as hopeful as it is interesting quite as surely as romanticism lurked at the heart of realism something that we may call psychologism has been present in the romanticism of the last four or five years and has now begun to evolve itself in examples which it is the pleasure as well as the duty of criticism to deal with i no one in his day has done more to popularize the romanticism now decadent than mr gilbert parker and he made way for it at its worst just because he was so much better than it was at its worst because he was a poet of undeniable quality and because he could bring to its intellectual squalor the graces and the powers which charm though they could not avail to save it from final contempt he saves himself in his latest novel because though still so largely romanticistic its prevalent effect is psychologistic which is the finer analogue of realistic and which gave realism whatever was vital in it as now it gives romanticism whatever will survive it in the right of way mr parker is not in a world where mere determinism rules where there is nothing but the happening of things and where this one or that one is important or unimportant according as things are happening to him or not but has in himself no claim upon the reader's attention once more the novel begins to rise to its higher function and to teach that men are somehow masters of their fate his charley steele is indeed as unpromising material for the experiment in certain ways as could well be chosen one of the few memorable things that bulwer said who said so many quotable things was that pure intellectuality is the devil and on his plane charley steele comes near being pure intellectual he apprehends all things from the mind and does the effects even of goodness from the pride of mental strength add to these conditions of his personality that pathologically he is from time to time a drunkard with always the danger of remaining a drunkard and you have a figure of which so much may be despaired that it might almost be called hopeless i confess that in the beginning this brilliant pitiless lawyer this consciencelessly powerful advocate at once mocker and poseur all but failed to interest me a little of him and his monocle went such a great way with me that i thought i had enough of him by the end of the trial where he gets off a man charged with murder and then cruelly snubs the homicide in his gratitude and i do not quite know how i kept on to the point where steele in his drunkenness first dazzles and then insults the gang of drunken lumbermen and begins his second life in the river where they have thrown him and where his former client finds him from that point i could not forsake him to the end though i found myself more than once in the world where things happen of themselves and do not happen from the temperaments of its inhabitants in a better and wiser world the homicide would not perhaps be at hand so opportunely to save the life of the advocate who had saved his but one consents to this as one consents to a great deal besides in the story which is imaginably the survival of a former method the artist's affair is to report the appearance the effect and in the real world the appearance the effect is that of law and not of miracle nature employs the miracle so very sparingly that most of us go through life without seeing one and some of us contract such a prejudice against miracles that when they are performed for us we suspect a trick when i suffered from this suspicion in the right of way i was the more vexed because i felt that i was in the hands of a connoisseur of character who had no need of miracles to sofka have you observed mademoiselle that the painters and sculptors of the middle ages when they placed two figures in adoration one on each side of a fair saint never failed to give them a family likeness when you here see your name among those that are dear to me and under whose auspices i place my works remember that touching harmony and you will see in this not so much an act of homage as an expression of the brotherly affection of your devoted servant de balzac the purse for souls to whom effusiveness is easy there is a delicious hour that falls when it is not yet night but is no longer day the twilight gleam throws softened lights or tricksy reflections on every object and favors a dreamy mood which vaguely weds itself to the play of light and shade the silence which generally prevails at that time makes it particularly dear to artists who grow contemplative stand a few paces back from the pictures on which they can no longer work and pass judgement on them rapt by the subject whose most recondite meaning then flashes on the inner eye of genius he who has never stood pensive by a side in such an hour of poetic dreaming can hardly understand its inexpressible soothingness favored by the the material skill employed by art to produce illusion entirely disappears if the work is a picture the figures represented seem to speak and walk the shade is shadow the light is day the flesh lives eyes move blood flows in their veins and stuffs have a changing sheen imagination helps the realism of every detail and only sees the beauties of the work at that hour illusion reigns despotically perhaps it wakes at nightfall is not illusion a sort of night to the mind which we people with dreams illusion then unfolds its wings it bears the soul aloft to the world of fancies a world full of voluptuous imaginings where the artist forgets the real world yesterday and the morrow the future everything down to its miseries the good and the evil alike at this magic hour a young painter a man of talent who saw in art nothing but art itself was perched on a which helped him to work at a large high painting now nearly finished criticising himself honestly admiring himself floating on the current of his thoughts he then lost himself in one of those meditative moods which ravish and elevate the soul soothe it and comfort it his reverie had no doubt lasted a long time night fell whether he meant to come down from his perch or whether he made some movement believing himself to be on the floor the event did not allow of his remembering exactly the cause of his accident he fell his head struck a footstool he lost consciousness and lay motionless during a space of time of which he knew not the length a sweet voice roused him from the stunned condition into which he had sunk when he opened his eyes the flash of a bright light made him close them again immediately but through the mist that veiled his senses he heard the whispering of two women and felt two young two timid hands on which his head was resting he soon recovered consciousness and by the light of an argand lamp he could make out the most charming face he had ever seen one of those heads which are often supposed to be a freak of the brush but which to him suddenly realized the theories of the ideal beauty which every artist creates for himself and whence his art proceeds the features of the unknown belonged so to say to the refined and delicate type of school but had also the poetic sentiment which girodet gave to the inventions of his phantasy the freshness of the temples the regular arch of the eyebrows the purity of outline the virginal innocence so plainly stamped on every feature of her countenance made the girl a perfect creature her figure was slight and graceful and frail in form her dress though simple and neat revealed neither wealth nor penury as he recovered his senses the painter gave expression to his admiration by a look of surprise and stammered some confused thanks he found a handkerchief pressed to his forehead and above the smell peculiar to a studio he recognized the strong odor of ether applied no doubt to revive him from his fainting fit finally he saw an old woman looking like a marquise of the old school who held the lamp and was advising the young girl monsieur said the younger woman in reply to one of the questions put by the painter during the few minutes when he was still under the influence of the vagueness that the shock had produced in his ideas my mother and i heard the noise of your fall on the floor and we fancied we heard a groan the silence following on the crash alarmed us and we hurried up finding the key in the latch we happily took the liberty of entering and we found you lying motionless on the ground my mother went to fetch what was needed to bathe your head and revive you you have cut your forehead there do you feel it batard batard was a devil this was recognized throughout the northland hell's spawn he was called by many men but his master black leclere chose for him the shameful name batard now black leclere was also a devil and the twain were well matched there is a saying that when two devils come together hell is to pay this is to be expected and this certainly was to be expected when batard and black leclere came together the first time they met batard was a puppy lean and hungry with bitter eyes and they met with snap and snarl and wicked looks for leclere's upper lip had a wolfish way of lifting and showing the white cruel teeth and it lifted then and his eyes glinted viciously as he reached for batard and dragged him out from the squirming litter it was certain that they divined each other for on the instant batard had buried his puppy fangs in leclere's hand and leclere thumb and finger was coolly choking his young life out of him sacredam the frenchman said softly flirting the quick blood from his bitten hand and gazing down on the little puppy choking and gasping in the snow leclere turned to john hamlin storekeeper of the sixty mile post dat fo w'at ah lak heem ow moch eh you m'sieu ow moch ah buy heem now ah buy heem queek and because he hated him with an exceeding bitter hate leclere bought batard and gave him his shameful name and for five years the twain adventured across the northland from st michael's and the yukon delta to the of the pelly and even so far as the peace river athabasca and the great slave and they acquired a reputation for uncompromising wickedness the like of which never before attached itself to man and dog batard did not know his father hence his name but as john hamlin knew his father was a great grey timber wolf but the mother of batard as he dimly remembered her was snarling bickering obscene husky and with a malign eye a grip on life and a genius for trickery and evil there was neither faith nor trust in her her treachery alone could be relied upon and her amours attested her general depravity much of evil and much of strength were there in these batard's progenitors and bone and flesh of their bone and flesh he had inherited it all and then came black leclere to lay his heavy hand on the bit of pulsating puppy life to press and prod and mould till it became a big bristling beast acute in knavery overspilling with hate sinister malignant diabolical with a proper master batard might have made an ordinary fairly efficient he never got the chance leclere but confirmed him in his congenital iniquity the history of batard and leclere is a history of war of five cruel relentless years of which their first meeting is fit summary to begin with it was leclere's fault for he hated with understanding and intelligence while the ungainly puppy hated only blindly instinctively without reason or method at first there were no refinements of cruelty these were to come later but simple beatings and crude brutalities in one of these batard had an ear injured he never regained control of the riven muscles and ever after the ear drooped limply down to keep keen the memory of his tormentor and he never forgot his puppyhood was a period of foolish rebellion he was always worsted but he fought back because it was his nature to fight back and he was unconquerable yelping shrilly from the pain of lash and club he none the less contrived always to throw in the defiant snarl the bitter vindictive menace of his soul which fetched without fail more blows and beatings but his was his mother's tenacious grip on life nothing could kill him he flourished under misfortune grew fat with famine and out of his terrible struggle for life developed a preternatural intelligence his were the stealth and cunning of the husky his mother and the fierceness and valour of the wolf his father possibly it was because of his father that he never wailed his puppy yelps passed with his lanky legs so that he became grim and taciturn quick to strike slow to warn he answered curse with snarl and blow with snap grinning the while his implacable hatred but never again under the extremest agony did leclere bring from him the cry of fear nor of pain this unconquerableness but fanned leclere's wrath and stirred him to greater deviltries did leclere give batard half a fish and to his mates whole ones batard went forth to rob other dogs of their fish also he robbed caches and expressed himself in a thousand rogueries till he became a terror to all dogs and masters of dogs did leclere beat batard and fondle babette babette who was not half the worker he was why batard threw her down in the snow and broke her hind leg in his heavy jaws so that leclere was forced to shoot her likewise in bloody battles batard mastered all his set them the law of trail and forage and made them live to the law he set

conquered the postmen and delivered to me its imperious commands insisted that trot and cap'n bill be admitted to the land of oz where trot could enjoy the society of dorothy betsy bobbin and ozma while the might become a comrade of the tin woodman the shaggy man and all the other quaint people who inhabit this wonderful fairyland it was no easy task to obey this order and land trot and cap'n bill safely in oz as you will discover by reading this book indeed it required the best efforts of our dear old friend the scarecrow to save them from a dreadful fate on the journey but the story leaves them happily located in ozma's splendid palace and dorothy has promised me that and the three girls are sure to encounter in the near future some marvelous adventures in the land of oz which i hope to be permitted to relate to you in the next oz book meantime i am deeply grateful to my little readers for their continued enthusiasm over the oz stories as evinced in the many letters they send me all of which are lovingly cherished it takes more and more oz books every year to satisfy the demands of old and new readers and there have been formed many oz reading societies where the oz books owned by different members are read aloud all this is very gratifying to me and encourages me to write more stories when the children have had enough of them i hope they will let me know and then i'll

across the glassy surface of the sea seems to me that all we learn is jus so much gained i know it looks that way at first sight said the sailor nodding his head but those as knows the least have a

few dips o the oars of knowledge trot didn't answer she was a very little girl with big solemn eyes and an earnest simple manner cap'n bill had been her faithful companion for years and had taught her almost everything she knew he was a wonderful man this cap'n bill not so very old although his hair was grizzled what there was of it most of his head was bald as an egg and as shiny as oilcloth and this made his big ears stick out in a funny way his eyes had a gentle look and were pale blue in color and his round face was rugged and bronzed cap'n bill's left leg was missing from the knee down and that was why the sailor no longer sailed the seas the wooden leg he wore was good enough to stump around with on land or even to take trot out for a row or a sail on the ocean but when it came to runnin up aloft or performing active duties on shipboard the old sailor was not equal to the task the loss of his leg had ruined his career and the old sailor found comfort in devoting himself to the education and companionship of the little girl chapter ii his friend the editor turned to him squarely willie took me into consultation and since he seems to have let you in i may just as well tell you what is up i shall try to be as short as i can but in confidence mind he waited renouard his uneasiness growing on him unreasonably assented by a nod and the other lost no time in beginning professor moorsom physicist and philosopher fine head of white hair to judge from the photographs plenty of brains in the head too all these famous books surely even renouard would know renouard muttered moodily that it his sort of reading and his friend hastened to assure him earnestly that neither was it his sort except as a matter of business and duty for the literary page of that newspaper which was his property and the pride of his life the only literary newspaper in the antipodes could not ignore the fashionable philosopher of the age not that anybody read moorsom at the antipodes but everybody had heard of him women children dock labourers cabmen the only person besides himself who had read moorsom as far as he knew was old dunster who used to call himself a moorsomian or was it moorsomite years and years ago long before moorsom had worked himself up into the great swell he was now in every way socially too quite the fashion in the highest world renouard listened with profoundly concealed attention a charlatan he muttered languidly well no i should say not i wonder though if most of his writing had been done with his tongue in his cheek of course to be expected i tell you what the only really honest writing is to be found in newspapers and nowhere else and you forget it the editor paused with a basilisk stare till renouard had conceded a casual i dare say and only then went on to explain that old dunster during his european tour had been made rather a lion of in london where he stayed with the moorsoms he meant the father and the girl the professor had been a widower for a long time she look just a girl muttered renouard the other agreed very likely not had been playing the london hostess to people ever since she put her hair up probably i expect to see any girlish bloom on her when i do have the privilege he continued those people are staying with the incog in a manner you understand something like royalties they deceive anybody but they want to be left to themselves we have even kept them out of the paper to oblige old dunster but we shall put your arrival in our local celebrity heavens yes mr g renouard the explorer whose indomitable energy etc and who is now working for the prosperity of our country in another way on his malata plantation and by the by the silk plant flourishing yes did you bring any fibre i see to be transhipped to liverpool for experimental manufacture eh eminent capitalists at home very much interested they they are a silence fell then the editor uttered slowly you will be a rich man some day face did not betray his opinion of that confident prophecy he say anything till his friend suggested in the same meditative voice you ought to interest moorsom in the affair too since willie has let you in a philosopher i suppose he above making a bit of money and he may be clever at it for all you know i have a notion that a fairly practical old cove anyhow and here the tone of the speaker took on a tinge of respect he has made philosophy pay renouard raised his eyes repressed an impulse to jump up and got out of the slowly it perhaps a bad idea he said have to call there in any case he wondered whether he had managed to keep his voice steady its tone unconcerned enough for his emotion was strong though it had nothing to do with the business aspect of this suggestion he moved in the room in vague preparation for departure when he heard a soft laugh he spun about quickly with a frown but the editor was not laughing at him he was chuckling across the big desk at the wall a preliminary of some speech for which renouard recalled to himself waited silent and mistrustful no you would never guess no one would ever guess what these people are after eyes bulged out when he came to me with the tale they always do remarked renouard with disgust stupid he was startled and so was i after he told me a search party they are out looking for a man soft enlisted in the cause renouard repeated looking for a man he sat down suddenly as if on purpose to stare did willie come to you to borrow the lantern he asked sarcastically and got up again for no apparent reason what lantern snapped the puzzled editor and his face darkened with suspicion you renouard are always alluding to things that clear to me if you were in politics i as a party journalist trust you further than i could see you not an inch further you are such a sophisticated beggar listen the man is the man miss moorsom was engaged to for a year he have been a nobody anyhow but he seem to have been very wise hard luck for the young lady viii this time of levi west's unwelcome visitation was indeed a time of bitter trouble and tribulation to poor hiram white money was of very different value in those days than it is now and five hundred pounds was in its way a good round lump in sussex county it was almost a fortune it was a desperate struggle for hiram to raise the amount of his father's bequest to his stepbrother squire hall as may have been gathered had a very warm and friendly feeling for hiram believing in him when all others disbelieved nevertheless in the matter of money the old man was as hard and as cold as adamant he would he said do all he could to help hiram but that five hundred pounds must and should be raised hiram must release his security bond he would loan him he said three hundred pounds taking a mortgage upon the mill he would have lent him four hundred but that there was already a first mortgage of one hundred pounds upon it and he would not dare to put more than three hundred more atop of that hiram had a considerable quantity of wheat which he had bought upon speculation and which was then lying idle in a philadelphia storehouse this he had sold at public sale and at a very great sacrifice he realized barely one hundred pounds upon it the financial horizon looked very black to him nevertheless levi's five hundred pounds was raised and paid into squire hall's hands and squire hall released hiram's bond the business was finally closed on one cold gray afternoon in the early part of december as hiram tore his bond across and then tore it across again and again squire hall pushed back the papers upon his desk and cocked his feet upon its slanting top hiram said he abruptly hiram do you know that levi west is forever hanging around billy martin's house after that pretty daughter of his so long a space of silence followed the speech that the squire began to think that hiram might not have heard him but hiram had heard no said he i didn't know it well he is said squire hall it's the talk of the whole neighborhood the talk's pretty bad too d'ye know that they say that she was away from home three days last week nobody knew where the fellow's turned her head with his sailor's yarns and his traveler's lies hiram said not a word but he sat looking at the other in stolid silence that stepbrother of yours continued the old squire presently is a rascal he is a rascal hiram and i he's something worse i hear he's been seen in some queer places and with queer company of late he stopped again and still hiram said nothing and look'ee hiram the old man resumed suddenly i do hear that you be courtin the girl too is that so yes said hiram i'm courtin her too tut tut said the squire that's a pity hiram i'm afraid your cakes are dough after he had left the squire's office hiram stood for a while in the street bareheaded his hat in his hand staring unwinkingly down at the ground at his feet with stupidly drooping lips and lackluster eyes presently he raised his hand and began slowly smoothing down the sandy shock of hair upon his forehead at last he aroused himself with a shake looked dully up and down the street and then putting on his hat turned and walked slowly and heavily away the early dusk of the cloudy winter evening was settling fast for the sky was leaden and threatening at the outskirts of the town hiram stopped again and again stood for a while in brooding thought then finally he turned slowly not the way that led homeward but taking the road that led between the bare and withered fields and crooked fences toward billy martin's it would be hard to say just what it was that led hiram to seek billy martin's house at that time of day whether it was fate or ill fortune he could not have chosen a more opportune time to confirm his own undoing what he saw was the very worst that his heart feared along the road at a little distance from the house was a hedge now bare naked leafless as hiram drew near he heard footsteps approaching and low voices he drew back into the fence corner and there stood half sheltered by the stark network of twigs two figures passed slowly along the gray of the roadway in the gloaming one was his stepbrother the other was sally martin levi's arm was around her he was whispering into her ear and her head rested upon his shoulder hiram stood as still as breathless as cold as ice they stopped upon the side of the road just beyond where he stood hiram's eyes never left them there for some time they talked together in low voices their words now and then reaching the ears of that silent breathless listener suddenly there came the clattering of an opening door and then betty martin's voice broke the silence harshly shrilly sal sal sally martin you sally martin come in yere where be ye chapter ii good indian there is a saying and if it is not purely western it is at least purely american that the only good indian is a dead indian in the very teeth of that and in spite of the fact that he was neither very good nor an indian nor in any sense dead men called grant imsen good indian to his face and if he resented the title his resentment was never made manifest perhaps because he had grown up with the name he rather liked it when he was a little fellow and with custom had come to take it as a matter of course because his paternal ancestry went back and back to no one knows where among the race of blue eyes and fair skin the indians repudiated relationship with him and called him white man though they also spoke of him unthinkingly as good injun because old wolfbelly himself would grudgingly admit under pressure that the mother of grant had been the daughter of wolfbelly's sister white men remembered the taint when they were angry and called him injun and because he stood thus between the two races of men his exact social status a subject always open to argument not even the fact that he was looked upon by the harts as one of the family with his own bed always ready for him in a corner of the big room set apart for the boys and with a certain place at the table which was called his not even his assured position there could keep him from sometimes feeling quite alone and perhaps a trifle bitter over his loneliness phoebe hart had mothered him from the time when his father had sickened and died in her house leaving grant there with twelve years behind him in his hands a dirty canvas bag of gold coin so heavy he could scarce lift it which stood for the mining claim the old man had just sold and the command to invest every one of the gold coins in schooling old john imsen was steeped in knowledge of the open nothing of the great outdoors had ever slipped past him and remained mysterious put when he sold his last claim others he had which promised little and so did not count he had signed his name with an x another had written the word john before that x and the word imsen after above a word which he explained was his and below the word mark john imsen had stared down suspiciously at the words and he had not felt quite easy in his mind until the bag of gold coins was actually in his keeping also he had been ashamed of that x it was a simple thing to make with a pen and yet he had only succeeded in making it look like two crooked sticks thrown down carelessly one upon the other his face had gone darkly red with the shame of it and he had stood scowling down at the paper that boy uh mine's goin to do better n that by god he had sworn and the words had sounded like a vow when two months after that he had faced incredulously as is the way with strong men the fact that for him life was over with nothing left to him save an hour or so of labored breath and a few muttered sentences he did not forget that vow he called phoebe close to the bed placed the bag of gold in grant's trembling hands and stared intently from one face to the other mis hart he ain't got anybody my folks i lost track of em years ago you see to it git some learnin in his head when a man knows books it's like bein heeled good gun plenty uh in a fight when i got that gold it was like fightin with my bare hands against a gatlin gun they coulda cheated me whole thing on paper i wouldn't know luck just luck they didn't so you take it and git the boy schoolin costs money i know that git him all it'll buy send him where they keep the best don't yuh let up n'er let him whilst they's a dollar left put it all into his head then he can't lose it and he can make it earn more i guess i needn't ask yuh be good to him he ain't got anybody not a soul injuns don't count you see to it don't let up till it's all gone phoebe had taken him literally and grant if he had little taste for the task had learned books and other things not mentioned in the curriculums of the schools she sent him to and when the bag was reported by phoebe to be empty he had returned with inward relief to the desultory life of the hart ranch and its immediate vicinity his father would probably have been amazed to see how little difference that schooling made in the boy the money had lasted long enough to take him through a preparatory school and into the second year of a college and the only result apparent was speech a shade less slipshod than that of his fellows and a vocabulary which permitted him to indulge in an amazing number of epithets and in colorful vituperation when the fancy seized him he rode hot and thirsty and tired from sage hill one day and found hartley empty of interest hot as the trail he had just now left thankfully behind him and so absolutely sleepy that it seemed likely to sink into the earth under the weight of its own dullness even the whisky was so warm it burned like fire and the beer he tried left upon his outraged palate the unhappy memory of insipid warmth and great bitterness the telescope of the rocky mountains on the of october in the preceding year after the close of the subscription the president of the gun club had credited the observatory of cambridge with the necessary sums for the construction of a gigantic optical instrument this instrument was designed for the purpose of rendering visible on the surface of the moon any object exceeding nine feet in diameter at the period when the gun club essayed their great experiment such instruments had reached a high degree of perfection and produced some magnificent results two telescopes in particular at this time were possessed of remarkable power and of gigantic dimensions the first constructed by herschel was feet in length and had an of four feet six inches it possessed a magnifying power of the second was raised in ireland in parsonstown park and belongs to lord rosse the length of this tube is feet and the diameter of its six feet it magnifies times and required an immense erection of brick work and masonry for the purpose of working it its weight being twelve and a half tons still despite these colossal dimensions the actual enlargements scarcely exceeded times in round numbers consequently the moon was brought within no nearer an apparent distance than miles and objects of less than sixty feet in diameter unless they were of very considerable length were still imperceptible in the present case dealing with a projectile nine feet in diameter and fifteen feet long it became necessary to bring the moon within an apparent distance of five miles at most and for that purpose to establish a magnifying power of times such was the question proposed to the observatory of cambridge there was no lack of funds the difficulty was purely one of construction after considerable discussion as to the best form and principle of the proposed instrument the work was finally commenced according to the calculations of the observatory of cambridge the tube of the new reflector would require to be feet in length and the sixteen feet in diameter colossal as these dimensions may appear they were diminutive in comparison with the foot telescope proposed by the astronomer hooke only a few years ago regarding the choice of locality that matter was promptly determined the object was to select some lofty mountain and there are not many of these in the united states in fact there are but two chains of moderate elevation between which runs the magnificent mississippi the king of rivers as these republican yankees delight to call it eastwards rise the appalachians the very highest point of which in new hampshire does not exceed the very moderate altitude of feet on the west however rise the rocky mountains that immense range which commencing at the straights of magellan follows the western coast of southern america under the name of the andes or the cordilleras until it crosses the isthmus of panama and runs up the whole of north america to the very borders of the polar sea the highest elevation of this range still does not exceed feet with this elevation nevertheless the gun club were compelled to be content inasmuch as they had determined that both telescope and columbiad should be erected within the limits of the union all the necessary apparatus was consequently sent on to the summit of long's peak in the territory of missouri neither pen nor language can describe the difficulties of all kinds which the american engineers had to surmount of the prodigies of daring and skill which they accomplished they had to raise enormous stones massive pieces of wrought iron heavy and huge portions of cylinder with an weighing nearly pounds above the line of perpetual snow for more than feet in height after crossing desert prairies impenetrable forests fearful rapids far from all centers of population and in the midst of savage regions in which every detail of life becomes an almost insoluble problem and yet notwithstanding these innumerable obstacles american genius triumphed in less than a year after the commencement of the works toward the close of september the gigantic reflector rose into the air to a height of feet it was raised by means of an enormous iron crane an ingenious mechanism allowed it to be easily worked toward all the points of the heavens and to follow the stars from the one horizon to the other during their journey through the heavens it had cost the first time it was directed toward the moon the observers evinced both curiosity and anxiety what were they about to discover in the field of this telescope which magnified objects times would they perceive peoples herds of lunar animals towns lakes seas no there was nothing which science had not already discovered and on all the points of its disc the volcanic nature of the moon became determinable with the utmost precision but the telescope of the rocky mountains before doing its duty to the gun club rendered immense services to astronomy thanks to its penetrative power the depths of the heavens were sounded to the utmost extent the apparent diameter of a great number of stars was accurately measured and mr clark of the cambridge staff resolved the crab nebula in taurus which the reflector of lord rosse had never been able to decompose contents chapter the first the

said was inaudible behind him the little rufous man with the big eyes twitched at his robe and offered suggestions and behind these two clustered a great multitude of heated excited swarthy faces the emperor sat on his golden throne in the midst of the gathering commanding silence by gestures speaking inaudibly to them in a tongue the majority did not use and then prevailing they ceased their interruptions and the old man arius took up the debate for a time all those impassioned faces were intent upon him they listened as though they sought occasion and suddenly as if by a preconcerted arrangement they were all thrusting their fingers into their ears and knitting their brows in assumed horror some were crying aloud and making as if to fly some indeed tucked up their garments and fled they spread out into a pattern they were like the little monks who run from st jerome's lion in the picture by carpaccio then one zealot rushed forward and smote the old man heavily upon the mouth the hall seemed to grow vaster and vaster the disputing infuriated figures multiplied to an innumerable assembly they drove about like snowflakes in a gale they whirled in argumentative couples they spun in eddies of contradiction they made extraordinary patterns and then amidst the cloudy darkness of the unfathomable dome above them there appeared and increased a radiant triangle in which shone an eye the eye and the triangle filled the heavens sent out flickering rays glowed to a blinding incandescence seemed to be speaking words of thunder that were nevertheless inaudible it was as if that thunder filled the heavens it was as if it were nothing but the beating artery in the sleeper's ear the attention strained to hear and comprehend and on the very verge of comprehension snapped like a nicoea the word remained like a little ash after a flare the sleeper had awakened and lay very still oppressed by a sense of intellectual effort that had survived the dream in which it had arisen was it so that things had happened the mind moving obscurely could not determine whether it was so or not had they indeed behaved in this manner when the great mystery was established who said they stopped their ears with their fingers and fled shouting with horror shouting was it eusebius or athanasius or sozomen some letter or apology by athanasius and surely it was impossible that the trinity could have appeared visibly as a triangle and an eye above such an assembly that was mere dreaming of course was it dreaming after raphael after raphael the drowsy mind wandered into a side issue was the picture that had suggested this dream the one in the vatican where all the fathers of the church are shown disputing together but there surely god and the son themselves were painted with a symbol some symbol also but was that disputation about the trinity at all wasn't it rather about a chalice and a dove of course it was a chalice and a dove then where did one see the triangle and the eye and men disputing some such picture there was what a lot of disputing there had been what endless disputing which had gone on until last night when this very disagreeable young man with the hawk nose and the pointing finger had tackled one when one was sorely fagged and disputed disputed rebuked and disputed answer me this he had said and still one's poor brains disputed and would not rest about the trinity the brain upon the pillow was now wearily awake it was at once hopelessly awake and active and hopelessly unprogressive it was like some floating stick that had got caught in an eddy in a river going round and round and round and round eternally eternally eternally begotten but what possible meaning do you attach then to such a phrase as eternally begotten the brain upon the pillow stared hopelessly at this question without an answer without an escape the three repetitions spun round and round became a swiftly revolving triangle like some electric sign that had got beyond control in the midst of which stared an unwinking and resentful eye every one knows that expedient of the sleepless the counting of sheep you lie quite still you breathe regularly you imagine sheep jumping over a gate one after another you count them quietly and slowly until you count yourself off through a fading string of phantom numbers to number nod but sheep alas suggest an episcopal crook the magic egg the pretty little theatre attached to the building of the unicorn club had been hired for a certain january afternoon by mr herbert loring who wished to give therein a somewhat novel performance to which he had invited a small audience consisting entirely of friends and acquaintances loring was a handsome fellow about thirty years old who had travelled far and studied much he had recently made a long sojourn in the far east and his friends had been invited to the theatre to see some of the wonderful things he had brought from that country of wonders as loring was a and belonged to a family of good social standing his circle of acquaintances was large and in this circle a good many unpleasant remarks had been made regarding the proposed entertainment made of course by the people who had not been invited to be present some of the gossip on the subject had reached loring who did not hesitate to say that he could not talk to a crowd and that he did not care to show the curious things he had collected to people who would not thoroughly appreciate them he had been very particular in regard to his invitations at three o'clock on the appointed afternoon nearly all the people who had been invited to the unicorn theatre were in their seats no one had stayed away except for some very good reason for it was well known that if herbert loring offered to show anything it was worth seeing about forty people were present who sat talking to one another or admiring the decoration of the theatre as loring stood upon the stage where he was entirely alone his exhibition requiring no assistants he gazed through a loophole in the curtain upon a very interesting array of faces there were the faces of many men and women of society of students of workers in various fields of thought and even of idlers in all fields of thought but there was not one which indicated a frivolous or listless disposition the owners of those faces had come to see something and they wished to see it for a quarter of an hour after the time announced for the opening of the exhibition loring peered through the hole in the curtain and then although all the people he had expected had not arrived he felt it would not do for him to wait any longer the audience was composed of and courteous men and women but despite their polite loring could see that some of them were getting tired of waiting so very reluctantly and feeling that further delay was impossible he raised the curtain and came forward on the stage briefly he announced that the exhibition would open with some fireworks he had brought from corea it was plain to see that the statement that fireworks were about to be set off on a theatre stage by an amateur had rather startled some of the audience and loring hastened to explain that these were not real fireworks but that they were contrivances made of colored glass which were illuminated by the powerful lens of a lantern which was placed out of sight and while the apparent pyrotechnic display would resemble fireworks of strange and grotesque designs it would be absolutely without danger he brought out some little bunches of bits of colored glass hung them at some distance apart on a wire which was stretched across the stage just high enough for him to reach it and then lighted his lantern which he placed in one of the wings lowered all the lights in the theatre and began his exhibition as loring turned his lantern on one of the clusters of glass lenses strips and points and unseen himself caused them to move by means of long cords attached the effects were beautiful and marvellous little wheels of colored fire rapidly revolved miniature rockets appeared to rise a few feet and to explode in the air and while all the ordinary forms of fireworks were produced on a diminutive scale there were some effects that were entirely novel to the audience as the light was turned successively upon one and another of the clusters of glass sometimes it would flash along the whole line so rapidly that all the various combinations of color and motion seemed to be combined in one and then for a time each particular set of fireworks would blaze sparkle and coruscate by itself scattering particles of colored light as if they had been real sparks of fire this curious and beautiful exhibition of miniature pyrotechnics was extremely interesting to the audience who gazed upward with rapt and eager attention at the line of wheels stars and revolving spheres so far as interest gave evidence of satisfaction there was never a better satisfied audience at first there had been some hushed murmurs of pleasure but very soon the attention of every one seemed so completely engrossed by the dazzling display that they simply gazed in silence for twenty minutes or longer the glittering show went on and not a sign of weariness or inattention was made by any one of the assembled company then gradually the colors of the little fireworks faded the stars and wheels revolved more slowly the lights in the body of the theatre were gradually raised and the stage curtain went softly down the pot of gold mary had not been in the dolan home an hour until katy knew all she could tell of her trouble mrs dolan was practical go to see father michael she said what's he for but to hilp us go ask him what jimmy told him till him how you feel and what you know he can till you what dannie knows and thin you will understand where you are at mary was on the way before mrs dolan fully finished she went to the priest's residence and asked his housekeeper to inquire if he would see her he would and mary entered his presence strangely calm and this was the last fight she knew of that she could make for happiness and if she lost happiness was over for her she had need of all her wit and she knew it father michael began laughing as he shook hands now look here mary he said i've been expecting you i warn you before you begin that i cannot sanction your marriage to a protestant oh but i'm going to convart him cried mary so quickly that the priest laughed harder than ever so that's the lay of the land he chuckled well if you'll guarantee that i'll give in when shall i read the banns not until we get dannie's consint answered mary and for the first her voice wavered father michael looked his surprise tut tut he said and is dannie dilatory dannie is the finest man that will ever live in this world said mary but he don't want to marry me to my certain knowledge dannie has loved you all your life said father michael he wants nothing here or hereafter as he wants to marry you thin why don't he till me so sobbed mary burying her burning face in her hands has he said nothing to you gravely inquired the priest no he hasn't and i don't belave he intinds to answered mary wiping her eyes and trying to be composed there is something about jimmy that is holding him back mrs dolan thought you'd help me what do you want me to do mary asked father michael two things answered mary promptly i want you to tell me what jimmy confissed to you before he died and then i want you to talk to dannie and show him that he is free from any promise that jimmy might have got out of him will you a dying confession began the priest yes but i know broke in mary i saw them fight and i heard jimmy till dannie that he'd lied to him to separate us but he turned right around and took it back and i knew dannie belaved him thin but he can't after jimmy confissed it again to both of you what do you mean by saw them fight father michael was leaning toward mary anxiously mary told him then that is the explanation to the whole thing said the priest dannie did believe jimmy when he took it back and he died before he could repeat to dannie what he had told me and i have had the feeling that dannie thought himself in a way to blame for jimmy's death he was not oh he was not cried mary malone didn't i live there with them all those years dannie always was good as gold to jimmy it was shameful the way jimmy imposed on him and spint his money and took me from him it was shameful shameful be calm be calm cautioned father michael i agree with you i am only trying to arrive at dannie's point of view he well might feel that he was responsible if after humoring jimmy like a child all his life he at last lost his temper and dealt with him as if he were a man if that is the case he is of honor so fine that he would hesitate to speak to you no matter what he suffered and then it is clear to me that he does not understand how jimmy separated you in the first place and lied me into marrying him whin i told him over and over how i loved dannie jimmy malone took iverything i had to give and he left me alone for fiftane years with my three little dead babies that died because i'd no heart to desire life for thim and he took my youth and he took my womanhood and he took my man mary arose in primitive rage you naden't bother she said i'm going straight to dannie meself don't said father michael softly don't do that mary it isn't the accepted way there is a better let him come to you but he won't come he don't know he's in jimmy's grip tighter in death than he was in life mary began to sob again he will come said father michael be calm wait a little my child after all these years don't spoil a love that has been almost unequaled in holiness and beauty by anger at the dead let me go to dannie we are good friends i can tell him jimmy made a confession to me that he was trying to repeat to him when punishment far more awful than anything you have suffered overtook him always remember mary he died unshriven mary began to shiver your suffering is over continued the priest you have many good years yet that you may spend with dannie god will give you living children i am sure think of the years jimmy's secret has hounded and driven him think of the penalty he must pay before he gets a glimpse of paradise if he be not eternally lost submerged the chamber which was destined to be the scene of our unforgettable experience was a charmingly feminine some fourteen or sixteen feet square at the end of it divided by a curtain of red velvet was a small apartment which formed the professor's this in turn opened into a large bedroom the curtain was still hanging but the boudoir and could be taken as one chamber for the purposes of our experiment one door and the window frame had been plastered round with varnished paper so as to be practically sealed above the other door which opened on to the landing there hung a fanlight which could be drawn by a cord when some ventilation became absolutely necessary a large shrub in a tub stood in each corner how to get rid of our excessive carbon dioxide without unduly wasting our oxygen is a delicate and vital question said challenger looking round him after the five iron tubes had been laid side by side against the wall with longer time for preparation i could have brought the whole concentrated force of my intelligence to bear more fully upon the problem but as it is we must do what we can the shrubs will be of some small service two of the oxygen tubes are ready to be turned on at an instant's notice so that we cannot be taken unawares at the same time it would be well not to go far from the room as the crisis may be a sudden and urgent one there was a broad low window opening out upon a balcony the view beyond was the same as that which we had already admired from the study looking out i could see no sign of disorder anywhere there was a road curving down the side of the hill under my very eyes a cab from the station one of those prehistoric survivals which are only to be found in our country villages was toiling slowly up the hill lower down was a nurse girl wheeling a perambulator and leading a second child by the hand the blue reeks of smoke from the cottages gave the whole widespread landscape an air of settled order and homely comfort nowhere in the blue heaven or on the sunlit earth was there any foreshadowing of a catastrophe the harvesters were back in the fields once more and the golfers in pairs and fours were still streaming round the links there was so strange a turmoil within my own head and such a jangling of my overstrung nerves that the indifference of those people was amazing those fellows don't seem to feel any ill effects said i pointing down at the links have you played golf asked lord john no i have not well young fellah when you do you'll learn that once fairly out on a round it would take the crack of doom to stop a true golfer halloa there's that again from time to time during and after lunch the high insistent ring had summoned the professor he gave us the news as it came through to him in a few curt sentences such terrific items had never been registered in the world's history before the great shadow was creeping up from the south like a rising tide of death egypt had gone through its delirium and was now comatose spain and portugal after a wild frenzy in which the clericals and the anarchists had fought most desperately were now fallen silent no cable messages were received any longer from south america in north america the southern states after some terrible racial rioting had succumbed to the poison north of maryland the effect was not yet marked and in canada it was hardly perceptible belgium holland and denmark had each in turn been affected despairing messages were flashing from every quarter to the great centres of learning to the chemists and the doctors of repute imploring their advice the astronomers too were deluged with inquiries nothing could be done the thing was universal and beyond our human knowledge or control it was death painless but inevitable death for young and old for weak and strong for rich and poor without hope or possibility of escape such was the news which in scattered distracted messages the telephone had brought us the great cities already knew their fate and so far as we could gather were preparing to meet it with dignity and resignation yet here were our golfers and laborers like the lambs who gambol under the shadow of the knife it seemed amazing and yet how could they know it had all come upon us in one giant stride what was there in the morning paper to alarm them and now it was but three in the afternoon even as we looked some rumour seemed to have spread for we saw the reapers hurrying from the fields some of the golfers were returning to the they were running as if taking refuge from a shower their little caddies trailed behind them others were continuing their game the nurse had turned and was pushing her perambulator hurriedly up the hill again i noticed that she had her hand to her brow the cab had stopped and the tired horse with his head sunk to his knees was resting above there was a perfect summer sky one huge vault of unbroken blue save for a few fleecy white clouds over the distant downs if the human race must die it was at least upon a glorious and yet all that gentle loveliness of nature made this terrific and wholesale destruction the more pitiable and awful surely it was too goodly a residence that we should be so swiftly so ruthlessly evicted from it iii the sofa what young men will do sometimes to ruin themselves and break their friends hearts said sergeant dornton surprising i had a case at saint hospital which was of this sort a bad case indeed with a bad end the secretary and the and the treasurer of saint hospital came to scotland yard to give information of numerous robberies having been committed on the students the students could leave nothing in the pockets of their while the were hanging at the hospital but it was almost certain to be stolen property of various descriptions was constantly being lost and the gentlemen were naturally uneasy about it and anxious for the credit of the institution that the thief or thieves should be discovered the case was entrusted to me and i went to the hospital now gentlemen said i after we had talked it over i understand this property is usually lost from one room yes they said it was i should wish if you please said i to see the room it was a bare room with a few tables and forms in it and a row of pegs all round for hats and coats next gentlemen said i do you suspect anybody yes they said they did suspect somebody they were sorry to say they suspected one of the porters i should like said i to have that man pointed out to me and to have a little time to look after him he was pointed out and i looked after him and then i went back to the hospital and said now gentlemen not the porter unfortunately for himself a little too fond of drink but nothing worse my suspicion is that these robberies are committed by one of the students and if put me a sofa into that room where the pegs are as no closet i think i shall be able to detect the thief i wish the sofa if you please to be covered with chintz or something of that sort so that i may lie on my chest underneath it without being seen the sofa was provided and next day at eleven before any of the students came i went there with those gentlemen to get underneath it it turned out to be one of those sofas with a great at the bottom that would have broken my back in no time if i could ever have got below it we had quite a job to break all this away in the time however i fell to work and they fell to work and we broke it out and made a clear place for me i got under the sofa lay down on my chest took out my knife and made a convenient hole in the chintz to look through it was then settled between me and the gentlemen that when the students were all up in the wards one of the gentlemen should come in and hang up a on one of the pegs and that that should have in one of the pockets a containing marked money after i had been there some time the students began to drop into the room by ones and twos and threes and to talk about all sorts of things little thinking there was anybody under the sofa and then to go at last there came in one who remained until he was alone in the room by himself a tallish young man of one or two and twenty with a light whisker he went to a particular took off a good hat that was hanging there tried it on hung his own hat in its place and hung that hat on another peg nearly opposite to me i then felt quite certain that he was the thief and would come back when they were all the gentleman came in with the i showed him where to hang it so that i might have a good view of it and he went away and i lay under the sofa on my chest for a couple of hours or so waiting at last the same young man came down he walked across the room whistling stopped and listened took another walk and whistled stopped again and listened then began to go regularly round the pegs feeling in the pockets of all the coats when he came to the and felt the he was so eager and so hurried that he broke the strap in tearing it open as he began to put the money in his pocket i crawled out from under the sofa and his eyes met mine picture dective story the sofa my face as you may perceive is brown now but it was pale at that time my health not being good and looked as long as a besides which there was a great draught of air from the door underneath the sofa and i had tied a handkerchief round my head so what i looked like altogether i know he turned blue literally blue when he saw me crawling out and i feel surprised at it chapter x a charming introduction to a hermit's life four weeks torture tossing and sickness oh these bleak winds and bitter northern skies and impassable roads and dilatory country surgeons and oh this dearth of the human physiognomy and worse than all the terrible intimation of kenneth that i need not expect to be out of doors till spring mr heathcliff has just honoured me with a call about seven days ago he sent me a brace of grouse the last of the season scoundrel he is not altogether guiltless in this illness of mine and that i had a great mind to tell him but alas how could i offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts blisters and leeches this is quite an easy interval i am too weak to read yet i feel as if i could enjoy something interesting why not have up mrs dean to finish her tale i can recollect its chief incidents as far as she had gone yes i remember her hero had run off and never been heard of for three years and the heroine was married i'll ring she'll be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully mrs dean came it wants twenty minutes sir to taking the medicine she commenced away away with it i replied i desire to have the doctor says you must drop the powders with all my heart don't interrupt me come and take your seat here keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials draw your knitting out of your pocket that will do now continue the history of mr heathcliff from where you left off to the present day did he finish his education on the continent and come back a gentleman or did he get a sizar's place at college or escape to america and earn honours by drawing blood from his or make a fortune more promptly on the english highways he may have done a little in all these vocations mr lockwood but i couldn't give my word for any i stated before that i didn't know how he gained his money neither am i aware of the means he took to raise his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk but with your leave i'll proceed in my own fashion if you think it will amuse and not weary you are you feeling better this morning much that's good news i got miss catherine and myself to thrushcross grange and to my agreeable disappointment she behaved infinitely better than i dared to expect she seemed almost of mr linton and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection they were both very attentive to her comfort certainly it was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn there were no mutual concessions one stood erect and the others yielded and who can be and when they encounter neither opposition nor indifference i observed that mr edgar had a fear of ruffling her humour he concealed it from her but if ever he heard me answer sharply or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious order of hers he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account he many a time spoke sternly to me about my pertness and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed not to grieve a kind master i learned to be less touchy and for the space of half a year the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand because no fire came near to explode it catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then they were respected with sympathising silence by her husband who ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution produced by her perilous illness as she was never subject to depression of spirits before the return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from him i believe i may assert that they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness it ended well we must be for ourselves in the long run the mild and generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering and it ended when circumstances caused each to feel that the one's interest was not the chief consideration in the other's thoughts on a mellow evening in september i was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples which i had been gathering it had got dusk and the moon looked over the high wall of the court causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building i set my burden on the by the and lingered to rest and drew in a few more breaths of the soft sweet air my eyes were on the moon and my back to the entrance when i heard a voice behind me say is that you it was a deep voice and foreign in tone yet there was something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar i turned about to discover who spoke fearfully for the doors were shut and i had seen nobody on approaching the steps something stirred in the porch and moving nearer i distinguished a tall man dressed in dark clothes with dark face and hair he leant against the side and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself who can it be i thought mr earnshaw oh no the voice has no resemblance to his the devil in manuscript on a bitter evening of december i arrived by mail in a large town which was then the residence of an intimate friend one of those gifted youths who cultivate poetry and the and call themselves students at law my first business after supper was to visit him at the office of his distinguished instructor as i have said it was a bitter night clear starlight but cold as nova zembla the along the street being frosted so as almost to hide the lights while the wheels of coaches thundered equally loud over frozen earth and pavements of stone there was no snow either on the ground or the roofs of the houses the wind blew so violently that i had but to spread my cloak like a and scud along the street at the rate of ten knots greatly envied by other navigators who were beating slowly up with the gale right in their teeth one of these i capsized but was gone on the wings of the wind before he could even vociferate an oath after this picture of an inclement night behold us seated by a great blazing fire which looked so comfortable and delicious that i felt inclined to lie down and roll among the hot coals the usual furniture of a lawyer's office was around us rows of volumes in sheepskin and a multitude of writs summonses and other legal papers scattered over the desks and tables but there were certain objects which seemed to intimate that we had little dread of the intrusion of clients or of the learned counsellor himself who indeed was attending court in a distant town a tall bottle stood on the table between two tumblers and beside a pile of blotted manuscripts altogether dissimilar to any law documents recognized in our courts my friend whom i shall call oberon it was a name of fancy and friendship between him and me my friend oberon looked at these papers with a peculiar expression of disquietude i do believe said he soberly or at least i could believe if i chose that there is a devil in this pile of blotted papers you have read them and know what i mean that conception in which i endeavored to embody the character of a fiend as represented in our traditions and the written records of witchcraft oh i have a horror of what was created in my own brain and shudder at the manuscripts in which i gave that dark idea a sort of material existence would they were out of my sight and of mine too thought i you remember continued oberon how the hellish thing used to suck away the happiness of those who by a simple concession that seemed almost innocent subjected themselves to his power just so my peace is gone and all by these accursed manuscripts have you felt nothing of the same influence nothing replied i unless the spell be hid in a desire to turn novelist after reading your delightful tales novelist exclaimed oberon half seriously then indeed my devil has his claw on you you are gone you cannot even pray for deliverance but we will be the last and only victims for this night i mean to burn the manuscripts and commit the fiend to his retribution in the flames burn your tales repeated i startled at the desperation of the idea even so said the author despondingly you cannot conceive what an effect the composition of these tales has had on me i have become ambitious of a bubble and careless of solid reputation i am surrounding myself with shadows which bewilder me by aping the realities of life they have drawn me aside from the beaten path of the world and led me into a strange sort of solitude a solitude in the midst of men where nobody wishes for what i do nor thinks nor feels as i do the tales have done all this when they are ashes perhaps i shall be as i was before they had existence moreover the sacrifice is less than you may suppose since nobody will publish them that does make a difference indeed said i they have been offered by letter continued oberon reddening with vexation to some seventeen booksellers it would make you stare to read their answers and read them you should only that i burnt them as fast as they arrived one man publishes nothing but another has five novels already under examination what a voluminous mass the unpublished literature of america must be cried i oh the alexandrian manuscripts were nothing to it said my friend well another gentleman is just giving up business on purpose i verily believe to escape publishing my book several however would not absolutely decline the agency on my advancing half the cost of an edition and giving bonds for the remainder besides a high percentage to themselves whether the book sells or not another advises a subscription the villain exclaimed i a fact said oberon in short of all the seventeen booksellers only one has vouchsafed even to read my tales and he a literary dabbler himself i should judge has the impertinence to criticise them proposing what he calls vast improvements and concluding after a general sentence of condemnation with the definitive assurance that he will not be concerned on any terms chapter well said one of the deputies as he backed the horse into the shafts of the buggy in which the pursuers had driven over from the hill we've about as good as got him it isn't hard to follow a man who carries a bird cage with him wherever he goes mcteague crossed the mountains on foot the friday and saturday of that week going over through emigrant gap following the line of the overland railroad he reached reno monday night by degrees a vague plan of action outlined itself in the dentist's mind mexico he muttered to himself mexico that's the place they'll watch the coast and they'll watch the eastern trains but they won't think of mexico the sense of pursuit which had harassed him during the last week of his stay at the big dipper mine had worn off and he believed himself to be very cunning i'm pretty far ahead now i guess he said at reno he boarded a freight on the line of the carson and colorado railroad paying for a passage in the caboose freights don run on schedule time he muttered and a conductor on a passenger train makes it his business to study faces i'll stay with this train as far as it goes the freight worked slowly southward through western nevada the country becoming hourly more and more desolate and abandoned after leaving walker lake the country began and the freight rolled heavily over tracks that threw off visible layers of heat at times it stopped whole half days on sidings or by water tanks and the engineer and fireman came back to the caboose and played poker with the conductor and train crew the dentist sat apart behind the stove smoking pipe after pipe of cheap tobacco sometimes he joined in the poker games he had learned poker when a boy at the mine and after a few deals his knowledge returned to him but for the most part he was taciturn and unsociable and rarely spoke to the others unless spoken to first the crew recognized the type and the impression gained ground among them that he had done for a keeper at truckee and was trying to get down into arizona mcteague heard two brakemen discussing him one night as they stood outside by the halted train the keeper called him a bastard that's what picachos told me one of them remarked and started to draw his gun an this fellar did for him with a hayfork he's a horse doctor this chap is and the keeper had got the law on him so's he couldn't practise any more an he was sore about it near a place called queen's the train reentered california and mcteague observed with relief that the line of track which had hitherto held westward curved sharply to the south again the train was unmolested occasionally the crew fought with a gang of tramps who attempted to ride the brake beams and once in the northern part of inyo county while they were halted at a water tank an immense indian buck blanketed to the ground approached mcteague as he stood on the roadbed stretching his legs and without a word presented to him a filthy crumpled letter the letter was to the effect that the buck big jim was a good indian and deserving of charity the signature was illegible the dentist stared at the letter returned it to the buck and regained the train just as it started neither had spoken the buck did not move from his position and fully five minutes afterward when the freight was miles away the dentist looked back and saw him still standing motionless between the rails a forlorn and solitary point of red lost in the immensity of the surrounding white blur of the desert at length the mountains began again rising up on either side of the track vast naked hills of white sand and red rock spotted with blue shadows here and there a patch of green was spread like a gay over the sand all at once mount whitney leaped over the horizon independence was reached and passed the freight nearly emptied by now and much shortened rolled along the shores of owen lake at a place called keeler it stopped definitely it was the terminus of the road the town of keeler was a town not unlike iowa hill the the bar and hotel the odd fellows hall and the livery stable being the principal buildings where to now muttered mcteague to himself as he sat on the edge of the bed in his room in the hotel he hung the canary in the window filled its little bathtub and watched it take its bath with enormous satisfaction where to now he muttered again this is as far as the railroad goes an it won do for me to stay in a town yet a while no it won do i got to clear out where to that's the word where to i'll go down to supper now he went on whispering his thoughts aloud so that they would take more concrete shape in his mind i'll go down to supper now an then i'll hang aroun the bar this evening till i get the lay of this land maybe this is fruit country though it looks more like a cattle country maybe it's a mining country if it's a mining country he continued puckering his heavy eyebrows if it's a mining country an the mines are far enough off the roads maybe i'd better get to the mines an lay quiet for a month before i try to get any farther south chapter xvii retiring from the megaphones were constructed out of heavy and penrod sam and herman set out in different directions delivering vocally the inflammatory proclamation of the poster to a large section of the residential quarter and leaving roderick magsworth bitts junior with verman in the loft shielded from all deadhead eyes upon the return of the heralds the schofield and williams military band played deafeningly and an awakened public once more thronged to fill the coffers of the firm prosperity smiled again the very first audience after the acquisition of roderick was larger than the largest of the morning master bitts the only exhibit placed upon a box was a supercurio all eyes fastened upon him and remained hungrily feasting throughout penrod's luminous oration but the glory of one light must ever be the dimming of another we dwell in a vale of seesaws and cobwebs spin fastest upon laurel verman the tattooed wild boy speaking only in his native foreign languages verman the gay verman the caperer capered no more he chuckled no more he beckoned no more nor tapped his chest nor wreathed his idolatrous face in smiles gone all gone were his little artifices for attracting the general attention to himself gone was every engaging mannerism which had endeared him to the mercurial public he squatted against the wall and glowered at the new sensation it was the old story the old old story of too much temperament verman was suffering from artistic jealousy the second audience contained a adult a spectacled young man whose poignant attention was very flattering he remained after the lecture and put a few questions to roddy which were answered rather confusedly upon promptings from penrod the young man went away without having stated the object of his interrogations but it became quite plain later in the day this same object caused the spectacled young man to make several brief but stimulating calls directly after leaving the schofield and williams big show and the consequences thereof loitered not by the wayside the big show was at high tide not only was the auditorium filled and throbbing there was an indubitable line by no means wholly juvenile waiting for admission to the next pufformance a group stood in the street examining the poster earnestly as it glowed in the long slanting rays of the westward sun and people in automobiles and other vehicles had halted wheel in the street to read the message so piquantly given to the world these were the conditions when a crested victoria arrived at a gallop and a large chastely magnificent and highly flushed woman descended and progressed across the yard with an air of violence at sight of her the adults of the waiting line hastily disappeared and most of the pausing vehicles moved instantly on their way she was followed by a stricken man in livery the stairs to the auditorium were narrow and steep mrs roderick magsworth bitts was of a stout favour and the voice of penrod was audible during the ascent gentilmun and each and all are now gazing upon roderick magsworth bitts junior the only living nephew of the great rena magsworth she stuck ars'nic in the milk of eight separate and distinck people to put in their coffee and each and all of em died the great ars'nic murderess rena magsworth gentilmun and and roddy's her only living nephew she's a relation of all the bitts family but he's her one and only living nephew next july she's goin to be hung and each and all you now see before you penrod paused abruptly seeing something before himself the august and awful presence which filled the entryway and his words it should be related froze upon his lips before herself mrs roderick magsworth bitts saw her son her scion wearing a moustache and sideburns of blue and perched upon a box flanked by sherman and verman the michigan rats the indian dog duke herman and the dog part alligator roddy also saw something before himself it needed no prophet to read the countenance of the dread apparition in the entryway his mouth opened remained open then filled to capacity with a calamitous sound of grief not unmingled with apprehension penrod's reason staggered under the crisis for a horrible moment he saw mrs roderick magsworth bitts approaching like some fatal mountain in avalanche she seemed to grow larger and redder lightnings played about her head he had a vague consciousness of the audience spraying out in flight of the squealings tramplings and dispersals of a stricken field the mountain was close upon him he stood by the open mouth of the which went through the floor to the manger below penrod also went through the floor he propelled himself into the chute and shot down but not quite to the manger for mr samuel williams had thoughtfully stepped into the chute a moment in advance of his partner penrod lit upon sam catastrophic noises resounded in the loft volcanoes seemed to romp upon the stairway there ensued a period when only a shrill keening marked the passing of roderick as he was borne to the tumbril then all was silence sunset striking through a western window rouged the walls of the schofields library where gathered a joint family council and court martial of four mrs schofield mr schofield and mr and mrs williams parents of samuel of that ilk mr williams read aloud a conspicuous passage from the last edition of the evening paper section as the evening drew on karenin and those who were about him went up upon the roof of the buildings so that they might the better watch the sunset and the flushing of the mountains and the coming of the afterglow they were joined by two of the surgeons from the laboratories below and presently by a nurse who brought karenin refreshment in a thin glass cup it was a cloudless windless evening under the deep blue sky and far away to the north glittered two biplanes on the way to the observatories on everest two hundred miles distant over the precipices to the east the little group of people watched them pass over the mountains and vanish into the blue and then for a time they talked of the work that the observatory was doing from that they passed to the whole process of research about the world and so thoughts returned again to the mind of the world and the great future that was opening upon imagination he asked the surgeons many questions upon the detailed possibilities of their science and he was keenly interested and excited by the things they told him and as they talked the sun touched the mountains and became very swiftly a blazing and indented hemisphere of liquid flame and sank karenin looked blinking at the last quivering rim of incandescence and shaded his eyes and became silent presently he gave a little start what asked rachel borken i had forgotten he said what had you forgotten i had forgotten about the operation i have been so interested as man that i have nearly forgotten marcus karenin marcus karenin must go under your knife fowler and very probably marcus karenin will die he raised his slightly shrivelled hand it does not matter fowler it scarcely matters even to me for indeed is it karenin who has been sitting here and talking is it not rather a common mind fowler that has played about between us you and i and all of us have added thought to thought but the thread is neither you nor me what is true we all have when the individual has altogether brought himself to the test and winnowing of expression then the individual is done i feel as though i had already been emptied out of that little vessel that marcus karenin which in my youth held me so tightly and completely your beauty dear edith and your broad brow dear rachel and you fowler with your firm and skilful hands are now almost as much to me as this hand that beats the arm of my chair and as little me and the spirit that desires to know the spirit that resolves to do that spirit that lives and has talked in us lived in athens lived in florence lives on i know for ever and you old sun with your sword of flame searing these poor eyes of marcus for the last time of all beware of me you think i die and indeed i am only taking off one more coat to get at you i have

when i went through the wonderful adventures herein set down with the memory of my boyish feelings strong upon me i present my book specially to boys in the earnest hope that they may derive valuable information much pleasure great profit and unbounded amusement from its pages one word more if there is any boy or man who loves to be melancholy and morose and who cannot enter with kindly sympathy into the regions of fun let me seriously advise him to shut my book and put it away it is not meant for him ralph rover chapter i the beginning my early life and character i thirst for adventure in foreign lands and go to sea roving has always been and still is my ruling passion the joy of my heart the very sunshine of my existence in childhood in boyhood and in man's estate i have been a rover not a mere rambler among the woody glens and upon the of my own native land but an enthusiastic rover throughout the length and breadth of the wide wide world it was a wild black night of howling storm the night in which i was born on the foaming bosom of the broad atlantic ocean my father was a my grandfather was a my had been a marine nobody could tell positively what occupation his father had followed but my dear mother used to assert that he had been a midshipman whose grandfather on the mother's side had been an admiral in the royal navy at anyrate we knew that as far back as our family could be traced it had been intimately connected with the great watery waste indeed this was the case on both sides of the house for my mother always went to sea with my father on his long voyages and so spent the greater part of her life upon the water thus it was i suppose that i came to inherit a roving disposition soon after i was born my father being old retired from a seafaring life purchased a small cottage in a fishing village on the west coast of england and settled down to spend the evening of his life on the shores of that sea which had for so many years been his home it was not long after this that i began to show the roving spirit that dwelt within me for some time past my infant legs had been gaining strength so that i came to be dissatisfied with rubbing the skin off my chubby knees by walking on them and made many attempts to stand up and walk like a man all of which attempts however resulted in my sitting down violently and in sudden surprise one day i took advantage of my dear mother's absence to make another effort and to my joy i actually succeeded in reaching the doorstep over which i tumbled into a pool of muddy water that lay before my father's cottage door ah how vividly i remember the horror of my poor mother when she found me sweltering in the mud amongst a group of cackling ducks and the tenderness with which she stripped off my dripping clothes and washed my dirty little body from this time forth my rambles became more frequent and as i grew older more distant until at last i had wandered far and near on the shore and in the woods around our humble dwelling and did not rest content until my father bound me apprentice to a coasting vessel and let me go to sea for some years i was happy in visiting the and in coasting along the shores of my native land my christian name was ralph and my comrades added to this the name of rover in consequence of the passion which i always evinced for travelling rover was not my real name but as i never received any other i came at last to answer to it as naturally as to my proper name and as it is not a bad one i see no good reason why i should not introduce myself to the reader as ralph rover my shipmates were kind fellows and they and i got on very well together they did indeed very frequently make game of and banter me but not unkindly and i overheard them sometimes saying that ralph rover was a queer fellow this i must confess surprised me much and i pondered the saying long but could come at no satisfactory conclusion as to that wherein my lay it is true i was a quiet lad and seldom spoke except when spoken to moreover i never could understand the jokes of my companions even when they were explained to me which dulness in apprehension occasioned me much grief however i tried to make up for it by smiling and looking pleased when i observed that they were laughing at some witticism which i had failed to detect i was also very fond of inquiring into the nature of things and their causes and often fell into fits of abstraction while thus engaged in my mind but in all this i saw nothing that did not seem to be exceedingly natural and could by no means understand why my comrades should call me an fellow the dream of akinosuke in the district called toichi of yamato province there used to live a goshi named miyata akinosuke here i must tell you that injapanese feudal times there was a privileged class corresponding to the class of yeomenin england and these were called goshi in akinosuke's garden there was a great and ancient under which he was wont to rest on sultry days one very warm afternoon he was sitting under this tree with two of his friends chatting and drinking wine when he felt all of a sudden very drowsy so drowsy that he begged his friends to excuse him for taking a nap in their presence then he lay down at the foot of the tree and dreamed this dream he thought that as he was lying there in his garden he saw a procession like the train of some great daimyo descending a hill near by and that he got up to look at it a very grand procession it proved to be more imposing than anything of the kind which he had ever seen before and it was advancing toward his dwelling he observed in the van of it a number of young men richly appareled who were drawing a great lacquered or hung with bright blue silk when the procession arrived within a short distance of the house it halted and a richly dressed man evidently a person of rank advanced from it approached akinosuke bowed to him profoundly and then said honored sir you see before you a kerai vassal of the kokuo of tokoyo my master the king commands me to greet you in his august name and to place myself wholly at your disposal he also bids me inform you that he augustly desires your presence at the palace be therefore pleased immediately to enter this honorable carriage which he has sent for your conveyance upon hearing these words akinosuke wanted to make some fitting reply but he was too much astonished and embarrassed for speech and in the same moment his will seemed to melt away from him so that he could only do as the kerai bade him he entered the carriage the kerai took a place beside him and made a signal the drawers seizing the silken ropes turned the great vehicle southward and the journey began in a very short time to akinosuke's amazement the carriage stopped in front of a huge gateway romon of a chinese style which he had never before seen here the kerai dismounted saying i go to announce the honorable arrival and he disappeared after some little waiting akinosuke saw two men wearing robes of purple silk and high caps of the form indicating lofty rank come from the gateway these after having respectfully saluted him helped him to descend from the carriage and led him through the great gate and across a vast garden to the entrance of a palace whose front appeared to extend west and east to a distance of miles akinosuke was then shown into a of wonderful size and splendor his guides conducted him to the place of honor and respectfully seated themselves apart while in costume of ceremony brought refreshments when akinosuke had partaken of the refreshments the two attendants bowed low before him and addressed him in the following words each speaking alternately according to the etiquette of courts it is now our honorable duty to inform you as to the reason of your having been summoned hither our master the king augustly desires that you become his and it is his wish and command that you shall wed this very day the august princess his we shall soon conduct you to the where his augustness even now is waiting to receive you but it will be necessary that we first invest you with the appropriate garments of ceremony having thus spoken the attendants rose together and proceeded to an alcove containing a great chest of gold lacquer they opened the chest and took from it various roes and girdles of rich material and a kamuri or regal headdress with these they attired akinosuke as befitted a princely bridegroom and he was then conducted to the where he saw the kokuo of tokoyo seated upon the daiza wearing a high black cap of state and robed in robes of yellow silk before the daiza to left and right a multitude of dignitaries sat in rank motionless and splendid as images in a temple and akinosuke advancing into their midst saluted the king with the triple prostration of usage the king greeted him with gracious words and then said you have already been informed as to the reason of your having been summoned to our presence we have decided that you shall become the adopted husband of our only daughter and the wedding ceremony shall now be performed as the king finished speaking a sound of joyful music was heard and a long train of beautiful court ladies advanced from behind a curtain to conduct akinosuke to the room in which he bride awaited him the room was immense but it could scarcely contain the multitude of guests assembled to witness the wedding ceremony all bowed down before akinosuke as he took his place facing the king's daughter on the prepared for him as a maiden of heaven the bride appeared to be and her robes were beautiful as a summer sky and the marriage was performed amid great rejoicing chapter i am born whether i shall turn out to be the hero of my own life or whether that station will be held by anybody else these pages must show to begin my life with the beginning of my life i record that i was born as i have been informed and believe on a friday at twelve at night it was remarked that the clock began to strike and i began to cry simultaneously in consideration of the day and hour of my birth it was declared by the nurse and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of our becoming personally acquainted first that i was destined to be unlucky in life and secondly that i was privileged to see ghosts and spirits both these gifts inevitably attaching as they believed to all unlucky infants of either gender born towards the small hours on a friday night i need say nothing here on the first head because nothing can show better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified by the result on the second branch of the question i will only remark that unless i ran through that part of my inheritance while i was still a baby i have not come into it yet but i do not at all complain of having been kept out of this property and if anybody else should be in the present enjoyment of it he is heartily welcome to keep it i was born with a caul which was advertised for sale in the newspapers at the low price of fifteen guineas whether people were short of money about that time or were short of faith and preferred cork jackets i know all i know is that there was but one solitary bidding and that was from an attorney connected with the business who offered two pounds in cash and the balance in sherry but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss for as to sherry my poor dear own sherry was in the market then and ten years afterwards the caul was put up in a raffle down in our part of the country to fifty members at a head the winner to spend five shillings i was present myself and i remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused at a part of myself being disposed of in that way the caul was won i recollect by an old lady with a who very reluctantly produced from it the stipulated five shillings all in halfpence and twopence halfpenny short as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic to endeavour without any effect to prove to her it is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there that she was never drowned but died triumphantly in bed at i have understood that it was to the last her proudest boast that she never had been on the water in her life except upon a bridge and that over her tea to which she was extremely partial she to the last expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and others who had the presumption to go meandering about the world it was in vain to represent to her that some conveniences tea perhaps included resulted from this objectionable practice she always returned with greater emphasis and with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection let us have no meandering not to meander myself at present i will go back to my birth i was born at blunderstone in suffolk or there by as they say in scotland i was a posthumous child my eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months when mine opened on it there is something strange to me even now in the reflection that he never saw me and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that i have of my first childish associations with his white in the churchyard and of the indefinable compassion i used to feel for it lying out alone there in the dark night when our little parlour was warm and bright with fire and candle and the doors of our house were almost cruelly it seemed to me sometimes bolted and locked against it an aunt of my and consequently a of mine of whom i shall have more to relate by and by was the principal magnate of our family miss trotwood or miss betsey as my poor mother always called her when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable personage to mention her at all which was seldom had been married to a husband younger than herself who was very handsome except in the sense of the homely adage handsome is that handsome does for he was strongly suspected of having beaten miss betsey and even of having once on a disputed question of supplies made some hasty but determined arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs window these evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced miss betsey to pay him off and effect a separation by mutual consent he went to india with his capital and there according to a wild legend in our family he was once seen riding on an elephant in company with a baboon but i think it must have been a baboo or a begum anyhow from india tidings of his death reached home within ten years how they affected my aunt nobody knew for immediately upon the separation she took her maiden name again bought a cottage in a hamlet on the a long way off established herself there as a single woman with one servant and was understood to live secluded ever afterwards in an inflexible retirement chapter the sick ox the thunder moon passed quickly by the hay was in the barley partly so day by day the whitefaced oxen toiled at the creaking yoke as the loads of hay and grain were jounced cumbrously over roots and stumps of the virgin fields everything was promising well when as usual there came a thunderbolt out of the clear sky buck the off ox fell sick those who know little about cattle have written much of the meek and patient ox those who know them well tell us that the ox is the most cussedest of all cussed animals a sneak a bully a coward a thief a shirk a schemer and when he is not in mischief he is thinking about it the wickedest pack mule that ever bucked his burden is a pinfeathered compared with an average ox there are some gentle oxen but they are rare most are treacherous some are dangerous and these are best got rid of as they mislead their yoke mates and mislay their drivers van's two oxen buck and bright manifested the usual variety and contrariety of disposition they were all right when well handled and this rolf could do better than van for he was raised on oxen and van's over voluble sputtering seemed ill comprehended of the massive yoke beasts the simpler and fewer orders of the yankee were so obviously successful that van had resigned the whip of authority and rolf was driver ordinarily an ox driver walks on the hew nigh or left side near the head of his team shouting gee right haw left get up steady or whoa stop accompanying the order with a waving of the whip foolish drivers lash the oxen on the haw side when they wish them to gee and vice versa but it is notorious that all good drivers do little lashing spare the lash or spoil your team so it was not long before rolf could guide them from the top of the load as they travelled from shook to shook in the field this voice of command saved his life or at least his limb one morning for he made a misstep that tumbled him down between the oxen and the wagon at once the team started but his ringing whoa brought them to a dead stop and saved him whereas had it been van's whoa it would have set them off at a run for every shout from him meant a whip lick to follow thus rolf won the respect if not the love of the huge beasts more and more they were his charge and when on that sad morning in the last of the barley van came in ach vot shall i do vot shall i do dot buck ox be nigh dead alas there he lay on the ground his head sometimes raised sometimes stretched out flat while the huge creature uttered short moans at times only four years before rolf had seen that same thing at redding the rolling eye the working of the belly muscles the straining and moaning it's colic have you any ginger no i hat only dot soft soap what soft soap had to do with ginger was not clear and rolf wondered if it had some rare occult medical power that had escaped his mother do you know where there's any slippery elm yah then bring a big boiling of the bark while i get some peppermint the elm bark was boiled till it made a kettleful of brown slime the peppermint was dried above the stove till it could be powdered and mixed with the slippery slush some sulphur and some soda were discovered and stirred in on general principles and they hastened to the huge helpless creature in the field poor buck seemed worse than ever he was flat on his side with his spine humped up moaning and straining at intervals but now relief was in sight so thought the men with a tin dipper they tried to pour some relief into the open mouth of the sufferer who had so little appreciation that he simply taxed his remaining strength to blow it out in their faces several attempts ended the same way then the brute in what looked like temper swung his muzzle and dashed the whole dipper away next they tried the usual method mixing it with a bran mash considered a delicacy in the bovine world but buck again took notice under pressure only to dash it away and waste it all it occurred to them they might force it down his throat if they could raise his head so they used a hand lever and a prop to elevate the muzzle and were about to try another inpour when buck leaped to his feet and behaving like one who has been shamming made at full gallop for the stable nor stopped till safely in his stall where at once he dropped in all the evident agony of a new spasm it is a common thing for oxen to sham sick but this was the real thing and it seemed they were going to lose the ox which meant also lose a large part of the harvest iii indisputably the most striking defect of this modern american literature is the fact that the production of anything at all resembling literature is scarcely anywhere apparent innumerable instead are turning out a vast quantity of the candidly recognized purpose of which is to kill time and which it has been asserted though perhaps too sweepingly ought not to be vended over but rather in drugstores along with the other narcotics it is begging the question to protest that the class of people who a generation ago read nothing now at least read novels and to regard this as a change for the better by similar logic it would be more wholesome to breakfast off laudanum than to omit the meal entirely the nineteenth century in fact by making education popular has produced in america the curious spectacle of a with essentially nonliterary tastes formerly better books were published because they were intended for persons who turned to reading through a natural bent of mind whereas the modern american novel of commerce is addressed to us average people who read when we read at all in violation of every innate instinct such grounds as yet exist for hopefulness on the part of those who cordially care for belles lettres are to be found elsewhere than in the crowded of fiction where genuine intelligence panders on all sides to ignorance and indolence the phrase may seem to have no very civil ring but reflection will assure the that two indispensable requisites nowadays of a pecuniarily successful novel are really that it make no demand upon the reader's imagination and that it rigorously refrain from assuming its reader to possess any particular information on any subject whatever the author who writes over the head of the public is the most dangerous enemy of his publisher and the most insidious as well because so many publishers are in private life interested in literary matters and would readily permit this personal foible to influence the exercise of their vocation were it possible to do so upon the preferable side of bankruptcy but publishers among innumerable other conditions must weigh the fact that no novel which does not deal with modern times is ever really popular among the it is difficult to imagine a tale whose action developed under the rule of the caesars or the merovingians being treated as more than a literary hors d'oeuvre we purchasers of vital novels know nothing about the period beyond a hazy association of it with the restrictions of the schoolroom our sluggish imaginations instinctively rebel against the exertion of forming any notion of such a period and all the human nature that exists even in persons is stirred up to resentment against the book's author for presuming to know more than a potential patron the book in fine simply irritates the person and she for it is only women who willingly brave the terrors of where most of our new books are bought nowadays quite naturally puts it aside in favor of some keen and daring study of american life that is warranted to grip the reader so modernity of scene is everywhere necessitated as an essential qualification for a book's discussion at the literary evenings of the local woman's club and modernity of scene of course is almost always fatal to the permanent worth of fictitious narrative it may seem banal here to recall the truism that art never reproduces its surroundings but such banality is often justified by our human proneness to shuffle over the fact that many truisms are true and this one is indisputable that what mankind has generally agreed to accept as art in any of the varied forms of fictitious narrative has never been a truthful reproduction of the artist's era indeed in the higher walks of fiction art has never reproduced anything but has always dealt with the facts and laws of life as so much crude material which must be transmuted into comeliness when shakespeare pronounced his celebrated dictum about art's holding the mirror up to nature he was no doubt alluding to the circumstance that a mirror reverses everything which it reflects nourishment for much wildish speculation in fact can be got by considering what the world's literature would be had its authors restricted themselves as do we americans so sedulously and unavoidably to writing of contemporaneous happenings in no author of the first class since homer's infancy has ever in his happier efforts concerned himself at all with the great problems of his particular day and among geniuses of the second rank you will find such ephemeralities adroitly utilized only when they are distorted into enduring parodies of their actual selves by the broad humor of a dickens or the colossal fantasy of a balzac in such cases as the latter two writers however we have an otherwise competent artist handicapped by a personality so marked that whatever he may nominally write about the result is above all else an exposure of the writer's idiosyncrasies then too the laws of any locale wherein mr pickwick achieves a competence in business or of a society wherein vautrin becomes chief of police are upon the face of it it suffices that as a general rule in the true artist finds an ample if restricted field wherein the proper functions of the preacher or the ventriloquist or the photographer or of the public prosecutor are exercised with equal lack of grace a vision of sandy blight i'd been humping my back and crouching and groaning for an hour or so in the darkest corner of the travellers hut tortured by the demon of sandy blight it was too hot to travel and there was no one there except ourselves and mitchell's cattle pup we were waiting till after sundown for i couldn't have travelled in the daylight anyway mitchell had tied a wet towel round my eyes and led me for the last mile or two by another towel one end fastened to his belt behind and the other in my hand as i walked in his tracks and oh but this was a relief it was out of the dust and glare and the flies didn't come into the dark hut and i could hump and stick my knees in my eyes and groan in comfort i didn't want a thousand a year or anything i only wanted relief for my eyes that was all i prayed for in this world when the sun got down a bit mitchell started poking round and presently he found amongst the rubbish a medicine bottle corked tight when he rubbed the dirt off a piece of notepaper that was pasted on he saw written on it he drew the cork with his teeth smelt the water stuck his little finger in turned the bottle upside down tasted the top of his finger and reckoned the stuff was all right here wake up joe he shouted here's a bottle of tears a bottler wot i groaned said mitchell are you sure it's all right i didn't want to be poisoned or have my eyes burnt out by mistake perhaps some burning acid had got into that bottle or the label had been put on or left on in mistake or carelessness i dunno said mitchell but there's no harm in tryin i chanced it i lay down on my back in a bunk and mitchell dragged my lids up and spilt half a bottle of over my the relief was almost instantaneous i never experienced such a quick cure in my life i carried the bottle in my swag for a long time afterwards with an idea of getting it analysed but left it behind at last in a camp mitchell scratched his head thoughtfully and watched me for a while i think i'll wait a bit longer he said at last and if it doesn't blind you i'll put some in my eyes i'm getting a touch of blight myself now that's the fault of travelling with a mate who's always catching something that's no good to him as it grew dark outside we talked of and and up north and ordinary flies and branched off to barcoo rot and struck the track again at bees and bee stings when we got to bees mitchell sat smoking for a while and looking dreamily backwards along tracks and branch tracks and round corners and circles he had travelled right back to the short narrow innocent bit of track that ends in a vague misty point like the end of a long straight cleared road in the moonlight as far back as we can remember i had about fourteen hives said mitchell we used to call them swarms no matter whether they were flying or in the box when i left home first time i kept them behind the shed in the shade on tables of galvanised iron cases turned down on stakes but i had to make legs later on and stand them in pans of water on account of the ants when the bees swarmed and some hives sent out the lord knows how many swarms in a year it seemed to me we'd em and throw water on em to make em believe the biggest thunderstorm was coming to drown the oldest inhabitant and if they didn't get the start of us and rise they'd settle on a branch generally on one of the scraggy fruit trees it was rough on the bees come to think of it their instinct told them it was going to be fine and the noise and water told them it was raining they must have thought that nature was mad drunk or gone ratty or the end of the world had come we'd rig up a table with a box upside down under the branch cover our face with a piece of mosquito net have rags burning round and then give the branch a sudden jerk turn the box down and run if we got most of the bees in the rest that were hanging to the bough or flying round would follow and then we reckoned we'd shook the queen in if the bees in the box came out and joined the others we'd reckon we hadn't shook the queen in and go for them again when a hive was full of honey we'd turn the box upside down turn the empty box mouth down on top of it and drum and hammer on the lower box with a stick till all the bees went up into the top box i suppose it made their heads ache and they went up on that account the start with so much to think about the few weeks that were left between vacation and the country passed quickly for the bobbseys as told in any first book the bobbsey twins this little family had a splendid home in lakeport where mr bobbsey was a lumber merchant the mother and father were both young themselves and always took part in their children's joys and sorrows for there were sorrows sometimes think of poor little freddie getting shut up all alone in a big store with only a little black kitten snoop to keep him from being scared to death that was told of in the first book for freddie went shopping one day with his mamma and wandered off a little bit presently he found himself in the basement of the store there he had so much trouble in getting out he fell asleep in the meantime then when he awoke and it was all dark and the great big janitor came to rescue him oh freddie thought the man might even be a giant when he first heard the janitor's voice in the dark store freddie often got in trouble but like most good little boys he was always saved just at the right time for they say good children have real angels watching over them nan bert and flossie all had plenty of exciting experiences too as told in the bobbsey twins for among other neighbors there was danny rugg a boy who always tried to make trouble for bert and sometimes almost succeeded in getting bert into hot water as dinah expressed it of course nan had her friends as all big girls have but bert her twin brother was her dearest chum just as freddie was flossie's when we get to the country we will plant trees go fishing and pick blackberries nan said one day yes and i'm going with harry out exploring bert announced i'm just going to plant things prim little flossie lisped i just love melons and ice cream and ice cream can you really plant ice cream freddie asked innocently which made the others all laugh at flossie's funny plans i'm going to have chickens freddie told them i'm going to have one of those queer chicken coops that you shut up tight and when you open it it's just full of little kippies oh an incubator you mean nan explained that's a machine for raising chickens without any mother but mine are going to have a mother freddie corrected thinking how sad little chickens would be without a kind mamma like his own but how can they have a mother where there isn't any for them flossie asked with a girl's queer way of reasoning i'll get them one freddie protested i'll let snoop be their mamma a cat the idea why he would eat em all up flossie argued not if i whipped him once for doing it the brother insisted then nan and bert began to tease him for whipping the kitten after the chickens had been all eaten up so the merry days went on until at last vacation came just one more night nan told flossie and freddie when she prepared them for bed to help her very busy mother bert assisted his father with the packing up for the taking of a whole family to the country meant lots of clothes besides some books and just a few toys then there was bert's tool box he knew he would need that at meadow brook the morning came at last a beautiful bright day a rare one for traveling for a fine shower the evening before had washed and cooled things off splendidly now come children mr bobbsey told the excited youngsters keep track of your things sam will be ready in a few minutes and then we must be off promptly sam pulled up to the door with the family carriage and all hurried to get in oh snoop snoop cried freddie he's in the library in the box dinah get him quick get him and dinah ran back after the little kitten here you is freddie she gasped out of breath from hurrying you don't go and forget poor snoopy and she climbed in beside sam then they started oh my lan yelled dinah presently in distress sam johnson you jest

interrupted we will have lunch on the train but i couldn't leab dat nice lunch i got ready fo de chillen in between missus the colored woman urged i'll get it quick as a wink now sam you rush in dar quick and fetch dat red and white basket dat smells like chicken so the maid had her way much to the delight of bert and freddie who liked nothing so well as one of dinah's homemade lunches the railroad station was reached without mishap and while mr bobbsey attended to getting the baskets checked at the little window in the big round office the children sat about exploring freddie hung back a little when a locomotive steamed up he clung to his mother's skirt yet wanted to see how the machine worked new year's night it was dark enough for anything in dead man's gap a round warm close darkness in which retreating sounds seemed to be cut off suddenly at a distance of a hundred yards or so instead of growing faint and fainter and dying away to strike the ear once or twice again and after minutes it might seem with startling distinctness before being finally lost in the distance as it is on clear frosty nights so with the sounds of horses hoofs stumbling on the rough through the saddle the clatter of stones and scrape of gravel down the hidden siding and the low sound of men's voices blurred and speaking in monosyllables and at intervals it seemed and in hushed awed tones as though they carried a corpse to practical eyes grown used to such a darkness and at the nearest point the passing blurrs would have suggested two riders on bush hacks leading a third with an empty saddle on its back a lady's or if one could have distinguished the horns they may have struck a soft track or level or rounded the buttress of the hill higher up but before they had time to reach or round the foot of the spur blurs whispers stumble and clatter of hoofs jingle of bridle rings and the occasional clank together of stirrup irons seemed shut off as suddenly and completely as though a great door had swung to behind them it was dark enough on the glaringest of days down in the lonely hollow or pocket between two spurs at the head of a blind gully behind mount buckaroo where there was a more or less dusty patch barely defined even in broad daylight by a spidery fence on three sides and a thin dignified with the adjective though rails and posts were mostly of saplings split in halves running along the frontage in about the middle of it a little slab hut overshadowed by a big shed was pointed out as johnny mears's farm black as as charcoal said johnny mears he had never seen coal and was a cautious man whose ideas came slowly he stooped close by the fence with his hands on his knees to sky the loom of his big shed and so get his bearings he had been to have a look at the penned calves and see that all were up and pegged for the words of john mears junior especially when delivered rapidly and shrilly and in injured tones were not to be relied upon in these matters it's hot enough to melt the belly out of my fiddle said johnny mears to his wife who sat on a stool by the rough table in the little whitewashed putting a patch of patches over the seat of a pair of moleskin knickerbockers he lit his pipe moved a stool to the side of the great empty fireplace where it looked cooler might have been cooler on account of a possible draught suggested by the presence of the chimney and where therefore he felt a breath cooler he took his fiddle from a convenient shelf tuned it slowly and carefully holding his pipe in his mouth well up and to one side as if the fiddle were an inquisitive and restless baby he played little drops o brandy three times right through without variations blinking solemnly the while then he put the violin carefully back in its box and started to cut up another pipeful you should have gone johnny said the haggard little woman rackin the horse out a night like this retorted johnny and startin ploughin it ain't worth while let them come for me if they want me dance on a night like this why they'll dance in but you promised it won't do you no good johnny it won't do me no harm the little woman went on stitching it's smotherin hot said johnny with an impatient oath i don't know whether i'll turn in or turn out under the shed it's too d d hot to roost indoors she bent her head lower over the patch one smoked and the other stitched in silence for twenty minutes or so during which time johnny might be supposed to have been deliberating listlessly as to whether he'd camp out on account of the heat or turn in but he broke the silence with a clout at a mosquito on the nape of his neck and a bad word i wish you wouldn't swear so much johnny she said wearily at least not he looked at her blankly why why what's the matter with you mary what's more than any other night to you i see no harm can't a man swear when a mosquito sticks him i i was only thinking of the boys johnny the boys why they're both on the hay in the shed he stared at her again shifted uneasily crossed the other leg tightly frowned blinked and reached for the matches you look a bit mary it's the heat that makes us all a bit ratty at times better put that by and have a swill o oatmeal and water and turn in it's too hot to go to bed i couldn't sleep i'm all right i'll i'll just finish this just reach me a drink from the the pannikin's on the hob there by your boot faithful's plain dealing with talkative they say you are a spot among christians and that religion fareth the worse for your ungodly conversation that some have already stumbled at your wicked ways and that more are in danger of being destroyed thereby your religion and an and covetousness and uncleanness and swearing and lying and keeping c will stand together the proverb is true of you which is said of a whore to wit that she is a shame to all women so are you a shame to all professors talk since you are ready to take up reports and to judge so rashly as you do i cannot but conclude you are some peevish or melancholy man not fit to be discoursed with and so adieu chr then came up christian and said to his brother i told you how it would happen your words and his lusts could not agree he had rather leave your company than reform his life but he is gone as i said let him go the loss is no man's but his own he has saved us the trouble of going from him for he continuing as i suppose he will do as he is he would have been but a blot in our company besides the apostle says from such withdraw thyself faith but i am glad we had this little discourse with him it may happen that he will think of it again however i have dealt plainly with him and so am clear of his blood if he perisheth chr you did well to talk so plainly to him as you did there is but little of this faithful dealing with men and that makes religion to stink so in the nostrils of many as it doth for they are these talkative fools whose religion is only in word and are debauched and vain in their conversation that being so much admitted into the fellowship of the godly do puzzle the world blemish christianity and grieve the sincere i wish that all men would deal with such as you have done then should they either be made more conformable to religion or the company of saints would be too hot for them then did faithful say how talkative at first lifts up his plumes how bravely doth he speak how he presumes to drive down all before him but so soon as faithful talks of like the moon that's past the full into the wane he goes and so will all but he that knows thus they went on talking of what they had seen by the way and so made that way easy which would otherwise no doubt have been tedious to them for now they went through a wilderness now when they were got almost quite out of this wilderness faithful chanced to cast his eye back and espied one coming after them and he knew him oh said faithful to his brother who comes yonder then christian looked and said it is my good friend evangelist ay and my good friend too said faithful for it was he that set me in the way to the gate now was evangelist come up to them and thus saluted them evan peace be with you dearly beloved and peace be to your helpers chr welcome welcome my good evangelist the sight of thy countenance brings to my remembrance thy ancient kindness and unwearied labouring for my eternal good faith and a thousand times welcome said good faithful thy company o sweet evangelist how desirable it is to us poor pilgrims evan then said evangelist how hath it fared with you my friends since the time of our last parting what have you met with and how have you behaved yourselves then christian and faithful told him of all things that had happened to them in the way and how and with what difficulty they had arrived at that place evan right glad am i said evangelist not that you have met with trials but that you have been victors and for that you have notwithstanding many weaknesses continued in the way to this very day i say right glad am i of this thing and that for mine own sake and yours i have sowed and you have reaped and the day is coming when both he that sowed and they that reaped shall rejoice together that is if you hold out for in due season ye shall reap if ye faint not john gal the crown is before you and it is an incorruptible one so run that you may obtain it cor some there be that set out for this crown and after they have gone far for it another comes in and takes it from them hold fast therefore that you have let no man take your crown rev you are not yet out of the of the devil you have not resisted unto blood striving against sin let the kingdom be always before you and believe steadfastly concerning things that are invisible let nothing that is on this side the other world get within you and above all look well to your own hearts and to the lusts thereof for they are deceitful above all things and desperately wicked set your faces like a flint you have all power in heaven and earth on your side an etude for emma if you listen long enough and earnestly enough and with ear sufficiently attuned to the music of this sphere there will come to you this reward the violins and oboes and cellos and brasses of humanity which seemed all at variance with each other will unite as one instrument seeming discords and dissonances will blend into harmony and the wail and blare and thrum of humanity's orchestra will sound in your ear the sublime melody of that great symphony called life in her sunny little private office on the twelfth floor of the great that housed the t a buck company emma mcchesney buck sat listening to the that were wafted to her mellowed by height and distance the noises taken separately were the sounds common to a busy new york by the time they reached the little office on the twelfth floor they were softened mellowed debrutalized welded into a weird choirlike chant first high then low rising swelling dying away rising again to a dull roar with now and then vast undertones like the rumbling of a cathedral emma knew that the high clear tenor note was the shrill cry of the lame newsie at the corner of sixth avenue and street those deep thunderous bass notes were the combined reverberation of nearby l trains distant subway and clanging surface cars that sharp staccato was a motorman clanging his bell of warning these things she knew but she liked nevertheless to shut her eyes for a moment in the midst of her busy day and listen to the chant of the city as it came up to her subdued softened strangely beautified the sound saddened even while it filled her with a certain exaltation we have no one word for that sensation the german there's a language has it weltschmerz as distance softened the harsh sounds to her ears so time and experience had given her a perspective on life itself she saw it not as a series of incidents pleasant and unpleasant but as a great universal scheme too mighty to comprehend a scheme that always worked itself out in some miraculous way she had had a singularly full life had emma mcchesney buck a life replete with work leavened by sorrows sweetened with happiness these ingredients make for tolerance she saw for example how the capable modern staff in the main business office had forged ahead of old pop henderson pop henderson had been head bookkeeper for years but the pen in his trembling hand made queer spidery marks in the ledgers now and his figure seven was very likely to look like a drunken letter z the great bulk of his work was done by the capable comely miss kelly who could juggle figures like a cinquevalli his shaking yellow hand was no match for miss kelly's cool firm fingers but he stayed on at buck's and no one dreamed of insulting him with talk of a pension least of all emma she saw the pathetic old man not only as a figure but as a symbol jock mcchesney very young very handsome very successful coming on to new york from chicago to be married in june found his mother wrapped in this contemplative calm now emma mcchesney buck mother of an son was also surprisingly young and astonishingly handsome and highly successful jock in a lucid moment the day before his wedding took occasion to comment rather resentfully on his mother's attitude it seems to me he said gloomily that for a mother whose only son is about to be handed over to what the writers call the other woman you're pretty resigned not to say cheerful emma glanced up at him as he stood there so tall and straight and altogether good to look at and the glow of love and pride in her eyes belied the lightness of her words i know it she said with mock seriousness and it worries me i can't imagine why i fail to feel those pangs that mothers are supposed to suffer at this time i ought to rend my garments and beat my breast but i can't help thinking of what a stunning girl grace galt is and what a brain she has and how lucky you are to get her any girl with the future that girl had in the advertising field who'll give up four thousand a year and her independence to marry a man does it for love let me tell you if anybody knows you better than your mother son i'd hate to know who it is and if anybody loves you more than your mother well we needn't go into that because it would have to be hypothetical anyway you see jock i've loved you so long and so well that i know your faults as well as your virtues and i love you not in spite of them but because of them oh i don't know interrupted jock with some warmth i'm not perfect but a fellow perfect jock mcchesney when i think of grace's feelings when she discovers that you never close a closet door when i contemplate her emotions on hearing your howl at finding one seed in your orange juice at breakfast when she learns of your secret and unholy passion for neckties that have a dash of red in em and how you have to be restrained by force from fiat mistura this solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the strychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals a lady in england lost her life by taking a similar mixture the precipitated strychnine collected at the bottom and in taking the last dose she swallowed nearly all of it now there was of course no bromide in dr wilkins prescription but you will remember that i mentioned an empty box of bromide powders one or two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine would effectually precipitate the strychnine as the book describes and cause it to be taken in the last dose you will learn later that the person who usually poured out mrs medicine was always extremely careful not to shake the bottle but to leave the sediment at the bottom of it undisturbed throughout the case there have been evidences that the tragedy was intended to take place on monday evening on that day mrs bell wire was neatly cut and on monday evening mademoiselle cynthia was spending the night with friends so that mrs inglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing completely shut off from help of any kind and would have died in all probability before medical aid could have been summoned but in her hurry to be in time for the village entertainment mrs inglethorp forgot to take her medicine and the next day she lunched away from home so that the last and fatal dose was actually taken hours later than had been anticipated by the murderer and it is owing to that delay that the final proof the last link of the chain is now in my hands amid breathless excitement he held out three thin strips of paper a letter in the own mes amis had it been a little clearer in its terms it is possible that mrs inglethorp warned in time would have escaped as it was she realized her danger but not the manner of it in the deathly silence poirot pieced together the slips of paper and clearing his throat read dearest evelyn you will be anxious at hearing nothing it is all right only it will be instead of last night you understand a good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way no one can possibly bring home the crime to me that idea of yours about the bromides was a stroke of genius but we must be very circumspect a false step here my friends the letter breaks off doubtless the writer was interrupted but there can be no question as to his identity we all know this and a howl that was almost a scream broke the silence you devil how did you get it a chair was overturned poirot skipped nimbly aside a quick movement on his part and his assailant fell with a crash messieurs mesdames said poirot with a flourish let me introduce you to the murderer mr alfred inglethorp chapter xiii poirot explains poirot you old villain i said half a mind to strangle you what do you mean by deceiving me as you have done we were sitting in the library several hectic days lay behind us in the room below john and mary were together once more while alfred inglethorp and miss howard were in custody now at last i had poirot to myself and could relieve my still burning curiosity poirot did not answer me for a moment but at last he said i did not deceive you mon ami at most i permitted you to deceive yourself yes but why well it is difficult to explain you see my friend you have a nature so honest and a countenance so transparent that enfin to conceal your feelings is impossible if i had told you my ideas the very first time you saw mr alfred inglethorp that astute gentleman would have in your so expressive idiom smelt a rat and then bonjour to our chances of catching him i think that i have more diplomacy than you give me credit for my friend besought poirot i implore you do not enrage yourself your help has been of the most invaluable it is but the extremely beautiful nature that you have which made me pause well i grumbled a little mollified i still think you might have given me a hint but i did my friend several hints you would not take them think now did i ever say to you that i believed john cavendish guilty did i not on the contrary tell you that he would almost certainly be acquitted yes but and did i not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of bringing the murderer to justice was it not plain to you that i was speaking of two entirely different persons no i said it was not plain to me then again continued poirot at the beginning did i not repeat to you several times that i want mr inglethorp arrested now that should have conveyed something to you do you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that yes to begin with whoever else might benefit by mrs death her husband would benefit the most there was no getting away from that when i went up to styles with you that first day i had no idea as to how the crime had been committed but from what i knew of mr inglethorp i fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to connect him with it when i arrived at the château i realized at once that it was mrs inglethorp who had burnt the will and there by the way you cannot complain my friend for i tried my best to force on you the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer stave ii the first of the three spirits when scrooge awoke it was so dark that looking out of bed he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber he was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters so he listened for the hour to his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven and from seven to eight and regularly up to twelve then stopped twelve it was past two when he went to bed the clock was wrong an icicle must have got into the works twelve he touched the spring of his repeater to correct this most preposterous clock its rapid little pulse beat twelve and stopped why it isn't possible said scrooge that i can have slept through a whole day and far into another night it isn't possible that anything has happened to the sun and this is twelve at noon the idea being an alarming one he scrambled out of bed and groped his way to the window he was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his before he could see anything and could see very little then all he could make out was that it was still very foggy and extremely cold and that there was no noise of people running to and fro and making a great stir as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day and taken possession of the world this was a great relief because three days after sight of this first of exchange pay to mr ebenezer scrooge or his order and so forth would have become a mere united states security if there were no days to count by scrooge went to bed again and thought and thought and thought it over and over and over and could make nothing of it the more he thought the more perplexed he was and the more he endeavoured not to think the more he thought marley's ghost bothered him exceedingly every time he resolved within himself after mature inquiry that it was all a dream his mind flew back again like a strong spring released to its first position and presented the same problem to be worked all through was it a dream or not scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more when he remembered on a sudden that the ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one he resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed and considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to heaven this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power the quarter was so long that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously and missed the clock at length it broke upon his listening ear ding dong a quarter past said scrooge counting ding dong said scrooge ding dong a quarter to it said scrooge ding dong the hour itself said scrooge triumphantly and nothing else he spoke before the hour bell sounded which it now did with a deep dull hollow melancholy one light flashed up in the room upon the instant and the curtains of his bed were drawn the curtains of his bed were drawn aside i tell you by a hand not the curtains at his feet nor the curtains at his back but those to which his face was addressed the curtains of his bed were drawn aside and scrooge starting up into a attitude found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them as close to it as i am now to you and i am standing in the spirit at your elbow it was a strange figure like a child yet not so like a child as like an old man viewed through some supernatural medium which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view and being diminished to a child's proportions its hair which hung about its neck and down its back was white as if with age and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it and the tenderest bloom was on the skin the arms were very long and muscular the hands the same as if its hold were of uncommon strength its legs and feet most delicately formed were like those upper members bare it wore a tunic of the purest white and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt the sheen of which was beautiful it held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand and in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem had its dress trimmed with summer flowers but the strangest thing about it was that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light by which all this was visible and which was doubtless the occasion of its using in its duller moments a great extinguisher for a cap which it now held under its arm even this though when scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness was not its strangest quality for as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another and what was light one instant at another time was dark so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness being now a thing with one arm now with one leg now with twenty legs now a pair of legs without a head now a head without a body of which dissolving parts no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away and in the very wonder of this it would be itself again distinct and clear as ever chapter it is after you have mustered your industrial army into service i said that i should expect the chief difficulty to arise for there its analogy with a military army must cease soldiers have all the same thing and a very simple thing to do namely to practice the manual of arms to march and stand guard but the industrial army must learn and follow two or three hundred diverse trades and avocations what administrative talent can be equal to determining wisely what trade or business every individual in a great nation shall pursue the administration has nothing to do with determining that point who does determine it then i asked every man for himself in accordance with his natural aptitude the utmost pains being taken to enable him to find out what his natural aptitude really is the principle on which our industrial army is organized is that a man's natural endowments mental and physical determine what he can work at most profitably to the nation and most satisfactorily to himself while the obligation of service in some form is not to be evaded voluntary election subject only to necessary regulation is depended on to determine the particular sort of service every man is to render as an individual's satisfaction during his term of service depends on his having an occupation to his taste parents and teachers watch from early years for indications of special aptitudes in children a thorough study of the national industrial system with the history and rudiments of all the great trades is an essential part of our educational system while manual training is not allowed to encroach on the general intellectual culture to which our schools are devoted it is carried far enough to give our youth in addition to their theoretical knowledge of the national industries mechanical and agricultural a certain familiarity with their tools and methods our schools are constantly visiting our workshops and often are taken on long excursions to inspect particular industrial enterprises in your day a man was not ashamed to be grossly ignorant of all trades except his own but such ignorance would not be consistent with our idea of placing every one in a position to select intelligently the occupation for which he has most taste usually long before he is mustered into service a young man has found out the pursuit he wants to follow has acquired a great deal of knowledge about it and is waiting impatiently the time when he can enlist in its ranks surely i said it can hardly be that the number of volunteers for any trade is exactly the number needed in that trade it must be generally either under or over the demand the supply of volunteers is always expected to fully equal the demand replied dr leete it is the business of the administration to see that this is the case the rate of volunteering for each trade is closely watched if there be a noticeably greater excess of volunteers over men needed in any trade it is inferred that the trade offers greater attractions than others on the other hand if the number of volunteers for a trade tends to drop below the demand it is inferred that it is thought more arduous it is the business of the administration to seek constantly to equalize the attractions of the trades so far as the conditions of labor in them are concerned so that all trades shall be equally attractive to persons having natural tastes for them this is done by making the hours of labor in different trades to differ according to their arduousness the lighter trades prosecuted under the most agreeable circumstances have in this way the longest hours while an arduous trade such as mining has very short hours there is no theory no a priori rule by which the respective attractiveness of industries is determined the administration in taking burdens off one class of workers and adding them to other classes simply follows the fluctuations of opinion among the workers themselves as indicated by the rate of volunteering the principle is that no man's work ought to be on the whole harder for him than any other man's for him the workers themselves to be the judges there are no limits to the application of this rule if any particular occupation is in itself so arduous or so oppressive that in order to induce volunteers the day's work in it had to be reduced to ten minutes it would be done if even then no man was willing to do it it would remain undone but of course in point of fact a moderate reduction in the hours of labor or addition of other privileges suffices to secure all needed volunteers for any occupation necessary to men if indeed the unavoidable difficulties and dangers of such a necessary pursuit were so great that no inducement of compensating advantages would overcome men's repugnance to it the administration would only need to take it out of the common order of occupations by declaring it extra hazardous and those who pursued it especially worthy of the national gratitude to be overrun with volunteers our young men are very greedy of honor and do not let slip such opportunities of course you will see that dependence on the purely voluntary choice of avocations involves the abolition in all of anything like unhygienic conditions or special peril to life and limb health and safety are conditions common to all industries the nation does not maim and slaughter its workmen by thousands as did the private capitalists and corporations of your day chapter ii during dinner both ruth and ethel were aware of some in the manner his was unusual and once ruth saw a faint smile that nothing evident could have induced unconsciously also he set a tone of constraint and hurry the meal was not loitered over the conversation flagged and all rose from the table with a sense of relief perhaps indeed with a feeling of expectation they entered the parlor together and the mastiff rose to meet them asking permission to remain with the little coaxing push of his nose which brought the ready answer certainly sultan make yourself comfortable then they grouped themselves round the fire and the judge lit his cigar and looked at ethel in a way that instantly brought curiosity to the question you have a secret father she said is it about grandmother it is news rather than a secret ethel and grandmother has a good deal to do with it for it is about her family the mostyns oh the tone of oh was not encouraging and look of interest held in abeyance was just as chilling but something like this attitude had been expected and judge rawdon was not discouraged by it he knew that youth is capable of great and sudden changes and that its ability to find reasonable motives for them is unlimited so he calmly continued you are aware that your name before marriage was rachel mostyn i have seen it a thousand times at the bottom of her sampler father the one that is framed and hanging in her morning room rachel mostyn november anno domini very well she married george rawdon and they came to new york in they had a pretty house on the bowling green and lived very happily there i was born in the youngest of their children you know that i sign my name edward m rawdon it is really edward mostyn rawdon he paused and ruth said i suppose mrs rawdon has had some news from her old home she had a letter last night and i shall probably receive one frederick mostyn her is coming to new york and squire rawdon of rawdon manor writes to recommend the young man to our hospitality but you surely do not intend to invite him here edward i think that would not do he is going to the holland house but he is our kinsman and therefore we must be hospitable i have been trying to count the kinship it is out of my reckoning said ethel i hope at least he is nice and presentable the mostyns are a handsome family look at your grandmother and squire rawdon speaks very well of mr mostyn he has taken the right side in politics and is likely to make his mark they were always great sportsmen and i dare say this representative of the family is a fellow and perfectly dressed ethel laughed if his clothes fit him he will be an english wonder i have seen lots of englishmen they are all frights as to trousers and vests there was lord wycomb his broadcloths and satins and linen were marvels in quality but the make the girls hated to be seen walking with him and he would walk good for the constitution was his explanation for all his peculiarities the caylers were weary to death of them and yet said ruth they sang songs of triumph when lou cayler married him that was a different thing lou would make him get fits and stop wearing sloppy baggy arrangements and i do not suppose the english lord has now a single peculiarity left unless it be his constitutional walk that of course i have heard english babies get out of their cradles to take a constitutional during this tirade ruth had been thinking edward she asked why does squire rawdon introduce mr mostyn their relationship cannot be worth counting there you are wrong ruth he spoke with a little excitement englishmen never deny matrimonial relationships if they are worthy ones mostyn and rawdon are bound together by many a gold wedding ring we reckon such ties relationships squire lost his son and his two grandsons a year ago perhaps this young man may eventually stand in their place the squire is nearly eighty years old he is the last of the english rawdons at least of our branch of it you suppose this mr mostyn may become squire of rawdon manor he may ruth but it is not certain there is a large mortgage on the manor oh both girls made the ejaculation at the same moment and in both voices there was the same curious tone of speculation it was a cry after truth apprehended but not realized mr rawdon remained silent he was debating with himself the advisability of further confidence but he came quickly to the conclusion that enough had been told for the present turning to ethel he said i suppose girls have a code of honor about their secrets is dora extraordinary news shut up in it oh no father she is going to be married that is all that is enough who is the man reverend mr stanhope nonsense positively i never heard anything more ridiculous that saintly young priest why dora will be tired to death of him in a month and he poor fellow chapter iii the dick jennings the was one of the few northern men who go to the south and throw aside their honest mode of obtaining a living and resort to trading in human beings a more person could scarcely be found in any community of bad looking men tall lean and lank with high face much pitted with the gray eyes with red eyebrows and sandy whiskers he indeed stood alone without mate or fellow in looks jennings prided himself upon what he called his goodness of heat and was always speaking of his humanity as many of the slaves whom he intended taking to the new orleans market had been raised in richmond and had relations there he determined to leave the city early in the morning so as not to witness any of the scenes so common on the departure of a to the far south in this he was most successful for not even isabella who had called at the prison several times to see her mother and sister was aware of the time that they were to leave the started at early dawn and was beyond the confines of the city long before the citizens were out of their beds as a slave regards a life on the sugar cotton or rice plantation as even worse than death they are ever on the watch for an opportunity to escape the trader aware of this secures his victims in chains before he sets out on his journey on this occasion jennings had the men chained in pairs while the women were allowed to go unfastened but were closely watched after a march of eight days the company arrived on the banks of the ohio river where they took a steamer for the place of their destination jennings had already advertised in the new orleans papers that he would be there with a prime lot of slaves men and women fit for with a few extra ones calculated for all between the ages of fifteen and years but like most men who make a business of speculating in human beings he often bought many who were far advanced in years and would try to pass them off for five or six years younger than they were few persons can arrive at anything approaching the real age of the negro by mere observation unless they are well acquainted with the race therefore the frequently carried out the deception with perfect impunity after the steamer had left the wharf and was fairly out on the bosom of the broad mississippi the speculator called his servant pompey to him and instructed him as to getting the negroes ready for market among the forty slaves that the trader had on this occasion were some whose appearance indicated that they had seen some years and had gone through considerable service their gray hair and whiskers at once pronounced them to be above the ages set down in the trader's advertisement pompey had long been with jennings and understood his business well and if he did not take delight in the discharge of his duty he did it at least with a degree of alacrity so that he might receive the approbation of his master pomp as he was usually called by the trader was of real negro blood and would often say when alluding to himself dis nigger am no counterfeit he is de ginuine artikle dis chile is none of your dere is no bogus about him pompey was of low stature round face and like most of his race had a set of teeth which for whiteness and beauty could not be surpassed his eyes were large lips thick and hair short and woolly pompey had been with jennings so long and had seen so much of buying and selling of his that he appeared perfectly indifferent to the scenes which daily occurred in his presence such is the force of habit vice is a monster of such frightful mien that to be hated needs but to be seen but seen too oft familiar with its face we first endure then pity then embrace it was on the second day of the steamer's voyage that pompey selected five of the oldest slaves took them into a room by themselves and commenced preparing them for the market now said he addressing himself to the company i is de chap dat is to get you ready for de orleans market so dat you will bring marser a good price how old is you addressing himself to a man not less than forty if i live to see next time i shall be either forty or i don't know which dat may be replied pompey but now you is only thirty years old dat's what marser says you is to be i know i is more den dat responded the man i can't help nuffin about dat returned pompey but when you get into de market and any one ax you how old you is and you tell um you is forty or marser will tie you up and cut you all to pieces but if you tell um dat you is only thirty den he won't now remember dat you is thirty years old and no more a week later i should have finished this letter long ago but i didn't you don't mind do you daddy if i'm not very regular i really do love to write to you it gives me such a respectable feeling of having some family would you like me to tell you something you are not the only man to whom i write letters there are two others i have been receiving beautiful long letters this winter from master jervie with typewritten envelopes so julia won't recognize the writing did you ever hear anything so shocking and every week or so a very scrawly epistle usually on yellow tablet paper arrives from princeton all of which i answer with promptness so you see i am not so different from other girls i get letters too did i tell you that i have been elected a member of the senior dramatic club very recherche organization only members out of one thousand do you think as a consistent socialist that i ought to belong what do you suppose is at present engaging my attention in sociology i am writing figurez vous a paper on the care of dependent children the professor shuffled up his subjects and dealt them out promiscuously and that fell to me c'est drole ca n'est pas there goes the gong for dinner i'll post this as i pass the box affectionately j june dear daddy very busy time commencement in ten days examinations tomorrow lots of studying lots of packing and the outdoor world so lovely that it hurts you to stay inside but never mind vacation's coming julia is going abroad this summer it makes the fourth time no doubt about it daddy goods are not distributed evenly sallie as usual goes to the adirondacks and what do you think i am going to do you may have three guesses lock willow wrong the adirondacks with sallie wrong i'll never attempt that again i was discouraged last year can't you guess anything else you're not very inventive i'll tell you daddy if you'll promise not to make a lot of objections i warn your secretary in advance that my mind is made up i am going to spend the summer at the seaside with a mrs charles paterson and tutor her daughter who is to enter college in the autumn i met her through the mcbrides and she is a very charming woman i am to give lessons in english and latin to the younger daughter too but i shall have a little time to myself and i shall be earning fifty dollars a month doesn't that impress you as a perfectly exorbitant amount she offered it i should have blushed to ask for more than i finish at magnolia that's where she lives the first of september and shall probably spend the remaining three weeks at lock willow i should like to see the semples again and all the friendly animals how does my programme strike you daddy i am getting quite independent you see you have put me on my feet and i think i can almost walk alone by now princeton commencement and our examinations exactly coincide which is an awful blow sallie and i did so want to get away in time for it but of course that is utterly impossible goodbye daddy have a nice summer and come back in the autumn rested and ready for another year of work that's what you ought to be writing to me i haven't any idea what you do in the summer or how you amuse yourself i can't visualize your surroundings do you play golf or hunt or ride horseback or just sit in the sun and meditate anyway whatever it is have a good time and don't forget judy june dear daddy this is the hardest letter i ever wrote but i have decided what i must do and there isn't going to be any turning back it is very sweet and generous and dear of you to wish to send me to europe this summer for the moment i was intoxicated by the idea but sober second thoughts said no it would be rather illogical of me to refuse to take your money for college and then use it instead just for amusement you mustn't get me used to too many luxuries one doesn't miss what one has never had but it's awfully hard going without things after one has commenced thinking they are his hers english language needs another pronoun by natural right living with sallie and julia is an awful strain on my stoical philosophy they have both had things from the time they were babies they accept happiness as a matter of course the world they think owes them everything they want maybe the world does in any case it seems to acknowledge the debt and pay up but as for me it owes me nothing and distinctly told me so in the beginning i have no right to borrow on credit for there will come a time when the world will repudiate my claim i seem to be floundering in a sea of metaphor but i hope you grasp my meaning anyway i have a very strong feeling that the only honest thing for me to do is to teach this summer and begin to support myself i the nellie a cruising yawl swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails and was at rest the flood had made the wind was nearly calm and being bound down the river the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide the of the thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway in the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked with gleams of varnished sprits a haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness the air was dark above gravesend and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom brooding motionless over the biggest and the greatest town on earth the director of companies was our captain and our host we four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward on the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical he resembled a pilot which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified it was difficult to realize his work was not out there in the luminous estuary but behind him within the brooding gloom between us there was as i have already said somewhere the bond of the sea besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's yarns and even convictions the lawyer the best of old fellows had because of his many years and many virtues the only cushion on deck and was lying on the only rug the accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes and was toying architecturally with the bones marlow sat right aft leaning against the he had sunken cheeks a yellow complexion a straight back an ascetic aspect and with his arms dropped the palms of hands outwards resembled an idol the director satisfied the anchor had good hold made his way aft and sat down amongst us we exchanged a few words lazily afterwards there was silence on board the yacht for some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes we felt meditative and fit for nothing but placid staring the day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance the water shone pacifically the sky without a speck was a benign immensity of unstained light the very mist on the essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric hung from the wooded rises inland and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds only the gloom to the west brooding over the upper reaches became more somber every minute as if angered by the approach of the sun and at last in its curved and imperceptible fall the sun sank low and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat as if about to go out suddenly stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men forthwith a change came over the waters and the serenity became less brilliant but more profound the old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline of day after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth we looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever but in the august light of abiding memories and indeed nothing is easier for a man who has as the phrase goes followed the sea with reverence and affection than to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the thames the tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea it had known and served all the men of whom the nation is proud from sir francis drake to sir john franklin knights all titled and untitled the great of the sea it had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time from the golden hind returning with her round flanks full of treasure to be visited by the queen's highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale to the erebus and terror bound on other conquests and that never returned it had known the ships and the men they had sailed from deptford from greenwich from erith the adventurers and the settlers kings ships and the ships of men on change captains admirals the dark interlopers of the eastern trade and the commissioned generals of east india fleets hunters for gold or pursuers of fame they all had gone out on that stream bearing the sword and often the torch messengers of the might within the land bearers of a spark from the sacred fire what greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth the dreams of men the seed of commonwealths the germs of empires chapter iii mrs morgan wife of a judge of the high court of bombay and i sat amidships on the cool side in the suez canal she was outlining soiled linen in on a green canvas bag i was admiring the egyptian sands how charming said i is this solitary desert in the endless oasis we are compelled to cross oasis in the desert you mean said mrs morgan i noticed any but i happened to look up this morning as i was putting on my stockings and i saw through my the most lovely mirage i had been at school with mrs morgan more than twenty years agone but she had come to the special enjoyment of the dignities of life while i still liked doing things mrs morgan was the kind of person to make one realize how distressing a medium is middle age contemplating her precipitous lap to which conventional attitudes were certainly more becoming i crossed my own knees with energy and once more resolved to be young until i was old how perfectly delightful for you to be taking cecily out said mrs morgan placidly it i responded watching the gliding sands but she was born in that makes her quite time i should say oh we put it off any longer i mean her father has such a horror of early debuts he simply would not hear of her coming before want her to marry in india i dare say the only one purred mrs morgan oh i know it such a bad place i was brought out there to marry and i married found it very satisfactory you always did say exactly what you thought helena said mrs morgan excusingly i much patience with people who bring their daughters out to give them the chance they never would have in england and then go about devoutly hoping they marry in india i said i shall be very pleased if cecily does as well as your girls have done mary in the indian civil and jessie in the imperial service troops sighed mrs morgan complacently and both my dear within a year it was a blow oh it must have been i said civilly there was no use in bandying words with emily morgan there is nothing in the world like the satisfaction and pleasure one takes in daughters mrs morgan went on limpidly and one can be in such close sympathy with girls i have never regretted having no sons dear me yes to watch oneself growing up again call back the lovely april of prime etcetera to read every thought and anticipate every wish there is no more golden privilege in life dear emily such a direct and natural avenue for affection such a wide field for interest i paused lost in the volume of my admirable sentiments how beautifully you talk helena i wish i had the gift it mean very much i said truthfully oh i think everything and how companionable a girl is i quite envy you this season having cecily constantly with you and taking her about everywhere something quite new for you it absolutely said i i am looking forward to it immensely but it is likely she will make her own friends you think i added anxiously hardly the first season my girls i was practically their only intimate for months be afraid you be obliged to go shares in cecily with anybody for a good long while added mrs morgan kindly i know just how you feel about that the muddy water of the ditch chafed up from under us against its banks with a smell that enabled me to hide the emotions mrs morgan evoked behind my handkerchief the pale desert was pictorial with the drifting deepening purple shadows of clouds and in the midst a blue glimmer of the bitter lakes with a white sail on them a little frantic arab boy ran alongside keeping pace with the ship except for the smell it was like a dream we moved so quietly on gently on and on between the ridgy clay banks and the rows of piles peace was on the ship you could hear what the fourth in his white ducks said to the quartermaster in his blue denims you could count the strokes of the electric bell in the peace was on the ship as she pushed on an impertinence through the sands of the ages my eyes wandered along a in the deck till they were arrested by a petticoat i knew when they returned of their own accord i seemed to be always seeing that petticoat i think resumed mrs morgan whose glance had wandered in the same direction that cecily is a very fine type of our english girls with those dark grey eyes a little prominent possibly and that good colour rather high now perhaps but she will lose quite enough of it in india and those regular features she would make a splendid britannia do you know i fancy she must have a great deal of character has she any amount and all of it good i responded with private dejection song in every heart to find a slave in every soul to fix his reign in bonds to lead the wise and brave and make the captives kiss his chain such is the power of love and oh i grieve so well love's power to know in sighs to pass the day to taste a short and broken sleep for one dear object far away all others scorned to watch and weep such are the pains of love and oh i grieve so well love's pains to know to read consent in virgin eyes to press the lip ne'er prest till then to hear the sigh of transport rise and kiss and kiss and kiss again such are thy pleasures love but oh when shall my heart thy pleasures know chorus now hush my lyre my voice be still sleep gentle maid may fond desire with amorous thoughts thy visions fill though still my voice and hushed my lyre the music ceased the performers dispersed and silence prevailed through the street antonia quitted the window with regret she as usual recommended herself to the protection of st rosolia said her accustomed prayers and retired to bed sleep was not long absent and his presence relieved her from her terrors and inquietude it was almost two o'clock before the lustful monk ventured to bend his steps towards antonia's dwelling it has been already mentioned that the abbey was at no great distance from the strada di san iago he reached the house unobserved here he stopped and hesitated for a moment he reflected on the enormity of the crime the consequences of a discovery and the probability after what had passed of elvira's suspecting him to be her daughter's ravisher on the other hand it was suggested that she could do no more than suspect that no proofs of his guilt could be produced that it would seem impossible for the rape to have been committed without antonia's knowing when where or by whom and finally he believed that his fame was too firmly established to be shaken by the unsupported accusations of two unknown women this latter argument was perfectly false he knew not how uncertain is the air of popular applause and that a moment suffices to make him today the detestation of the world who yesterday was its idol the result of the monk's deliberations was that he should proceed in his enterprize he ascended the steps leading to the house no sooner did he touch the door with the silver myrtle than it flew open and presented him with a free passage he entered and the door closed after him of its own accord guided by the moonbeams he proceeded up the staircase with slow and cautious steps he looked round him every moment with apprehension and anxiety he saw a spy in every shadow and heard a voice in every murmur of the night breeze consciousness of the guilty business on which he was employed appalled his heart and rendered it more timid than a woman's yet still he proceeded he reached the door of antonia's chamber he stopped and listened all was hushed within the total silence persuaded him that his intended victim was retired to rest and he ventured to lift up the latch the door was fastened and resisted his efforts but no sooner was it touched by the talisman than the bolt flew back the ravisher stept on and found himself in the chamber where slept the innocent girl unconscious how dangerous a visitor was drawing near her couch the door closed after him and the bolt shot again into its fastening ambrosio advanced with precaution he took care that not a board should creak under his foot and held in his breath as he approached the bed his first attention was to perform the magic ceremony as matilda had charged him he breathed thrice upon the silver myrtle pronounced over it antonia's name and laid it upon her pillow the effects which it had already produced permitted not his doubting its success in prolonging the slumbers of his devoted mistress no sooner was the enchantment performed than he considered her to be absolutely in his power and his eyes flamed with lust and impatience he now ventured to cast a glance upon the sleeping beauty a single lamp burning before the statue of st rosolia shed a faint light through the room and permitted him to examine all the charms of the lovely object before him the heat of the weather had obliged her to throw off part of the those which still covered her ambrosio's insolent hand hastened to remove she lay with her cheek reclining upon one ivory arm the other rested on the side of the bed with graceful indolence a few tresses of her hair had escaped from beneath the muslin which confined the rest and fell carelessly over her bosom as it heaved with slow and regular suspiration the warm air had spread her cheek with higher colour than usual a smile inexpressibly sweet played round her ripe and coral lips from which every now and then escaped a gentle sigh or an sentence an air of enchanting innocence and candour pervaded her whole form and there was a sort of modesty in her very nakedness which added fresh stings to the desires of the lustful monk the adventure of the solitary cyclist from the years to inclusive mr sherlock holmes was a very busy man it is safe to say that there was no public case of any difficulty in which he was not consulted during those eight years and there were hundreds of private cases some of them of the most intricate and extraordinary character in which he played a prominent part many startling successes and a few unavoidable failures were the outcome of this long period of continuous work as i have preserved very full notes of all these cases and was myself personally engaged in many of them it may be imagined that it is no easy task to know which i should select to lay before the public i shall however preserve my former rule and give the preference to those cases which derive their interest not so much from the brutality of the crime as from the ingenuity and dramatic quality of the solution for this reason i will now lay before the reader the facts connected with miss violet smith the solitary cyclist of charlington and the curious sequel of our investigation which culminated in unexpected tragedy it is true that the circumstance did not admit of any striking illustration of those powers for which my friend was famous but there were some points about the case which made it stand out in those long records of crime from which i gather the material for these little narratives on referring to my notebook for the year i find that it was upon saturday the of april that we first heard of miss violet smith her visit was i remember extremely unwelcome to holmes for he was immersed at the moment in a very abstruse and complicated problem concerning the peculiar persecution to which john vincent harden the tobacco millionaire had been subjected my friend who loved above all things precision and concentration of thought resented anything which distracted his attention from the matter in hand and yet without a harshness which was foreign to his nature it was impossible to refuse to listen to the story of the young and beautiful woman tall graceful and queenly who presented herself at baker street late in the evening and implored his assistance and advice it was vain to urge that his time was already fully occupied for the young lady had come with the determination to tell her story and it was evident that nothing short of force could get her out of the room until she had done so with a resigned air and a somewhat weary smile holmes begged the beautiful intruder to take a seat and to inform us what it was that was troubling her at least it cannot be your health said he as his keen eyes darted over her so ardent a bicyclist must be full of energy she glanced down in surprise at her own feet and i observed the slight roughening of the side of the sole caused by the friction of the edge of the pedal yes i bicycle a good deal mr holmes and that has something to do with my visit to you my friend took the ungloved hand and examined it with as close an attention and as little sentiment as a scientist would show to a specimen you will excuse me i am sure it is my business said he as he dropped it i nearly fell into the error of supposing that you were typewriting of course it is obvious that it is music you observe the spatulate watson which is common to both professions there is a spirituality about the face however she gently turned it towards the light which the typewriter does not generate this lady is a musician yes mr holmes i teach music in the country i presume from your complexion yes sir near farnham on the borders of surrey a beautiful neighbourhood and full of the most interesting associations you remember watson that it was near there that we took archie stamford the forger now miss violet what has happened to you near farnham on the borders of surrey the young lady with great clearness and composure made the following curious statement my father is dead mr holmes he was james smith who conducted the orchestra at the old imperial theatre my mother and i were left without a relation in the world except one uncle ralph smith who went to africa years ago and we have never had a word from him since when father died we were left very poor but one day we were told that there was an advertisement in the times inquiring for our whereabouts you can imagine how excited we were for we thought that someone had left us a fortune we went at once to the lawyer whose name was given in the paper there we met two gentlemen mr carruthers and mr woodley who were home on a visit from south africa they said that my uncle was a friend of theirs that he had died some months before in great poverty in johannesburg and that he had asked them with his last breath to hunt up his relations and see that they were in no want it seemed strange to us that uncle ralph who took no notice of us when he was alive should be so careful to look after us when he was dead but mr carruthers explained that the reason was that my uncle had just heard of the death of his brother and so felt responsible for our fate vi but he did not stay away he owned and lived in a small house up on the rumson road while the house was little more than a bungalow and had a simplicity that completely hid its rare good taste from the average observer its grounds were the most spacious in that neighborhood of costly showy houses set in grounds not much more extensive than a city building lot the grounds had been cleared and drained to drive out and to keep out the obnoxious insect life but had been left a forest concealing the house from the roads stanley baird was now stopping with keith and brought him along to the cottage by the sea every day the parties narrowed to the same four persons mrs brindley seemed never to tire of talking to keith or to tire of talking about him when the two men had left late each night as for stanley he referred everything to keith the weather prospects where they should go for the day what should be eaten and drunk any point about politics or fashion life or literature or what not that happened to be discussed and he looked upon donald's monosyllabic reply to his inquiry as a final judgment ending all possibility of argument mildred held out long then in spite of herself she began to yield ceased to dislike him found a kind of pleasure or perhaps fascinated interest in the nervousness his silent and indifferent presence caused her she liked to watch that immobile perfect profile neither young nor old indeed not suggesting age in any degree but only experience and knowledge and an infinite capacity for emotion for passion even the color declared it had already been lived the brilliant usually averted or veiled eyes asserted present vitality pulsing under a calm surface one day when stanley in the manner of one who wishes a thing settled and settled right said he would ask donald keith about it mildred a little piqued a little amused retorted and what will he answer why simply yes or no that's all assented stanley and that's quite enough isn't it but how do you know he's as wise as he pretends he doesn't pretend to be anything or to know anything that's precisely it mildred suddenly began to like keith she had never thought of this before yes it was true he did not pretend not in the least not about anything when you saw him you saw at once the worst there was to see it was afterward that you discovered he was not slovenly but clean and neat not badly but well dressed not homely but handsome not sickly but soundly well not physically weak but strong not dull but vividly alive not a tiresome void but an unfathomable mystery what does he do she asked mrs brindley cyrilla's usually positive gray eyes looked vague she smiled i never asked said she i've known him nearly three years and it never occurred to me to ask or to wonder isn't that strange usually about the first inquiry we make is what a man does i'll ask stanley said mildred and she did about an hour later when they were in the surf together with the other two out of earshot said stanley he's a lawyer of course also he's written a novel or two and a book of poems i've never read them somehow i never get around to reading oh he's a lawyer that's the way he makes his living a queer kind of lawyer he never goes to court and his clients are almost all other lawyers they go to him to get him to tell them what to do and what not to do he's got a big reputation among lawyers fred norman tells me but makes comparatively little as he either can't or won't charge what he ought i told him what norman said and he only smiled in that queer way he has i said you make twenty or thirty thousand a year you ought to make ten times that and what did he answer asked mildred nothing he said i make all i want if i took in more i'd be bothered getting rid of it or investing it i can always make all i'll want unless i go crazy and what could a crazy man do with money it doesn't cost anything to live in a lunatic asylum several items of interest to add to those she had collected he could talk brilliantly but he preferred silence he could make himself attractive to women and to men but he preferred to be detached he could be a great lawyer but he preferred the quiet of obscurity he could be a rich man but he preferred to be comparatively poor said mildred i suppose some woman some disappointment in love has killed ambition and everything like that i don't think so replied baird the men who knew him as a boy say he was always as he is now he lived in the arabian desert for two years why didn't he stay laughed mildred that life would exactly suit him it did said stanley but his father died and he had to come home and support his mother until she died that's the way his whole life has been he drifts in the current of circumstances he might let himself be blown away to the other end of the earth and stay away years or never come back chapter v for the next two hours thorpe's thoughts were almost wholly occupied with various phases of the large subject of domestic service he seemed suddenly to have been transported to some region populated exclusively by men in brown livery one of these was holding a spirited horse outside the station and when lord plowden had taken the reins and thorpe had gathered the rugs about his knees and feet this menial silently associated himself with the young man who had accompanied them from town on the back seat of the trap with these people so close behind him thorpe felt that any intimate conversation was out of the question indeed talk of any sort was not invited the big horse burst forth with high sprawling strides upon a career through the twilight once the main road was reached which it taxed all plowden's energies to regulate he kept up a continual murmuring monologue to the animal so so quiet my pet sosoeasy my beauty so so and his wrists and gloved hands were visibly under a tremendous tension of strain as they held their own against the rigid arched neck and mouth of steel thorpe kept a grip on the side of the trap and had only a modified pleasure in the drive the road along which they sped seemed in the gathering dusk uncomfortably narrow and he speculated a good deal as to how frightened the two mutes behind him must be but silence was such a law of their life that though he strained his ears he could not so much as hear them sigh or gasp it seemed but a very few minutes before they turned off with but the most fleeting diminution of pace upon a private road which speedily developed into an avenue of trees quite dark and apparently narrower than ever down this they raced precipitately and then coming out all at once upon an open space swung smartly round the crescent of a gravel road and halted before what seemed to be the door of a greenhouse thorpe as he stood up in the trap got an uncertain general idea of a low mansion in the background with lights showing behind curtains in several widely separated windows what he had taken to be a conservatory revealed itself now to be a glass gallery built along the front of the central portion of this house a profusion of hospitable lights tall in brackets among the vines against the trellised wall gave to this outlying entrance what the stranger felt to be a delightful effect its smooth tiled floor comfortably bestrewn with rugs was on a level with the path outside there were low here and a little wicker table bearing books and a lady's further on giant chrysanthemum blooms were massed beneath the clusters of pale on the trellis directly in front across the dozen feet of this glazed vestibule the broad doorway of the house proper stood open with warm lights glowing richly upon dark woods in the luxurious obscurity within what thorpe noted most of all however was the servants who seemed to swarm everywhere the two who had alighted from the trap had contrived somehow mysteriously to multiply themselves in the darkness all at once there were a number of young men at the horse's head at the back and sides of the trap at the first doorway and the second and beyond each presenting such a pallid replica of all the others that thorpe knew he should never be able to tell them apart lord plowden paused for a moment under the to look at his watch we did it in a bit over eight minutes he remarked with obvious satisfaction with four people and heavy roads that's not so bad not so bad but come inside they moved forward through the wide doorway into an apartment the like of which thorpe had not seen before it was a large square room with a big staircase at the end which separated and went off to right and left up its visible course its floor was of inlaid woods old and uneven from long use and carpeted here and there by the skins of tigers and leopards there were many other suggestions of the chase about the room riding boots whips spurs and some stands of archaic weapons caught the eye at various points the heads of foxes and deer peeped out on the blackened panels of the walls from among clusters of hooks crowded with coats hats and mackintoshes at the right where a fire glowed and blazed under a huge open there were low chairs and divans drawn up to mark off a space for orderly domestic occupation the irregularity of every thing outside the great table in the centre of the hall strewn with an incongruous litter of caps books flasks newspapers gloves the shoes slippers and leggings scattered under the benches at the sides all this disorder of a careless household struck thorpe with a profound surprise it was like nothing so much as a mexican ranch and to find it in the ancestral home of an english nobleman filled to overflowing with servants amazed him the glances that he cast about him however were impassive enough his mind was charged with the ceaseless responsibility of being astonished at nothing a man took his hat and helped him off with his coat another moved toward the staircase with his two bags xxv when the weather was dark and cloudy edna could not work she needed the sun to mellow and temper her mood to the sticking point she had reached a stage when she seemed to be no longer feeling her way working when in the humor with sureness and ease and being devoid of ambition and striving not toward accomplishment she drew satisfaction from the work in itself on rainy or melancholy days edna went out and sought the society of the friends she had made at grand isle or else she stayed indoors and nursed a mood with which she was becoming too familiar for her own comfort and peace of mind it was not despair but it seemed to her as if life were passing by leaving its promise broken and unfulfilled yet there were other days when she listened was led on and deceived by fresh promises which her youth held out to her she went again to the races and again alcee arobin and mrs highcamp called for her one bright afternoon in arobin's drag mrs highcamp was a worldly but unaffected intelligent slim tall blonde woman in the forties with an indifferent manner and blue eyes that stared she had a daughter who served her as a pretext for cultivating the society of young men of fashion alcee arobin was one of them he was a familiar figure at the race course the opera the fashionable clubs there was a perpetual smile in his eyes which seldom failed to awaken a corresponding cheerfulness in any one who looked into them and listened to his voice his manner was quiet and at times a little insolent he possessed a good figure a pleasing face not overburdened with depth of thought or feeling and his dress was that of the conventional man of fashion he admired edna extravagantly after meeting her at the races with her father he had met her before on other occasions but she had seemed to him unapproachable until that day it was at his instigation that mrs highcamp called to ask her to go with them to the jockey club to witness the turf event of the season there were possibly a few track men out there who knew the race horse as well as edna but there was certainly none who knew it better she sat between her two companions as one having authority to speak she laughed at arobin's pretensions and deplored mrs highcamp's ignorance the race horse was a friend and intimate associate of her childhood the atmosphere of the stables and the breath of the blue grass paddock revived in her memory and lingered in her nostrils she did not perceive that she was talking like her father as the sleek geldings ambled in review before them she played for very high stakes and fortune favored her the fever of the game flamed in her cheeks and eyes and it got into her blood and into her brain like an intoxicant people turned their heads to look at her and more than one lent an attentive ear to her utterances hoping thereby to secure the elusive but tip arobin caught the contagion of excitement which drew him to edna like a magnet mrs highcamp remained as usual unmoved with her indifferent stare and uplifted eyebrows edna stayed and dined with mrs highcamp upon being urged to do so arobin also remained and sent away his drag the dinner was quiet and uninteresting save for the cheerful efforts of arobin to enliven things mrs highcamp deplored the absence of her daughter from the races and tried to convey to her what she had missed by going to the dante reading instead of joining them the girl held a geranium leaf up to her nose and said nothing but looked knowing and noncommittal mr highcamp was a plain man who only talked under compulsion he was unresponsive mrs highcamp was full of delicate courtesy and consideration toward her husband she addressed most of her conversation to him at table they sat in the library after dinner and read the evening papers together under the droplight while the younger people went into the near by and talked miss highcamp played some selections from grieg upon the piano she seemed to have apprehended all of the composer's coldness and none of his poetry while edna listened she could not help wondering if she had lost her taste for music when the time came for her to go home mr highcamp grunted a lame offer to escort her looking down at his slippered feet with tactless concern it was arobin who took her home the car ride was long and it was late when they reached esplanade street arobin asked permission to enter for a second to light his cigarette his match safe was empty he filled his match safe but did not light his cigarette until he left her after she had expressed her willingness to go to the races with him again edna was neither tired nor sleepy she was hungry again for the highcamp dinner though of excellent quality had lacked abundance she rummaged in the larder and brought forth a slice of gruyere and some crackers she opened a bottle of beer which she found in the icebox edna felt extremely restless and excited she vacantly hummed a fantastic

childhood through the ages for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic marvelous and manifestly unreal the winged fairies of grimm and andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations yet the old time fairy tale having served for generations may now be classed as historical in the children's library for the time has come for a series of newer wonder tales in which the stereotyped genie dwarf and fairy are eliminated together with all the horrible and incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale modern education includes morality therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident having this thought in mind the story of the wonderful wizard of oz was written solely to please children of today it aspires to being a modernized fairy tale in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out l frank baum chicago april the wonderful wizard of oz the cyclone dorothy lived in the midst of the great kansas prairies with uncle henry who was a farmer and aunt em who was the farmer's wife their house was small for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles there were four walls a floor and a roof which made one room and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove a cupboard for the dishes a table three or four chairs and the beds uncle henry and aunt em had a big bed in one corner and dorothy a little bed in another corner there was no garret at all and no cellar except a small hole dug in the ground called a cyclone cellar where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose mighty enough to crush any building in its path it was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor from which a ladder led down into the small dark hole when dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions the sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass with little cracks running through it even the grass was not green for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere once the house had been painted but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else when aunt em came there to live she was a young pretty wife the sun and wind had changed her too they had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips and they were gray also she was thin and gaunt and never smiled now when dorothy who was an orphan first came to her aunt em had been so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever dorothy's merry voice reached her ears and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at uncle henry never laughed he worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was he was gray also from his long beard to his rough boots and he looked stern and solemn and rarely spoke it was toto that made dorothy laugh and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings toto was not gray he was a little black dog with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny wee nose toto played all day long and dorothy played with him and loved him dearly today however they were not playing uncle henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky which was even grayer than usual dorothy stood in the door with toto in her arms and looked at the sky too aunt em was washing the dishes chapter xiv wessex gets busy innes rose from the chair usually occupied by paul harley as detective inspector wessex with a very blank face walked into the office innes looked haggard and exhibited unmistakable signs of anxiety since he had received that dramatic telephone message from his chief he had not spared himself for a moment the official machinery of scotland yard was at work endeavouring to trace the missing man but since it had proved impossible to find out from where the message had been sent the investigation was handicapped at the very outset close inquiries at the savoy hotel had shown that harley had not been there wessex who was a thorough artist within his limitations had satisfied himself that none of the callers who had asked for ormuz khan and no one who had loitered about the lobbies could possibly have been even a disguised paul harley to inspector wessex the lines along which paul harley was operating remained a matter of profound amazement and mystification his interview with mr nicol brinn had only served to baffle him more hopelessly than ever the nature of paul inquiries inquiries which presumably from the death of sir charles abingdon had led him to investigate the movements of two persons of international repute neither apparently having even the most remote connection with anything crooked was a conundrum for the answer to which the detective inspector sought in vain i can see you have no news said innes dully to be perfectly honest replied wessex i feel like a man who is walking in his sleep except for the extraordinary words uttered by the late sir charles abingdon i fail to see that there is any possible connection between his death and mr nicol brinn i simply fathom what mr harley was working upon to my mind there is not the slightest evidence of foul play in the case there is no motive apart from which there is absolutely no link nevertheless replied innes slowly you know the chief and therefore you know as well as i do that he would not have instructed me to communicate with you unless he had definite evidence in his possession it is perfectly clear that he was interrupted in the act of telephoning he was literally dragged away from the instrument i agree said wessex he had got into a tight corner somewhere right enough but where does nicol brinn come in how did he receive your communication oh it took him fairly between the eyes there is no denying that he knows something what he knows said innes slowly is what mr harley learned last night and what he fears is what has actually befallen the chief detective inspector wessex stood beside the burmese cabinet restlessly drumming his fingers upon its lacquered surface i am grateful for one thing he said the press has not got hold of this story they need never get hold of it if you are moderately careful for several reasons i am going to be more than moderately careful whatever may be its other name is sudden death a devil of a business a perfect nightmare but he paused i am wondering what on earth induced mr harley to send that parcel of linen to the analyst the result of the analysis may prove that the chief was not engaged upon any chase by heavens wessex sprang up his eyes brightened and he reached for his hat that gives me an idea the message with the parcel was written upon paper bearing the letterhead of the late sir charles abingdon so mr harley evidently made his first call there off sir the trail starts from that house leaving innes seated at the big table with an expression of despair upon his face detective inspector wessex set out he blamed himself for wasting time upon the obvious for concentrating too closely upon the clue given by last words to innes before leaving the office in chancery lane it was poor workmanship he had hoped to take a short cut and it had proved as usual to be a long one now as he sat in a laggard cab feeling that every minute wasted might be a matter of life and death he suddenly became conscious of personal anxiety he was a courageous indeed a fearless man and he was subconsciously surprised to find himself repeating the words of nicol brinn be careful be very careful with all the ardour of the professional he longed to find a clue which should lead him to the heart of the mystery innes had frankly outlined the whole of paul case to date and detective inspector wessex although he had not admitted the fact had nevertheless recognized that from start to finish the thing did not offer one single line of inquiry which he would have been capable of following up that paul harley had found material to work upon had somehow picked up a definite clue from this cloudy maze earned the envious admiration of the scotland yard man arrived at his destination he asked to see miss abingdon and was shown by the butler into a charmingly furnished little sitting room which was deeply impressed with the personality of its dainty owner it was essentially and delightfully feminine yet in the decorations and in the arrangement of the furniture there was a note of independence which was almost a note of defiance phyllis abingdon an appealingly pathetic figure in her black dress rose to greet the inspector chapter iii the great was filled with guests this apartment had three naves like a basilica which were separated by columns of sandalwood whose capitals were of sculptured bonze on each side of the apartment was a gallery for spectators and a third with a facade of gold filigree was at one end opposite an immense arch at the other the candelabra burning on the tables which were spread the whole length of the glowed like clusters of flaming flowers among the painted cups the plates of shining copper the cubes of snow and heaps of luscious grapes through the large windows the guests could see lighted torches on the terraces of the neighbouring houses for this night antipas was giving a feast to his friends his own people and to anyone that presented himself at the castle the slaves alert as dogs glided about noiselessly in felt sandals carrying dishes to and fro the table of the proconsul was placed beneath the gilded balcony upon a platform of sycamore wood rich tapestries from babylon were hung about the pavilion giving a certain effect of seclusion upon three ivory couches one facing the great hall and the other two placed one on either side of the pavilion reclined vitellius his son aulus and antipas the proconsul being near the door at the left aulus on the right the tetrarch occupying the middle couch antipas wore a heavy black mantle the texture of which was almost hidden by coloured embroideries and glittering decorations his beard was spread out like a fan blue powder had been scattered over his hair and on his head rested a diadem covered with precious stones vitellius still wore the purple band the emblem of his rank crossed diagonally over a linen toga aulus had tied behind his back the sleeves of his violet robe embroidered with silver his clustering curls were laid in carefully arranged rows a necklace of sapphires gleamed against his throat plump and white as that of a woman crouched upon a rug near him with legs crossed was a pretty white boy upon whose face shone a perpetual smile aulus had found him somewhere among the kitchens and had taken a violent fancy to him he had made the child one of his suite but as he never could remember his chaldean name called him simply the asiatic from time to time the little fellow sprang up and played about the and his antics appeared to amuse the guests at one side of the pavilion were the tables at which were seated his priests and officers also a number of persons from jerusalem and the more important men from the grecian cities at the table on the left of the proconsul sat marcellus with the publicans several friends of the tetrarch and various representatives from cana ptolemais and jericho seated at other tables were mountaineers from liban and many of the old soldiers of army a dozen thracians a greek and two germans besides huntsmen and herdsmen the sultan of palmyra and sailors from eziongaber before each guest was placed a roll of soft bread upon which to wipe the fingers as soon as they were seated hands were stretched out with the eagerness of a claws seizing upon olives pistachios and almonds every face was joyous every head was crowned with flowers except those of the pharisees who refused to wear the wreaths regarding them as a symbol of roman voluptuousness and vice they shuddered when the attendants sprinkled them with galburnum and incense the use of which the pharisees reserved strictly for services in the temple antipas observed that aulus rubbed himself under the arms as if annoyed by heat or chafing and promised to give him three flasks of the same kind of precious balm that had been used by cleopatra a captain from the garrison of tiberias who had just arrived placed himself behind the tetrarch as protection in case any unexpected trouble should arise but his attention was divided between observing the movements of the proconsul and listening to the conversation of his neighbours there was naturally much talk of iaokanann and other men of his stamp it is said remarked one of the guests that simon of gitta washed away his sins in fire and a certain man called jesus he is the worst of them all interrupted eleazar a miserable imposter at this a man sprang up from a table near the pavilion and made his way towards the place where eleazar sat his face was almost as pale as his linen robe but he addressed the pharisees boldly saying that is a lie jesus has performed miracles antipas expressed a desire to see the man jesus perform some of his miracles you should have brought him with you he said to the last speaker who was still standing tell us what you know about him he commanded then the stranger said that he himself whose name was jacob having a daughter who was very ill had gone to capernaum to implore the master to heal his child the master had answered him saying return to thy home she is healed and he had found his daughter standing at the threshold of his house having risen from her couch when the gnomon had marked the third hour the same moment when he had made his supplication to jesus authorities a novelist is not usually asked like a historian for his quellen as i have however judging from certain experiences in the past some reason to anticipate such a demand i wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to mr admirable history of travel through masai land for much information as to the habits and customs of the tribes inhabiting that portion of the east coast and the country where they live also to my brother john g haggard rn consul at madagascar and formerly consul at lamu for many details furnished by him of the mode of life and war of those engaging people the masai also to my mrs john haggard who kindly put the lines of p into rhyme for me also to an extract in a review from some book of travel of which i cannot recollect the name to which i owe the idea of the great crabs in the valley of the subterranean river endnote but if i remember right the crabs in the book when irritated projected their eyes quite out of their heads i regret that i was not able to plagiarize this effect but i felt that although crabs may and doubtless do behave thus in real life in romance they will not do so there is an underground river in peter wilkins but at the time of writing the foregoing pages i had not read that quaint but entertaining work it has been pointed out to me that there exists a similarity between the scene of umslopogaas frightening alphonse with his axe and a scene in far from the madding crowd i regret this coincidence and believe that the talented author of that work will not be inclined to accuse me of literary immorality on its account finally i may say that mr little frenchman appears to belong to the same class of beings as those english ladies whose long yellow teeth and feet of enormous size excite our hearty amusement in the pages of the illustrated gallic press the writer of allan quatermain endnote among the zulus a man assumes the ring which is made of a species of black

allan quatermain misquotes pleasure sat at the helm editor endnote where alph the sacred river ran through caverns measureless to man down to a sunless sea endnote mr quatermain does not seem to have been aware that it is common for people to annually sacrifice the beasts they adore see herodotus ii editor endnote there is another theory which might account for the origin of the which does not seem to have struck my friend mr quatermain and his companions and that is that they are descendants of the phoenicians the cradle of the phoenician race is supposed to have been on the western shore of the persian gulf thence as there is good evidence to show they emigrated in two streams one of which took possession of the shores of palestine while the other is supposed by savants to have immigrated down the coast of eastern africa where near mozambique signs and remains of their occupation are not wanting indeed it would have been very extraordinary if they did not when leaving the persian gulf make straight for the east coast seeing that the monsoon blows for six months in the year dead in that direction while for the other six months it blows back again and by the way of illustrating the probability i may add that to this day a very extensive trade is carried on between the persian gulf and lamu and other east african ports as far south as madagascar which is of course the ancient ebony isle of the arabian nights editor chapter ix realising that she was rapidly losing ground by exercising her advantage over alfred in the matter of quick retort zoie with her customary cunning veered round to a more conciliatory tone well she cooed suppose i did eat lunch with a man ah shrieked alfred as though he had at last run his victim to earth she retreated with her fingers crossed i only said suppose she reminded him quickly then she continued in a tone meant to draw from him his heart's most secret confidence didn't you ever eat lunch with any woman but me never answered alfred firmly there was an unmistakable expression of pleasure on zoie's small face but she forced back the smile that was trying to creep round her lips and sidled toward alfred with eyes properly downcast then i'm very sorry i did it she said solemnly and i'll never do it again so cried alfred with renewed indignation you admit it just to please you dear explained zoie sweetly as though she were doing him the greatest possible favour to please me gasped alfred do you suppose it pleases me to know that you are carrying on the moment my back is turned making a fool of me to my friends your friends cried zoie with a sneer this time it was her turn to be angry so it's your friends that are worrying you in her excitement she tossed alfred's now damaged hat into the chair just behind her he was far too overwrought to see it i haven't done you any harm she continued wildly it's only what you think your friends think you haven't done me any harm repeated alfred in her same tragic key oh no oh no you've only cheated me out of everything i expected to get out of life that's all zoie came to a full stop and waited for him to enumerate the various treasures that he had lost by marrying her he did so before we were married he continued you pretended to adore children you started your humbugging the first day i met you i refer to little willie peck a hysterical giggle very nearly betrayed her alfred continued i was fool enough to let you know that i admire women who like children from that day until the hour that i led you to the altar you'd fondle the ugliest little brats that we met in the street but the moment you got me alfred gasped zoie this was really going too far yes i repeat it shouted alfred pounding the table with his fist for emphasis the moment you got me you declared that all children were horrid little insects and that someone ought to sprinkle on them oh protested zoie shocked less by alfred's interpretation of her sentiments than by the vulgarity with which he expressed them on another occasion declared alfred now carried away by the recital of his long pent up wrongs you told me that all babies should be put in cages shipped west and kept in pens until they got to be of an interesting age interesting age he repeated with a sneer meaning old enough to take you out to luncheon i suppose i never said any such thing objected zoie well that was the idea insisted alfred i haven't your glib way of expressing myself you manage to express yourself very well retorted zoie when you have anything disagreeable to say as for babies she continued tentatively i think they are all very well in their place but they were never meant for an apartment i offered you a house in the country shouted alfred the country echoed zoie how could i live in the country with people being murdered in their beds every night read the papers always an excuse sighed alfred resignedly there always has been and there always would be if i'd stay to listen well for once he declared i'm glad that we have no children if we had i might feel some obligation to keep up this farce of a marriage as it is he continued you are free and i am free and with a courtly wave of his arm he dismissed zoie and the entire subject and again he started in pursuit of mary and his hat if it's your freedom you wish pouted zoie with an abused air you might have said so in the first place alfred stopped in sheer amazement at the cleverness with which the little minx turned his every statement against him it's not very manly of you she continued to abuse me just because you've found someone whom you like better that's not true protested alfred hotly and you know it's not true little did he suspect the trap into which she was leading him then you don't love anybody more than you do me she cried eagerly and she gazed up at him with adoring eyes i didn't say any such thing hedged alfred then you do she accused him i don't he declared in self defence with a cry of joy she sprang into his arms clasped her fingers tightly behind his neck and rained impulsive kisses upon his unsuspecting face for an instant alfred looked down at zoie undecided whether to strangle her or to return her embraces as usual his won the day for him and with a determined effort he lifted her high in the air so that she lost her tenacious hold of him and sat her down with a thud in the very same chair in which she had lately dropped his hat having acted with this admirable resolution he strode majestically toward the inner hall but before he could reach it zoie was again on her feet in a last vain effort to conciliate him turning alfred caught sight of his poor battered hat this was the final spur to action snatching it up with one hand and throwing his latchkey on the table with the other he made determinedly for the outer door how mr ralph nickleby provided for his niece and on the second morning after the departure of nicholas for yorkshire kate nickleby sat in a very faded chair raised upon a very dusty throne in miss la room giving that lady a sitting for the portrait upon which she was engaged and towards the full perfection of which miss la creevy had had the case brought upstairs in order that she might be the better able to infuse into the counterfeit countenance of miss nickleby a bright salmon which she had originally hit upon while executing the miniature of a young officer therein contained and which bright salmon was considered by miss la chief friends and patrons to be quite a novelty in art as indeed it was i think i have caught it now said miss la creevy the very shade this will be the sweetest portrait i have ever done certainly it will be your genius that makes it so then i am sure replied kate smiling no no i allow that my dear rejoined miss la creevy a very nice subject a very nice subject indeed though of course something depends upon the mode of treatment and not a little observed kate why my dear you are right there said miss la creevy in the main you are right there though i allow that it is of such very great importance in the present case ah the difficulties of art my dear are great they must be i have no doubt said kate humouring her little friend they are beyond anything you can form the faintest conception of replied miss la creevy what with bringing out eyes with all power and keeping down noses with all force and adding to heads and taking away teeth altogether you have no idea of the trouble one little miniature is the remuneration can scarcely repay you said kate why it does not and the truth answered miss la creevy and then people are so dissatisfied and unreasonable that nine times out of ten no pleasure in painting them sometimes they say oh how very serious you have made me look miss la creevy and at others la miss la creevy how very smirking when the very essence of a good portrait is that it must be either serious or smirking or no portrait at all indeed said kate laughing certainly my dear because the sitters are always either the one or the other replied miss la creevy look at the royal academy all those beautiful shiny portraits of gentlemen in black velvet waistcoats with their fists doubled up on round tables or marble slabs are serious you know and all the ladies who are playing with little parasols or little dogs or little children the same rule in art only varying the objects are smirking in fact said miss la creevy sinking her voice to a confidential whisper there are only two styles of portrait painting the serious and the smirk and we always use the serious for professional people except actors sometimes and the smirk for private ladies and gentlemen who care so much about looking clever kate seemed highly amused by this information and miss la creevy went on painting and talking with immovable complacency what a number of officers you seem to paint said kate availing herself of a pause in the discourse and glancing round the room number of what child inquired miss la creevy looking up from her work character portraits oh yes not real military men you know no bless your heart of course not only clerks and that who hire a uniform coat to be painted in and send it here in a carpet bag some artists said miss la creevy keep a red coat and charge extra for hire and carmine but i do that myself for i consider it legitimate drawing herself up as though she plumed herself greatly upon not resorting to these lures to catch sitters miss la creevy applied herself more intently to her task only raising her head occasionally to look with unspeakable satisfaction at some touch she had just put in and now and then giving miss nickleby to understand what particular feature she was at work upon at the moment not she expressly observed that you should make it up for painting my dear but because our custom sometimes to tell sitters what part we are upon in order that if any particular expression they want introduced they may throw it in at the time you know and when said miss la creevy after a long silence to wit an interval of full a minute and a half when do you expect to see your uncle again i scarcely know i had expected to have seen him before now replied kate soon i hope for this state of uncertainty is worse than anything i suppose he has money he inquired miss la creevy he is very rich i have heard rejoined kate i know that he is but i believe so ah you may depend upon it he is or he be so surly remarked miss la creevy who was an odd little mixture of shrewdness and simplicity when a a bear he is generally pretty independent it happened in this wise but sitting with my pen in my hand looking at those words again without descrying any hint in them of the words that should follow it comes into my mind that they have an abrupt appearance they may serve however if i let them remain to suggest how very difficult i find it to begin to explain my explanation an uncouth phrase and yet i do not see my way to a better second chapter it happened in this wise but looking at those words and comparing them with my former opening i find they are the words repeated this is the more surprising to me because i employ them in quite a new connection for indeed i declare that my intention was to discard the commencement i first had in my thoughts and to give the preference to another of an entirely different nature dating my explanation from an anterior period of my life i will make a third trial without erasing this second failure protesting that it is not my design to conceal any of my infirmities whether they be of head or heart third chapter not as yet directly aiming at how it came to pass i will come upon it by degrees the natural manner after all for god knows that is how it came upon me my parents were in a miserable condition of life and my infant home was a cellar in preston i recollect the sound of lancashire clogs on the street pavement above as being different in my young hearing from the sound of all other clogs and i recollect that when mother came down the i used tremblingly to speculate on her feet having a good or an look on her knees on her waist until finally her face came into view and settled the question from this it will be seen that i was timid and that the were steep and that the doorway was very low mother had the gripe and clutch of poverty upon her face upon her figure and not least of all upon her voice her sharp and words were squeezed out of her as by the compression of bony fingers on a leathern bag and she had a way of rolling her eyes about and about the cellar as she scolded that was gaunt and hungry father with his shoulders rounded would sit quiet on a stool looking at the empty grate until she would pluck the stool from under him and bid him go bring some money home then he would dismally ascend the steps and i holding my ragged shirt and trousers together with a hand my only braces would feint and dodge from pursuing grasp at my hair a worldly little devil was usual name for me whether i cried for that i was in the dark or for that it was cold or for that i was hungry or whether i squeezed myself into a warm corner when there was a fire or ate voraciously when there was food she would still say o you worldly little devil and the sting of it was that i quite well knew myself to be a worldly little devil worldly as to wanting to be housed and warmed worldly as to wanting to be fed worldly as to the greed with which i inwardly compared how much i got of those good things with how much father and mother got when rarely those good things were going sometimes they both went away seeking work and then i would be locked up in the cellar for a day or two at a time i was at my worldliest then left alone i yielded myself up to a worldly yearning for enough of anything except misery and for the death of father who was a at birmingham and on whose decease i had heard mother say she would come into a whole courtful of houses if she had her rights worldly little devil i would stand about musingly fitting my cold bare feet into cracked bricks and crevices of the damp walking over my body so to speak into the courtful of houses and selling them for meat and drink and clothes to wear at last a change came down into our cellar the universal change came down even as low as that so will it mount to any height on which a human creature can perch and brought other changes with it we had a heap of i know what foul litter in the darkest corner which we called the bed for three days mother lay upon it without getting up and then began at times to laugh if i had ever heard her laugh before it had been so seldom that the strange sound frightened me it frightened father too and we took it by turns to give her water then she began to move her head from side to side and sing after that she getting no better father fell and and then there was only i to give them both water and they both died fourth chapter when i was lifted out of the cellar by two men of whom one came peeping down alone first and ran away and brought the other i could hardly bear the light of the street i was sitting in the blinking at it and at a ring of people collected around me but not close to me when true to my character of worldly little devil i broke silence by saying i am hungry and thirsty iii at carnival time in the sixth year of life at the hermitage a merry company of rich people men and women from a neighbouring town made up a after a meal of and wine the company consisted of two lawyers a wealthy landowner an officer and four ladies one lady was the wife another the wife of the landowner the third his sister a young girl and the fourth a divorcee beautiful rich and eccentric who amazed and shocked the town by her escapades the weather was excellent and the road smooth as a floor they drove some seven miles out of town and then stopped and consulted as to whether they should turn back or drive farther but where does this road lead to asked makovkina the beautiful divorcee to tambov eight miles from here replied one of the lawyers who was having a flirtation with her and then where then on to l past the monastery where that father sergius lives yes kasatsky the handsome hermit yes mesdames et messieurs let us drive on and see kasatsky we can stop at tambov and have something to eat but we get home never mind we will stay at well there is a very good hostelry at the monastery i stayed there when i was defending makhin no i shall spend the night at impossible even your omnipotence could not accomplish that impossible will you bet all right if you spend the night with him the stake shall be whatever you like a discretion but on your side too yes of course let us drive on vodka was handed to the drivers and the party got out a box of pies wine and sweets for themselves the ladies wrapped up in their white dogskins the drivers disputed as to whose troyka should go ahead and the youngest seating himself sideways with a dashing air swung his long knout and shouted to the horses the tinkled and the squeaked over the snow the sledge swayed hardly at all the with his tightly bound tail under his decorated breechband galloped smoothly and briskly the smooth road seemed to run rapidly backwards while the driver dashingly shook the reins one of the lawyers and the officer sitting opposite talked nonsense to neighbour but makovkina herself sat motionless and in thought tightly wrapped in her fur always the same and always nasty the same red shiny faces smelling of wine and cigars the same talk the same thoughts and always about the same things and they are all satisfied and confident that it should be so and will go on living like that till they die but i it bores me i want something that would upset it all and turn it upside down suppose it happened to us as to those people at saratov was it who kept on driving and froze to death what would our people do how would they behave basely for certain each for himself and i too should act badly but i at any rate have beauty they all know it and how about that monk is it possible that he has become indifferent to it no that is the one thing they all care for like that cadet last autumn what a fool he was ivan nikolaevich she said aloud what are your commands how old is he who kasatsky over forty i should think and does he receive all visitors yes everybody but not always cover up my feet not like that how clumsy you are no more more like that but you need not squeeze them so they came to the forest where the cell was makovkina got out of the sledge and told them to drive on they tried to dissuade her but she grew irritable and ordered them to go on when the sledges had gone she went up the path in her white dogskin coat the lawyer got out and stopped to watch her it was father sixth year as a recluse and he was now his life in solitude was hard not on account of the fasts and the prayers they were no hardship to him but on account of an inner conflict he had not at all anticipated the sources of that conflict were two doubts and the lust of the flesh and these two enemies always appeared together it seemed to him that they were two foes but in reality they were one and the same as soon as doubt was gone so was the lustful desire but thinking them to be two different fiends he fought them separately o my god my god thought he why dost thou not grant me faith there is lust of course even the saints had to fight that saint anthony and others but they had faith while i have moments hours and days when it is absent why does the whole world with all its delights exist if it is sinful and must be renounced why hast thou created this temptation temptation is it not rather a temptation that i wish to abandon all the joys of earth and prepare something for myself there where perhaps there is nothing and he became horrified and filled with disgust at himself vile creature and it is you who wish to become a saint he upbraided himself and he began to pray but as soon as he started to pray he saw himself vividly as he had been at the monastery in a majestic post in biretta and mantle and he shook his head no that is not right it is deception i may deceive others but not myself or god i am not a majestic man but a pitiable and ridiculous one and he threw back the folds of his cassock and smiled as he looked at his thin legs in their underclothing chapter xviii that was a thought almost continuously in his mind even when he was hardest at work and as the days went on and he could not free himself he became querulous about it i guess i'm the biggest dang fool alive he told his wife as they sat together one evening i got plenty else to bother me without worrying my head off about what he thinks i can't help what he thinks it's too late for that so why should i keep pestering myself about it it'll wear off virgil mrs adams said reassuringly she was gentle and sympathetic with him and for the first time in many years he would come to sit with her and talk when he had finished his day's work he had told her evading her eye oh i don't blame you you didn't get after me to do this on your own account you couldn't help it yes but it don't wear off he complained this afternoon i was showing the men how i wanted my vats to go and i caught my fool self standing there saying to my fool self it's funny i don't hear how he feels about it from somebody i was saying it aloud almost and it is funny i don't hear anything well you see what it means don't you virgil it only means he hasn't said anything to anybody about it don't you think you're getting kind of morbid over it maybe maybe he muttered why yes she said briskly you don't realize what a little bit of a thing all this is to him it's been a long long while since the last time you even mentioned glue to him and he's probably forgotten everything about it you're off your base it isn't like him to forget things adams returned peevishly he may seem to forget em but he don't but he's not thinking about this or you'd have heard from him before now her husband shook his head ah that's just it he said why haven't i heard from him it's all your morbidness virgil look at walter if mr lamb held this up against you would he still let walter stay there wouldn't he have discharged walter if he felt angry with you that dang boy adams said if he wanted to come with me now i wouldn't hardly let him what do you suppose makes him so but hasn't he a right to choose for himself she asked i suppose he feels he ought to stick to what he thinks is sure pay as soon as he sees that you're going to succeed with the he'll want to be with you quick enough well he better get a little sense in his head adams returned crossly he wanted me to pay him a bonus in advance when anybody with a grain of common sense knows i need every penny i can lay my hands on never mind she said he'll come around later and be glad of the chance he'll have to beg for it then i won't ask him again oh walter will come out all right you needn't worry and don't you see that mr lamb's not discharging him means there's no hard feeling against you virgil i can't make it out at all he said frowning the only thing i can think it means is that j a lamb is so and of course he is one of the men alive i suppose that's the reason he hasn't fired walter he may know adams concluded morosely he may know that's just another thing to make me feel all the meaner keeping my boy there on a salary after i've done him an injury now now she said trying to comfort him you couldn't do anybody an injury to save your life and everybody knows it well anybody ought to know i wouldn't want to do an injury but this world isn't built so't we can do just what we want he paused reflecting of course there may be one explanation of why walter's still there j a maybe hasn't noticed that he is there there's so many i expect he hardly knows him by sight well just do quit thinking about it she urged him it only bothers you without doing any good don't you know that don't i though he laughed feebly i know it better'n anybody how funny that is when you know thinking about a thing only pesters you without helping anything at all and yet you keep right on pestering yourself with it but why she said what's the use when you know you haven't done anything wrong virgil you said yourself you were going to improve the process so much it would be different from the old one and you'd really have a right to it adams had persuaded himself of this when he yielded he had found it necessary to persuade himself of it though there was a part of him of course that remained unpersuaded and this discomfiting part of him was what made his present trouble yes i know he said that's true but i can't quite seem to get away from the fact that the principle of the process is a good deal the same well it's more'n that it's just about the same as the one he hired campbell and me to work out for him truth is nobody could tell the difference and i don't know as there is any difference except in these improvements i'm making of course the improvements do give me pretty near a perfect right to it as a person might say and that's one of the things i thought of putting in my letter to him but i was afraid he'd just think i was trying to make up excuses so i left it out i kind of worried all the time i was writing that letter because if he thought i was just making up excuses why it might set him just so much more against me chapter dombey and son dombey sat in the corner of the darkened room in the great by the bedside and son lay tucked up warm in a little basket bedstead carefully disposed on a low settee immediately in front of the fire and close to it as if his constitution were analogous to that of a muffin and it was essential to toast him brown while he was very new dombey was about years of age son about minutes dombey was rather bald rather red and though a handsome man too stern and pompous in appearance to be prepossessing son was very bald and very red and though of course an undeniably fine infant somewhat crushed and spotty in his general effect as yet on the brow of dombey time and his brother care had set some marks as on a tree that was to come down in good time remorseless twins they are for striding through their human forests notching as they go while the countenance of son was crossed with a thousand little creases which the same deceitful time would take delight in smoothing out and wearing away with the flat part of his scythe as a preparation of the surface for his deeper operations dombey exulting in the event jingled and jingled the heavy gold that depended from below his trim blue coat whereof the buttons sparkled phosphorescently in the feeble rays of the distant fire son with his little fists curled up and clenched seemed in his feeble way to be squaring at existence for having come upon him so unexpectedly the house will once again mrs dombey said mr dombey be not only in name but in fact dombey and son and he added in a tone of luxurious satisfaction with his eyes as if he were reading the name in a device of flowers and inhaling their fragrance at the same time and son the words had such a softening influence that he appended a term of endearment to mrs name though not without some hesitation as being a man but little used to that form of address and said mrs dombey my my dear a transient flush of faint surprise overspread the sick face as she raised her eyes towards him he will be christened paul my mrs dombey of course she feebly echoed of course or rather expressed it by the motion of her lips and closed her eyes again his name mrs dombey and his i wish his grandfather were alive this day there is some inconvenience in the necessity of writing junior said mr dombey making a fictitious autograph on his knee but it is merely of a private and personal complexion it enter into the correspondence of the house its signature remains the same and again he said dombey and son in exactly the same tone as before those three words conveyed the one idea of mr life the earth was made for dombey and son to trade in and the sun and moon were made to give them light rivers and seas were formed to float their ships rainbows gave them promise of fair weather winds blew for or against their enterprises stars and planets circled in their orbits to preserve inviolate a system of which they were the centre common abbreviations took new meanings in his eyes and had sole reference to them a d had no concern with anno domini but stood for anno dombei and son he had risen as his father had before him in the course of life and death from son to dombey and for nearly twenty years had been the sole representative of the firm of those years he had been married ten married as some said to a lady with no heart to give him whose happiness was in the past and who was content to bind her broken spirit to the dutiful and meek endurance of the present such idle talk was little likely to reach the ears of mr dombey whom it nearly concerned and probably no one in the world would have received it with such utter incredulity as he if it had reached him dombey and son had often dealt in hides but never in hearts they left that fancy ware to boys and girls and and books mr dombey would have reasoned that a matrimonial alliance with himself must in the nature of things be gratifying and honourable to any woman of common sense that the hope of giving birth to a new partner in such a house could not fail to awaken a glorious and stirring ambition in the breast of the least ambitious of her sex that mrs dombey had entered on that social contract of matrimony almost necessarily part of a genteel and wealthy station even without reference to the perpetuation of family firms with her eyes fully open to these advantages that mrs dombey had had daily practical knowledge of his position in society that mrs dombey had always sat at the head of his table and done the honours of his house in a remarkably and becoming manner that mrs dombey must have been happy that she help it bunches of knuckles arrangements quite extensive had been made for the celebration of christmas on the yacht samoset not having been in any civilized port for months the stock of provisions boasted few delicacies yet minnie duncan had managed to devise real feasts for cabin and forecastle listen boyd she told her husband here are the menus for the cabin raw bonita native style turtle soup omelette a la samoset what the dickens boyd duncan interrupted well if you must know i found a tin of mushrooms and a package of which had fallen down behind the locker and there are other things as well that will go into it but don't interrupt boiled yam fried taro alligator pear salad there you've got me all mixed then i found a last delectable of dried squid there will be baked beans mexican if i can hammer it into toyama's head also baked papaia with marquesan honey and lastly a wonderful pie the secret of which toyama refuses to divulge i wonder if it is possible to concoct a punch or a cocktail out of trade rum duncan muttered gloomily oh i forgot come with me his wife caught his hand and led him through the small connecting door to her tiny stateroom still holding his hand she fished in the depths of a and brought forth a pint bottle of champagne the dinner is complete he cried wait she fished again and was rewarded with a whisky flask she held it to the light of a and the liquor showed a quarter of the distance from the bottom i've been saving it for weeks she explained and there's enough for you and captain dettmar two mighty small drinks duncan complained there would have been more but i gave a drink to lorenzo when he was sick duncan growled might have given him rum facetiously the nasty stuff for a sick man don't be greedy boyd and i'm glad there isn't any more for captain dettmar's sake drinking always makes him irritable and now for the men's dinner soda crackers sweet cakes candy substantial i must say do hush rice and curry yam taro bonita of course a big cake toyama is making young pig oh i say he protested it is all right boyd we'll be in in three days besides it's my pig that old chief distinctly presented it to me you saw him yourself and then two tins of bullamacow that's their dinner and now about the presents shall we wait until tomorrow or give them this evening christmas eve by all means was the man's judgment we'll call all hands at eight bells i'll give them a tot of rum all around and then you give the presents come on up on deck it's stifling down here i hope lorenzo has better luck with the dynamo without the fans there won't be much sleeping if we're driven below they passed through the small climbed a steep companion ladder and emerged on deck the sun was setting and the promise was for a clear tropic night the samoset with fore and winged out on either side was slipping a lazy through the smooth sea through the skylight came a sound of hammering they strolled aft to where captain dettmar one foot on the rail was oiling the gear of the patent log at the wheel stood a tall south sea islander clad in white undershirt and scarlet boyd duncan was an original at least that was the belief of his friends of comfortable fortune with no need to do anything but take his comfort he elected to travel about the world in outlandish and most uncomfortable ways incidentally he had ideas about disagreed profoundly with darwin on that subject had voiced his opinion in several monographs and one book and was now back at his hobby cruising the south seas in a tiny yacht and studying his wife minnie duncan was also declared an original inasmuch as she joyfully shared his vagabond wanderings among other things in the six exciting years of their marriage she had climbed chimborazo with him made a winter journey with dogs and sleds in alaska ridden a horse from canada to mexico cruised the mediterranean in a yawl and canoed from germany to the black sea across the heart of europe they were a royal pair of wanderlusters he big and she a small brunette and happy woman whose one hundred and fifteen pounds were all grit and endurance and withal pleasing to look upon the samoset had been a trading schooner when duncan bought her in san francisco and made alterations her interior was wholly rebuilt so that the hold became and staterooms while abaft amidships were installed engines a dynamo an ice machine storage batteries and far in the stern gasoline tanks necessarily she carried a small crew boyd minnie and captain dettmar were the only whites on board though lorenzo the small and greasy engineer laid a part claim to white being a portuguese a japanese served as cook and a chinese as cabin boy four white sailors had constituted the original crew for'ard but one by one they had yielded to the charms of south sea isles and been replaced by islanders thus one of the dusky sailors hailed from easter island a second from the carolines a third from the paumotus while the fourth was a gigantic samoan at sea boyd duncan himself a navigator stood a mate's watch with captain dettmar and both of them took a wheel or lookout occasionally on a pinch minnie herself could take a wheel and it was on pinches that she proved herself more dependable at steering than did the native sailors inside the sphere go on said cavor as i sat across the edge of the manhole and looked down into the black interior of the sphere we two were alone it was evening the sun had set and the stillness of the twilight was upon everything i drew my other leg inside and slid down the smooth glass to the bottom of the sphere then turned to take the cans of food and other impedimenta from cavor the interior was warm the thermometer stood at eighty and as we should lose little or none of this by radiation we were dressed in shoes and thin flannels we had however a bundle of thick woollen clothing and several thick blankets to guard against mischance by cavor's direction i placed the packages the cylinders of oxygen and so forth loosely about my feet and soon we had everything in he walked about the roofless shed for a time seeking anything we had overlooked and then crawled in after me i noted something in his hand what have you got there i asked haven't you brought anything to read good lord no i forgot to tell you there are uncertainties the voyage may last we may be weeks but we shall be floating in this sphere with absolutely no occupation i wish i'd known he peered out of the manhole look he said there's something there is there time we shall be an hour i looked out it was an old number of that one of the men must have brought farther away in the corner i saw a torn lloyd's news i scrambled back into the sphere with these things what have you got i said i took the book from his hand and read the works of william shakespeare he coloured slightly my education has been so purely scientific he said apologetically never read him never he knew a little you know in an irregular sort of way precisely what i am told said cavor i assisted him to screw in the glass cover of the manhole and then he pressed a stud to close the corresponding blind in the outer case the little oblong of twilight vanished we were in darkness for a time neither of us spoke although our case would not be impervious to sound everything was very still i perceived there was nothing to grip when the shock of our start should come and i realised that i should be uncomfortable for want of a chair why have we no chairs i asked i've settled all that said cavor we won't need them why not you will see he said in the tone of a man who refuses to talk i became silent suddenly it had come to me clear and vivid that i was a fool to be inside that sphere even now i asked myself is to too late to withdraw the world outside the sphere i knew would be cold and inhospitable enough for me for weeks i had been living on subsidies from cavor but after all would it be as cold as the infinite zero as inhospitable as empty space if it had not been for the appearance of cowardice i believe that even then i should have made him let me out but i hesitated on that score and hesitated and grew fretful and angry and the time passed there came a little jerk a noise like champagne being uncorked in another room and a faint whistling sound for just one instant i had a sense of enormous tension a transient conviction that my feet were pressing downward with a force of countless tons it lasted for an infinitesimal time but it stirred me to action cavor i said into the darkness my nerve's in rags i don't think i stopped he made no answer confound it i cried i'm a fool what business have i here i'm not coming cavor the thing's too risky i'm getting out you can't he said can't we'll soon see about that he made no answer for ten seconds it's too late for us to quarrel now bedford he said that little jerk was the start already we are flying as swiftly as a bullet up into the gulf of space i i said and then it didn't seem to matter what happened for a time i was as it were stunned i had nothing to say it was just as if i had never heard of this idea of leaving the world before then i perceived an unaccountable change in my bodily sensations it was a feeling of lightness of unreality coupled with that was a queer sensation in the head an apoplectic effect almost and a thumping of blood vessels at the ears neither of these feelings diminished as time went on but at last i got so used to them that i experienced no inconvenience i heard a click and a little glow lamp came into being i saw cavor's face as white as i felt my own to be we regarded one another in silence the transparent blackness of the glass behind him made him seem as though he floated in a void well we're committed i said at last yes he said we're committed don't move he exclaimed at some suggestion of a gesture let your muscles keep quite lax as if you were in bed we are in a little universe of our own look at those things marie was busy turning over the contents of a drawer as she answered well of course by and by eva you will have other things to think of besides reading the bible round to servants not but that is very proper done it myself when i had health but when you come to be dressing and going into company you have time see here she added these jewels going to give you when you come out i wore them to my first ball i can tell you eva i made a sensation eva took the and lifted from it a diamond necklace her large thoughtful eyes rested on them but it was plain her thoughts were elsewhere how sober you look child said marie are these worth a great deal of money mamma to be sure they are father sent to france for them they are worth a small fortune i wish i had them said eva to do what i pleased with what would you do with them sell them and buy a place in the free states and take all our people there and hire teachers to teach them to read and write eva was cut short by her laughing set up a you teach them to play on the piano and paint on velvet teach them to read their own bible and write their own letters and read letters that are written to them said eva steadily i know mamma it does come very hard on them that they do these things tom feels it mammy does a great many of them do i think wrong come come eva you are only a child you know anything about these things said marie besides your talking makes my head ache marie always had a headache on hand for any conversation that did not exactly suit her eva stole away but after that she assiduously gave mammy reading lessons chapter xxiii henrique about this time st brother alfred with his eldest son a boy of twelve spent a day or two with the family at the lake no sight could be more singular and beautiful than that of these twin brothers nature instead of instituting resemblances between them had made them opposites on every point yet a mysterious tie seemed to unite them in a closer friendship than ordinary they used to saunter arm in arm up and down the alleys and walks of the garden augustine with his blue eyes and golden hair his ethereally flexible form and vivacious features and alfred with haughty roman profile limbs and decided bearing they were always abusing each opinions and practices and yet never a whit the less absorbed in each society in fact the very contrariety seemed to unite them like the attraction between opposite poles of the magnet henrique the eldest son of alfred was a noble princely boy full of vivacity and spirit and from the first moment of introduction seemed to be perfectly fascinated by the spirituelle graces of his cousin evangeline eva had a little pet pony of a snowy whiteness it was easy as a cradle and as gentle as its little mistress and this pony was now brought up to the back verandah by tom while a little mulatto boy of about thirteen led along a small black arabian which had just been imported at a great expense for henrique henrique had a pride in his new possession and as he advanced and took the reins out of the hands of his little groom he looked carefully over him and his brow darkened this dodo you little lazy dog you rubbed my horse down this morning yes said dodo submissively he got that dust on his own self you rascal shut your mouth said henrique violently raising his how dare you speak the boy was a handsome mulatto of just size and his curling hair hung round a high bold forehead he had white blood in his veins as could be seen by the quick flush in his cheek and the sparkle of his eye as he eagerly tried to speak henrique he began henrique struck him across the face with his and seizing one of his arms forced him on to his knees and beat him till he was out of breath there you impudent dog now will you learn not to answer back when i speak to you take the horse back and clean him properly teach you your place young said tom i specs what he was gwine to say was that the horse would roll when he was bringing him up from the stable so full of spirits the way he got that dirt on him i looked to his cleaning you hold your tongue till asked to speak said henrique turning on his heel and walking up the steps to speak to eva who stood in her dear cousin sorry this stupid fellow has kept you waiting he said sit down here on this seat till they come the matter cousin you look sober how could you be so cruel and wicked to poor dodo asked eva xix the feast's end the feast was a noble feast as has already been said there was an elegant ingenuity displayed in the form of pies which delighted my heart once acknowledge that an american pie is far to be preferred to its humble ancestor the english tart and it is joyful to be reassured at a bowden reunion that invention has not yet failed beside a delightful variety of material the decorations went beyond all my former experience dates and names were wrought in lines of pastry and frosting on the tops there was even more elaborate reading matter on an excellent pie which we began to share and eat precept upon precept mrs todd helped me generously to the whole word bowden and consumed reunion herself save an undecipherable fragment but the most renowned essay in cookery on the tables was a model of the old bowden house made of durable gingerbread with all the windows and doors in the right places and sprigs of genuine lilac set at the front it must have been baked in sections in one of the last of the great brick ovens and fastened together on the morning of the day there was a general sigh when this fell into ruin at the feast's end and it was shared by a great part of the assembly not without seriousness and as if it were a pledge and token of loyalty i met the maker of the gingerbread house which had called up lively remembrances of a childish story she had the gleaming eye of an enthusiast and a look of high ideals i could just as well have made it all of frosted cake she said but twouldn't have been the right shade the old house as you observe was never painted and i concluded that plain gingerbread would represent it best it wasn't all i expected it would be she said sadly as many an artist had said before her of his work there were speeches by the ministers and there proved to be a historian among the bowdens who gave some fine anecdotes of the family history and then appeared a poetess whom mrs todd regarded with wistful compassion and indulgence and when the long faded garland of verses came to an appealing end she turned to me with words of praise sounded pretty said the generous listener yes i thought she did very well we went to school together an mary anna had a very hard time trouble was her mother thought she'd given birth to a genius an mary anna's come to believe it herself there i don't know what we should have done without her there ain't nobody else that can write poetry between here and way up towards rockland it adds a great deal at such a time when she speaks o those that are gone she feels it all and so does everybody else but she harps too much i'd laid half of that away for next time if i was mary anna there comes mother to speak to her an old mr gilbreath's sister now she'll be heartened right up mother'll say just the right thing the were as affecting as the meetings of these old friends had been there were enough young persons at the reunion but it is the old who really value such opportunities as for the young it is the habit of every day to meet their comrades the time of separation has not come to see the joy with which these elder kinsfolk and acquaintances had looked in one another's faces and the lingering touch of their friendly hands to see these affectionate meetings and then the reluctant partings gave one a new idea of the isolation in which it was possible to live in that after all thinly settled region they did not expect to see one another again very soon the steady hard work on the farms the difficulty of getting from place to place especially in winter when boats were laid up gave double value to any occasion which could bring a large number of families together even funerals in this country of the pointed firs were not without their social advantages and satisfactions i heard the words next summer repeated many times though summer was still ours and all the leaves were green the boats began to put out from shore and the wagons to drive away mrs blackett took me into the old house when we came back from the grove it was her father's birthplace and early home and she had spent much of her own childhood there with her grandmother she spoke of those days as if they had but lately passed in fact i could imagine that the house looked almost exactly the same to her i could see the brown rafters of the unfinished roof as i looked up the steep staircase though the best room was as handsome with its good wainscoting and touch of ornament on the cornice as any old room of its day in a town some of the guests who came from a distance were still sitting in the best room when we went in to take leave of the master and mistress of the house we all said eagerly what a pleasant day it had been and how swiftly the time had passed perhaps it is the great national anniversaries which our country has lately kept and the soldiers meetings that take place everywhere which have made reunions of every sort the fashion this one at least had been very interesting i fancied that old feuds had been overlooked and the old saying that blood is thicker than water had again proved itself true though from the variety of names one argued a certain adulteration of the bowden traits and belongings clannishness is an instinct of the heart it is more than a birthright or a custom and lesser rights were forgotten in the claim to a common inheritance pinocchio runs the danger of being fried in a pan like a fish during that wild chase pinocchio lived through a terrible moment when he almost gave himself up as lost this was when alidoro that was the name in a frenzy of running came so near that he was on the very point of reaching him the marionette heard close behind him the labored breathing of the beast who was fast on his trail and now and again even felt his hot breath blow over him luckily by this time he was very near the shore and the sea was in sight in fact only a few short steps away as soon as he set foot on the beach pinocchio gave a leap and fell into the water alidoro tried to stop but as he was running very fast he and he too landed far out in the sea strange though it may seem the dog could not swim he beat the water with his paws to hold himself up but the harder he tried the deeper he sank as he stuck his head out once more the poor eyes were bulging and he barked out wildly i drown i drown drown answered pinocchio from afar happy at his escape help pinocchio dear little pinocchio save me from death at those cries of suffering the marionette who after all had a very kind heart was moved to compassion he turned toward the poor animal and said to him but if i help you will you promise not to bother me again by running after me i promise i promise only hurry for if you wait another second be dead and gone pinocchio hesitated still another minute then remembering how his father had often told him that a kind deed is never lost he swam to alidoro and catching hold of his tail dragged him to the shore the poor dog was so weak he could not stand he had swallowed so much salt water that he was swollen like a balloon however pinocchio not wishing to trust him too much threw himself once again into the sea as he swam away he called out alidoro good luck and remember me to the family little pinocchio answered the dog a thousand thanks for having saved me from death you did me a good turn and in this world what is given is always returned if the chance comes i shall be there pinocchio went on swimming close to shore at last he thought he had reached a safe place glancing up and down the beach he saw the opening of a cave out of which rose a spiral of smoke in that cave he said to himself there must be a fire so much the better dry my clothes and warm myself and then well his mind made up pinocchio swam to the rocks but as he started to climb he felt something under him lifting him up higher and higher he tried to escape but he was too late to his great surprise he found himself in a huge net amid a crowd of fish of all kinds and sizes who were fighting and struggling desperately to free themselves at the same time he saw a fisherman come out of the cave a fisherman so ugly that pinocchio thought he was a sea monster in place of hair his head was covered by a thick bush of green grass green was the skin of his body green were his eyes green was the long long beard that reached down to his feet he looked like a giant lizard with legs and arms when the fisherman pulled the net out of the sea he cried out joyfully blessed providence once more have a fine meal of fish thank heaven not a fish said pinocchio to himself trying with these words to find a little courage the fisherman took the net and the fish to the cave a dark gloomy smoky place in the middle of it a pan full of oil sizzled over a smoky fire sending out a repelling odor of tallow that took away breath now see what kind of fish we have caught today said the green fisherman he put a hand as big as a spade into the net and pulled out a handful of mullets fine mullets these he said after looking at them and smelling them with pleasure after that he threw them into a large empty tub many times he repeated this performance as he pulled each fish out of the net his mouth watered with the thought of the good dinner coming and he said fine fish these bass very tasty these whitefish delicious flounders these what splendid crabs and these dear little anchovies with their heads still on as you can well imagine the bass the flounders the whitefish and even the little anchovies all went together into the tub to keep the mullets company the last to come out of the net was pinocchio as soon as the fisherman pulled him out his green eyes opened wide with surprise and he cried out in fear what kind of fish is this i remember ever eating anything like it first period the public official the motives which inspired the actions of the devout have long been said kai lung the upon a certain occasion at and as a consequence his illustrious memory has suffered somewhat even as the insignificant may bring the precious and many coloured jewel to the surface so has it been permitted to this obscure and superficially educated one to discover the truth of the entire matter among the and frequently really illegible documents preserved at the hall of public reference at peking without fear of contradiction therefore he now sets forth the credible version was one who throughout his life had been compelled by the opposing force of circumstances to be content with what was offered rather than attain to that which he desired having been allowed to wander over the edge of an exceedingly steep crag while still a child by the aged and untrustworthy person who had the care of him and yet suffering little hurt he was carried back to the city in triumph by the one in question who to cover her neglect declared amid many chants of exultation that as he slept a majestic winged form had snatched him from her arms and traced magical figures with his body on the ground in token of the distinguished sacred existence for which he was undoubtedly set apart in such a manner he became famed at a very early age for an unassuming mildness of character and an almost inspired piety of life so that on every side frequent opportunity was given him for the display of these amiable qualities should it chance that an insufficient quantity of had been prepared for the family repast the undesirable but necessary portion of cold dried rat would inevitably be allotted to the uncomplaining quen doubtless accompanied by the engaging but unnecessary remark that he alone had a intellect which was fixed upon more sublime images than even the best constructed should the number of not be sufficient to bear to the exhibition of kites all who were desirous of becoming entertained in such a fashion inevitably would quen be the one left behind in order that he might have adequate leisure for dignified and internal reflexion in this manner it came about that when a very wealthy but unnaturally avaricious and person who was connected with father in matters of commerce expressed his fixed determination that the most deserving and enlightened of his sons should enter into a marriage agreement with his daughter there was no manner of hesitation among those concerned who admitted without any questioning between themselves that quen was undeniably the one referred to though naturally not possessing an insignificant intellect a continuous habit together with a most irreproachable sense of filial duty subdued within internal organs whatever reluctance he might have otherwise displayed in the matter so that as courteously as was necessary he presented to the undoubtedly very ordinary and maiden in question the gifts of irretrievable intention and honourably carried out his spoken and written words towards her for a period of years the circumstances of the various persons did not in any degree change quen in the meantime becoming more and with each after the manner of the sublime who studied to maintain an unmoved endurance in all varieties of events by placing his body to a greater extent each day in a vessel of boiling liquid nevertheless the good and charitable deities to whom quen unceasingly sacrificed were not altogether unmindful of his virtues for a son was born and an evil disease which arose from a most undignified display of uncontrollable emotion on her part ended in his wife being deposited with becoming ceremony in the family temple upon a certain evening when quen sat in his inner chamber deliberating upon the really beneficent yet somewhat inexplicable arrangement of the ones to whom he was very amiably disposed in consequence of the unwonted tranquillity which he now enjoyed yet who it appeared to him could have set out the entire matter in a much more satisfactory way from the beginning he was made aware by the unexpected beating of many gongs and by other signs of refined and deferential welcome that a person of exalted rank was approaching his residence while he was still hesitating in his uncertainty regarding the most courteous and delicate form of with which to honour so important a visitor whether to rush forth and allow the to pass over his prostrate form to make a pretence of being a slave and in that guise doing menial service or to conceal himself beneath a massive and overhanging table until his guest should have availed himself of the opportunity to examine at his leisure whatever the room contained the person in question stood before him in every detail of dress and appointment he had the undoubted appearance of being one to whom no door might be safely closed alas exclaimed quen how inferior and is the mind of a person of my feeble intellectual attainments even at this moment when the near approach of one who obviously commands every engaging accomplishment might reasonably be expected to call up within it an adequate amount of commonplace resource its possessor finds himself entirely incapable of conducting himself with the fitting outward marks of his great internal respect this residence is certainly unprepossessing in the extreme yet it contains many objects of some value and of great rarity illiterate as this person is he would not be so presumptuous as to offer any for your acceptance but if you will confer upon him the favour of selecting that which appears to be the most priceless and unreplaceable he will immediately and with every manifestation of extreme delight break it irredeemably in your honour to prove the unaffected depth of his gratified emotions chapter iii a conversation with mr merton on society mr and mrs james of sutton come up a miserable evening at the tank theatre experiments with enamel paint i make another good joke but gowing and cummings are unnecessarily offended i paint the bath red with unexpected result april cummings called bringing with him his friend merton who is in the wine trade gowing also called mr merton made himself at home at once and carrie and i were both struck with him immediately and thoroughly approved of his sentiments he leaned back in his chair and said you must take me as i am and i replied yes and you must take us as we are homely people we are not swells he answered no i can see that and gowing roared with laughter but merton in a most gentlemanly manner said to gowing i think you quite understand me i intended to convey that our charming host and hostess were superior to the follies of fashion and preferred leading a simple and wholesome life to gadding about to afternoons and living above their incomes i was immensely pleased with these sensible remarks of and concluded that subject by saying no candidly mr merton we go into society because we do not care for it and what with the expense of cabs here and cabs there and white gloves and white ties etc it seem worth the money merton said in reference to friends my motto is few and true and by the way i also apply that to wine little and good gowing said yes and sometimes cheap and tasty eh old man merton still continuing said he should treat me as a friend and put me down for a dozen of his lockanbar whisky and as i was an old friend of gowing i should have it for which was considerably under what he paid for it he booked his own order and further said that at any time i wanted any passes for the theatre i was to let him know as his name stood good for any theatre in london april carrie reminded me that as her old school friend annie fullers now mrs james and her husband had come up from sutton for a few days it would look kind to take them to the theatre and would i drop a line to mr merton asking him for passes for four either for the italian opera haymarket savoy or lyceum i wrote merton to that effect april got a reply from merton saying he was very busy and just at present manage passes for the italian opera haymarket savoy or lyceum but the best thing going on in london was the brown bushes at the tank theatre islington and enclosed seats for four also bill for whisky april mr and mrs james miss fullers that was came to meat tea and we left directly after for the tank theatre we got a bus that took us to cross and then changed into one that took us to the angel mr james each time insisted on paying for all saying that i had paid for the tickets and that was quite enough we arrived at theatre where curiously enough all our except an old woman with a basket seemed to be going in i walked ahead and presented the tickets the man looked at them and called out mr willowly do you know anything about these holding up my tickets the gentleman called to came up and examined my tickets and said who gave you these i said rather indignantly mr merton of course he said merton he i answered rather sharply you ought to know his good at any theatre in london he replied oh is it well it no good here these tickets which are not dated were issued under mr management which has since changed hands while i was having some very unpleasant words with the man james who had gone upstairs with the ladies called out come on i went up after them and a very civil attendant said this way please box h i said to james why how on earth did you manage it and to my horror he replied why paid for it of course this was humiliating enough and i could scarcely follow the play but i was doomed to still further humiliation i was leaning out of the box when my tie a little black bow which fastened on to the stud by means of a new patent fell into the pit below a clumsy man not noticing it had his foot on it for ever so long before he discovered it he then picked it up and eventually flung it under the next seat in disgust what with the box incident and the tie i felt quite miserable mr james of sutton was very good he said worry no one will notice it with your beard that is the only advantage of growing one that i can see there was no occasion for that remark for carrie is very proud of my beard to hide the absence of the tie i had to keep my chin down the rest of the evening which caused a pain at the back of my neck the story of weng cho or the one devoid of name there was in the orchards of a blue sky above and in the air much gladness but in wu yamen gloom hung like the herald of a thunderstorm at one end of a table in the ceremonial hall sat wu chi heaviness upon his brow deceit in his eyes and a sour enmity about the lines of his mouth at the other end stood his son weng and between them as it were his whole life lay wu chi was an official of some consequence and had two wives as became him his union with the first had failed in its essential purpose therefore he had taken another to carry on the direct line which alone could bring him contentment in this world and a reputable existence in the next this degree of happiness was supplied by mother yet she must ever remain but a secondary wife with no rights and a very insecure position in the heart of the chief wife smouldered a most bitter hatred but the hour of her ascendancy came for after many years she also bore her lord a son thenceforward she was strong in her authority but mother remained for she was very beautiful and despite all the arts of the other woman wu chi could not be prevailed upon to dismiss her the easy solution of this difficulty was that she soon died the white powder death was the shrewd comment of the inner chambers of wu chi put on no mourning custom did not require it and now that the woman had passed beyond he saw no necessity to honour her memory at the expense of his own domestic peace his wife donned her gayest robes and made a feast weng alone stood apart and in funereal sackcloth moved through the house like an accusing ghost each day his father met him with a frown the woman whom alone he must regard as his mother with a mocking smile but he passed them without any word of dutiful and submissive greeting the period of all seemly mourning ended it touched that allotted to a legal parent still weng cast himself down and made no pretence to hide his grief his frown became a scowl his smile framed a biting word a wise and venerable friend who loved the youth took him aside one day and with many sympathetic words counselled restraint for he said your conduct though affectionate towards the dead may be urged by the as disrespectful towards the living if you have a deeper end in view strive towards it by a less open path you are subtle and esteemed in wisdom replied weng but neither of those virtues can restore a broken jar the wayside fountain must one day dry up at its source but until then not even a mountain placed upon its mouth can pen back its secret stores so is it with unfeigned grief the analogy may be exact replied the aged friend shaking his head but it is no less truly said the wise tortoise keeps his pain inside rest assured on the disinterested advice of one who has no great experience of mountains and hidden springs but a knowledge of wu chi and of his amiable wife that if you mourn too much you will have reason to mourn more his words were pointed to a sharp edge at that moment wu chi was being confronted by his wife who stood before him in his inner chamber who am i she exclaimed vehemently that my authority should be denied before my very eyes am i indeed che of the house of meng whose ancestors wore the yellow scabbard or am i some nameless one or does my lord sleep or has he fallen blind upon the side by which weng approaches his heart is bad and his instincts perverted replied wu chi dully he ignores the rites custom and the example and sets at defiance all the principles of domestic government do not fear that i shall not shortly call him to account with a very heavy call do so my lord said his wife darkly or many valiant champions of the house of meng may press forward to make a cast of that same account to those of our ancient line it would not seem a trivial thing that their daughter should share her rights with a purchased slave peace cockatrice the woman was well enough exclaimed wu chi with slow resentment but the matter of this obstinacy touches the dignity of my own authority and before has passed weng shall bring up his footsteps suddenly before a solid wall accordingly when weng returned at his usual hour he found his father awaiting him with curbed impatience that wu chi should summon him into his presence in the great hall was of itself an omen that the matter was one of moment but the profusion of lights before the ancestral tablets and the various symbols arranged upon the table showed that the occasion was to be regarded as one involving irrevocable issues weng cho said his father dispassionately from his seat at the head of the table draw near and first pledge the ancient ones whose spirits hover above their tablets in a vessel of wine william gregg clerk and spy william gregg died was a scottish spy who had been a clerk to the secretary of state robert harley he was executed for treason after it was discovered that he had been selling state secrets to the french the affair gravely damaged harley politically as he was rightly criticised for facilitating gregg's treason through his lax security arrangements although it is generally accepted that he had no knowledge of the treason itself life james vernon secretary of state had known gregg's father also named william gregg who was a diplomat no doubt on his father's account vernon took the young gregg into his service as his secretary but had to dismiss him for his ill qualities according to gilbert burnet gregg was indeed an unsuitable choice for such a position as he had a criminal record and had narrowly escaped being found guilty of counterfeiting in his wife who attempted to take all the blame on herself was found guilty and despite being pregnant was sentenced to being branded on the hand nevertheless when robert harley became secretary of state in he appointed gregg to an underclerkship in his office and even extended to him an exceptional amount of confidence that at any rate was one explanation for the disaster which ensued another which has the authority of the celebrated author daniel defoe then gregg's fellow secretary was that harley's office was always in a state of the most complete disorder and that papers of the gravest import were open to the inspection of every clerk doorkeeper or laundress in the establishment antagonism was at its height between godolphin and harley at the close of and the whigs were plotting to exclude harley from the privy council intelligence came from the postmaster at brussels that a packet of letters had been opened from the secretary's office and addressed to french minister michel chamillart and they contained copies of important state papers a covering note indicated that the copies were sent by gregg gregg was arrested on jan was examined by sunderland on january and forthwith committed to newgate he was tried at the old bailey on january for treasonable correspondence with france pleaded guilty and was sentenced to death the culprit pleaded in extenuation of his crime his poverty and heavy debts but swore positively that he had no accomplice in his crime he seems to have felt a strong sense of loyalty to harley despite his previous betrayal of him and refused steadfastly to implicate him the whig leaders however were eager to obtain evidence against harley and were in great hopes that the unfortunate man would say something to convict his chief of complicity the house of lords formed a committee of seven to examine gregg and placed upon it charles seymour duke of somerset and two other dukes besides thomas wharton marquess of wharton charles townshend viscount townshend charles montagu earl of halifax and john somers baron somers the committee went to newgate on february and informed gregg that if he would make a full confession he might rely upon the intercession of the house in spite of the temptation thus dangled before him the poor fellow adhered manfully to the truth of his first statement the committee had the cruelty to keep the condemned man in suspense for three months at length they sent queen anne a recommendation that the execution should take place bitterly disappointed at making no other discovery than that the business of the secretary's office was conducted in a strangely lax manner gregg was hanged and quartered at tyburn on april and his head was placed on westminster hall before he met his fate he delivered a paper to the ordinary in which he solemnly exculpated harley from all participation in his offence he also left a letter the contrite tenor of which was warmly commended by hearne harley found it necessary during the second week in february to resign his secretaryship but he had the generosity to allow gregg's widow a pension of fifty pounds annually out of his private purse john korsrud john korsrud is a canadian composer and jazz trumpeter life korsrud b who lives in vancouver british columbia canada is a

odessa for her numerous charitable works indio mariano indio mariano was an indigenous rebel against spain in in tepic nueva galicia now in the mexican state of nayarit the background with the arrival of the bourbons on the throne of spain in came a period of indio mariano one of them serious led by different men the first of these took place in tepic nueva galicia in january the second occurred in september in nuevo león the first rebellion juan hilario rubio an important man of tepic alcalde josé desiderio maldonado and the indigenous clerk juan francisco medina were the leaders of the first indio mariano rebellion these men circulated a proclamation for the crowning of a native of tlaxcala as rey de indias mariano primero mariano i king of the indies this was scheduled for january even before that date some pueblos were in open rebellion against the spanish the coronation however was frustrated the spanish officials were able to assemble a force of men and pieces of artillery relying largely on the local militia and the fleet in the harbor at san blas for the place and time this was an overwhelming force the three leaders and many other persons were taken prisoner many prisoners were taken in two battles one on january and one that day or shortly thereafter the indigenous offered little resistance and casualties were minimal the rebellion seemed to be over by january but the following week a second wave appeared the spanish forces suffered setbacks large groups of armed indians were seen in many places converging on tepic the spanish were forced to withdraw from various villages they too converged on tepic alarming rumors began to circulate that yaquis were approaching that to yumas were coming from the colorado river the rebellion and the rumors greatly alarmed viceregal officials in mexico city particularly since the mother country and therefore also the colony was at war with great britain they began to fear the possibility of a general indian uprising perhaps simultaneously with a british invasion the fears were relieved the following week reports came in contradicting the rumors of massive movements of warriors other reports arrived telling of indians returning peacefully to their villages on january captain leonardo pintado dispersed a group of armed rebels taking prisoners the emergency came to an end the spanish had taken approximately prisoners most of those arrested were sent to guadalajara however some died in jail in tepic of an unknown disease some on the march to guadalajara and some after arriving in guadalajara some of the spanish troops also suffered from the disease and some of them died juan hilario rubio was one of the rebels who died in guadalajara he was condemned postmortem to confiscation of his property demolition of his house and sowing of his fields with salt the two other leaders were condemned to six years of public labor in veracruz this was a sentence that often proved fatal most of the other surviving prisoners were released indio mariano also known as máscara de oro or golden mask was never crowned he was apparently a young indian itinerant beggar who showed up in tepic shortly before christmas in the company of an old mulatto and a child he claimed to be the son of a deceased governor of tlaxcala and to have grown up in luxury it may not have been true that indio mariano was a native of tlaxcala in a literal sense for the indian resistance of the time claiming a relationship to tlaxcala was asserting a claim to the special rights granted the indigenous of that place by hernán cortés at the time of the conquest indio mariano was never found however rights and titles claimed in connection with tlaxcalla persisted up until the time of the first mexican empire and may have even played a significant role in motivating some natives to side with the conservative forces during the french intervention there has been speculation that the promise of tlaxcalla may have played a part in the cristero rebellion due in part to the belief that the catholic rebels were awaiting pontifical approval before crowning an official prince of tlaxcalla as heir to a kingdom of the aztecs in fulfillment of the tlaxcalla compact one has to believe that the tlaxcalla compact may have given rise to the chicano legend of the return of the quetzalcuatl to unify a broken aztlan quetzalcuatl is the chief deity of the allied aztec tribes who unified themselves under tlaxcalla and the spanish when they liberated cholula from mexican control leading up to the conquest of tenochtitlan the second rebellion on september in nuevo león an indian by the name of juan josé garcía was apprehended stealing cattle he told the authorities he was mariano i or alejandro i these were names of kings mariano asserted that his royal birth and ancestry were documented by papal certificates that he had personally obtained in rome his case was transferred to the royal medical tribunal where he was diagnosed as mentally ill with melancholia he was ordered to the hospital of san hipólito for treatment hatem beg ordubadi hatem beg ordubadi persian حاتم بیگ اردوبادی was an iranian aristocrat from the ordubadi family who served as the grand vizier of the safavid king shah abbas i r from to biography background and early life hatem was the son of bahram khan ordubadi the lord of ordubad the homeland of the ordubadi family an iranian family which was descended from the medieval philosopher and polymath nasir hatem later succeeded his father as the lord of urdubad and received the title of beg lord due to local disagreements he resigned however and went to the royal court in the ensuing period he served as vizier of the governor of khoy however when the latter was dismissed later on hatem beg lost his job as well and settled again in ordubad and later ardabil his fortunes changed in the early rule of abbas i when he was appointed as the vizier of the governor of kerman vali beg yuz bashi afshar and was later made the accountant mostowfi of yazd vizierate under shah abbas i in hatem's brother abu taleb beg then the mostowfi was sent as an envoy to the ruler of the uzbeks abdullah khan ii who was trying to take herat from the safavids at the time abdullah khan ii was not interested in negotiations and had abu taleb beg executed by putting him in front of the mouth of a cannon as a result of this gruesome tale in relation to his close relative hatem beg was taken under abbas i's wings and in he appointed him as the mostowfi of all of iran while six months later he made him his grand vizier hatem beg who became known by his honorific of daulat trusty support of the state which was given to every safavid grand vizier demonstrated to be a statesman of noteworthy capacity during his tenure as grand vizier during his tenure he managed to form a highly potent state administration that allowed the country to persist to prosper under considerably less adept shahs after abbas i's death the safavid court historian iskandar beg munshi who was attached to the retinue of hatem beg states that he brought security into the lives of iranians and was a model for all in regard to the administration of justice his knowledge of accounting procedures and his organisation of divan affairs hatem beg was evenly held in high regard by the europeans the carmelite monk father paul simon recounted hatem beg's calmness in dealing with difficult tasks he describes how hatem beg used to despatch petitions in a morning and after having sat and given a hearing for six or seven hours would go out as serene as if he were coming from taking his horse for a walk aside from his administrative responsibilities hatem beg also distinguished him as a military commander in the consolidation of the country it was unusual for a person of iranian stock to be involved in military affairs the iranian statesman mirza salman jaberi who had served as grand vizier from to had as a result of his involvement in military affairs made the qizilbash hostile towards him who felt that their power had been usurped mirza salman jaberi was eventually murdered by the qizilbash hatem beg's involvement in military affairs however did not arouse the antagonism of the qizilbash which in the words of david blow was a sign of changing times in hatem beg together with a group of administrators and accountants were sent to the newly subdued province of gilan where they improved the structure of tax charge and contribution which supposedly was done at the demand of the residents who were discontent with the oppressive governorship of mehdi qoli khan shamlu more likely however this reform took place due to the economic capability the province offered its rich silk manufacture tea caviar and lumber encouraged abbas i to dispatch his most prominent officers to overhaul the economic system of the province in a just approach death and offspring hatem beg died in near urmia during an expedition he was buried in mashhad his son mirza taleb khan ordubadi succeeded him as grand vizier occupying the office till he was reappointed as grand vizier during the reign of shah safi r from until where he was assassinated by the eunuch saru taqi due to a personal hatred he had towards the ordubadi family the reason being that hatem beg had denied to give saru taqi's father a post which he had asked for madame d'oettlinger madame d'oettlinger or baroness d'oettlinger fl was the name used by a woman who

spanish first arrived on the island on november etymology agüeybana which has been interpreted by and century authors as meaning the great sun was the hereditary title shared by the family that ruled the theocratic monarchy of borikén governing the hierarchy over the rest of the regional chiefs or caciques like other nobiliary recognitions within taíno culture it was passed down through the maternal bloodline the spanish settlers hispanicized the title to be the equivalent of the european concept of kings with contemporary writers such as juan de castellanos and gonzalo fernández de oviedo y valdés employing the title of rey agüeybana english king agüeybana when referring to the second monarch to lead the taíno during the by the the terms king and cacique were used exchangeably by both local and spanish authors but a resurgence in the interest concerning taíno history during the century led to the popularization of native words and the latter term gained more lexical prominence arrival of the conquistadors agüeybaná received the spanish conquistador juan ponce de león upon his arrival in according to an old taíno tradition agüeybaná practiced the guatiao a taíno ritual in which he and juan ponce de león became friends and exchanged names ponce de león then baptized the cacique's mother into christianity and renamed her inés the cacique joined ponce de león in the exploration of the island after this had been accomplished agüeybaná accompanied the conquistador to the island of la española what today comprises the nations of the dominican republic and haiti where he was well received by the governor nicolás de ovando actions helped to maintain the peace between the taíno and the spaniards a peace which was to be the hospitality and friendly treatment that the spaniards received from agüeybaná made it easy for the spaniards to betray and conquer the island after a short period of peace the taínos were forced to work in the island's gold mines and in the construction of forts as slaves many taínos died as a result of the cruel treatment which they received death and aftermath upon death in his brother güeybaná better known as agüeybaná ii became the most powerful cacique in the island agüeybaná ii was troubled by the treatment of his people by the spanish and attacked them in battle the taínos were ultimately defeated at the battle of yagüecas taínos in puerto rico either abandoned the island were forced to labor as slaves or were killed by the spaniards to what till recently was thought resulted in a complete extinction however recent genetic studies revealed that taino is still very much present in the genome of puertoricans said studies published in between and revealed a narrative more indicative of assimilation and migrations to nearby islands rather than extinction many succumbed to the smallpox epidemic that attacked the islanders in legacy agüeybaná is admired in puerto rico for his dedication to his people and attempting to keep the peace puerto rico has named many public buildings and streets after him the city of bayamón has named a high school after him there is a street in caguas that honors him an avenue in the hato rey area of san juan is named after agüeybaná puerto rico once had an equivalent to the grammy award which was awarded annually and was called the agüeybaná de oro the golden

a walled garden so that they would not be discovered but a certain man looked over the wall and eventually greeted them saying that they looked like men that meant no hurt one of their company then asked his permission for them to stay there thinking perhaps he was the owner and he repeated the same words and went away they resumed their readings and suddenly the constable of islington appeared among them with six or seven other men armed and demanded that their books should be handed over arrest imprisonment and inquisition various people including the women present escaped either from the close or from the company as they were led away to the nearby but the men were divided into groups and taken away among the soldiers and were taken before sir roger cholmley and their names were

were offered the opportunity to be released from the newgate if they would hear a mass those who remained obstinate were then presented an inquisition of fourteen articles by edmund bonner to which they were required to make satisfactory answers or be condemned executions of the who had given their names thirteen remained constant to their principles and held out against the demands they were

specifically the physics of the inverse scattering problem and for commercializing analytical methods and instruments involving laser light scattering which are widely used in academia industry and government early life and education wyatt did undergraduate work at the university of chicago b sc and christ's college cambridge he received his from the university of illinois in and his from florida state university in where he first worked on the inverse scattering problem his work involved the development of a nuclear model of the scattering of neutrons by nuclei he was nominated by the

during the he worked for the aeronutronic division of ford motor company general research corporation in santa barbara california and the defense contractor wyatt founded his first company science spectrum inc in the company developed several instruments that could be used to study the inverse scattering problem they applied techniques to the detection of biological weapons and the monitoring of food quality these early instruments used a traditional single detector to scan a range of scattering angles shortly before the closure of the company in wyatt developed an instrument for light scattering mals in which a glass capillary containing a sample was surrounded by an array of detectors wyatt then founded wyatt technology corporation to develop and sell scientific instruments for light scattering and particle size measurement his instruments are used worldwide by universities government agencies the biotech industry and pharmaceutical companies wyatt's instruments are used in

de toto orbe it was written in four volumes from until and also included the outline of the coast of the americas a military secret at the time but remained unpublished the two preserved samples of the work are kept in bologna biblioteca comunale dell'archiginnasio and in paris bibliothèque nationale de france de summa totius orbis from until coppa prepared a shortened version of de toto orbe under the title de summa totius orbis this work contained systematically arranged woodcut maps named tabulae tables to be published in a book thus representing the first modern atlas though this

of de summa totius orbis and portolano bound in a single together with printed woodcut maps are kept in the sergej mašera maritime museum in piran this is probably the most precious cartographic work

burby died was a london bookseller and publisher of the elizabethan and early jacobean eras he is known for publishing a series of significant volumes of english renaissance drama including works by william shakespeare robert greene john lyly and thomas nashe beginnings burby sometimes confused with cuthbert burbage though there is no known connection between the two men was the son of edmund burby a farmer in erlsey bedfordshire cuthbert burby was apprenticed to the stationer william wright for eight years as of christmas and became a freeman full member of the stationers company on january he did business in london between and as his title pages attest his shops were located under saint mildred's church in the poultry at the royal exchange and in paul's churchyard at the sign of the swan he had a large flourishing respectable business early in his career as a publisher burby issued works in the famous controversy between thomas nashe and gabriel harvey curiously burby published works in their exchange by both nashe and harvey his connection it appears was not personal or ideological just business he also published nashe's the unfortunate traveller and lenten stuff shakespeare regarding shakespeare burby published two key editions of shakespearean works the first quarto of love's labor's lost printed by william white and the second quarto of romeo and juliet printed by thomas creede the title page of the states that that edition was newly corrected augmented and amended which has been interpreted to indicate that was issued as a deliberate correction and replacement for the defective the bad quarto printed by john danter in the title page of burby's of lll the earliest play text to be printed under shakespeare's name also claims that that edition was newly corrected and augmented which has been taken by some commentators as a possible indication of an earlier bad quarto of lll that has not survived burby had subsidiary connections with the shakespeare canon as well he published palladis tamia by francis meres which contains an important reference to shakespeare and a list of shakespearean works produced up to burby also published with no attribution of authorship the first two quartos of the taming of a shrew the early alternative version of shakespeare's the taming of the shrew also burby issued the two early quartos of edward iii the one play of the shakespeare apocrypha that is most commonly seen as having at least some of shakespeare's work in it other drama burby published a number of other plays attributed or anonymous during his career the cobbler's prophecy robert wilson george a greene or the pinner of wakefield a knack to know an honest man mother bombie john lyly orlando furioso robert greene burby's relationship with the texts of robert greene is worth noting in addition to orlando furioso burby issued greene's pamphlets the third and last part of and the repentance of robert greene both the play george a greene has sometimes been attributed to greene's pen burby often worked with the printers john danter and simon stafford as with many of the texts listed above other works also in burby published the second report of doctor faustus containing his appearances and the deeds of wagner an anonymous prose work that elaborated the story of the magician and which was written to capitalise on the success of marlowe's famous play doctor faustus and he published thomas lodge's wit's misery and the world's madness in burby published other books on a range of subjects he was one of the three publishers who issued robert allot's verse anthology england's parnassus in the other two being nicholas ling and thomas heyes he published many religious works as did all the publishers of his era and he issued some of the chivalric romances that were the of the age like the mirror of knighhood and champions of christendom post mortem the exact date of burby's death is not known though it fell between august and september in in burby's widow assigned his copyrights mainly of theological works to the publisher's former apprentice nicholas bourne bourn had printed no dramatic works in his career but was a successful publisher of news who worked for many years in partnership with nathaniel butter the overall quality of burby's work as a publisher has been variously evaluated commentators have complained about the quality of the printing in some of burby's texts while burby was not a printer it can be asserted that he should have employed better craftsmen it has even been argued that the printing in the bad quarto of romeo and juliet danter's is superior to the printing of the the good quarto of that is on the whole less carefully printed than gert van egen monument to king frederick ii and queen sophie in roskilde cathedral gert van egen i alternative names gert va egerem gert van eggernn mechelen c elsinore was a flemish sculptor who became a sculptor working for the royal danish court life little is known about his life he was likely trained in mechelen and was later a pupil or assistant in the antwerp workshop of cornelis floris de vriendt whose work was particularly popular in northern europe he was part of a group of pupils and assistants of cornelis floris who moved to countries situated on the baltic sea to take advantage of floris network and the international popularity of the floris style the baltic region was at the time politically relatively stable when compared to van egen's native home the spanish netherlands which were rife with religious persecution there was also less competition from other artists in these countries he was employed together with his brother peter in denmark at kronborg castle from to the principal architects of kronborg castle were his fellow flemings hans hendrik van paesschen and anthonis van obbergen whereas the sculptural work was coordinated by dutchman gert van groningen at this time king frederick ii of denmark had the medieval fortress radically transformed into a magnificent renaissance castle van egen was one of the best paid sculptors indicating that he had important responsibilities in the decoration of kronborg although there are no records as to what these were while his brother peter likely left with van obbergen for danzig upon completion of the work at kronborg castle gert stayed on in denmark to work for the danish royal family relief from frederick ii's tomb showing the siege of akershus fortress in bottom left oslo with st hallvard's cathedral frederick ii died in and a year later gert van egen was commissioned to make a monumental tomb of the king to be placed in roskilde cathedral the initiative came from the deceased king's son christian iv and widow dowager queen sophie van egen remained in the employ of the danish court for the rest of his life and raised a family in denmark work unlike some of his fellow flemings working in the baltic van egen not only worked on large monuments but he also produced works monuments the major documented monumental work that he worked on was the tomb for frederick ii in roskilde cathedral the instructions for the design of the tomb were that it should form a unity with the tomb of king christian iii designed by floris that was already placed in the cathedral it has been suggested that the design for the tomb was by the hand of the sculptor johan gregor van der schardt who was at the time probably working in denmark of particular interest are the reliefs on the sides of the monument they depict scenes from the king's campaign against dithmarschen in and from the northern seven years war that lasted from to one scene shows the siege of akershus fortress in oslo of van egen shows a virtuoso technique in the details of this work the figure of the reclining king on the tomb is also sculpted with precision work in addition to the tomb of frederick ii it is recorded that in van egen delivered to christian iv a closet with alabaster pieces probably he has also made some small portrait reliefs of frederick ii now at rosenborg and the nationalmuseum in stockholm and a few similar alabaster works of danish noblemen of the works four are still known to be extant there are two alabaster statuettes both signed with his initials ge one represents judith holding the head of holofernes and is now in a private collection in new york the other representing mercury is in the collection of the metropolitan museum in new york city these pieces demonstrate that van egen likely received his training primarily in mechelen the center of alabaster sculpture theodosius of sinai theodosius of sinai bulgarian теодосий синаитски macedonian теодосиј синаитски was a bulgarian priest

hays kansas during the cholera outbreak of and died of the disease and it is said that her ghost is still seen walking the area history she was the young wife of ephriam polly the hospital steward or male nurse during the cholera epidemic at fort hays in elizabeth was the hospital matron who helped sick and dying soldiers deal with what were for many the final hours of their lives in the evening she would often walk to the hill south of the fort now known as sentinel hill where she is said to have found some comfort and spiritual healing when it was apparent that she had contracted the disease herself she pleaded with her husband to bury her on top of the hill and she was indeed buried on the hill though not at the top according to the legend her gravesite was marked with four heavy limestone posts these posts were stolen by thieves in the early days of hays kansas the legend claims that tragedy found each of the thieves in the hours after the theft one felled in a gunfight two killed in a carriage accident and the other hit by a train sadly due to the thefts her exact gravesite has long been lost some contend that the grave found at the base of the hill was not polly's being instead that of a mexican cattleman based on the marker's spanish inscription in fact the lonely grave as it is called may not be an actual burial site at all as no remains were found in attempts to fulfill miss polly's wishes by moving her to the top of the hill the actual sentinel hill is completely made of bedrock making it a highly unlikely burial ground multiple attempts to locate her exact burial site have been made and surprisingly multiple bodies have been exhumed but none was conclusively shown to be that of elizabeth polly blue light lady to most people who live in hays she is known as the blue light lady her spirit is said to still walk the hill looking to comfort her soldiers many people have made attempts to witness her spirit firsthand some have claimed that she has appeared wearing a blue dress and bonnet while others claim that she is a misty blue light other people have claimed that while waiting at the top of the hill for elizabeth's spirit to arrive footsteps have been heard walking up the hill and suddenly disappearing at the top yet nobody was to be found around the hill one specific event was reported in when a police officer radioed a report to dispatch saying that he had just hit a woman dressed in blue not far from the hill he then quickly exited his car and searched for a body none was ever found memorials today there is a monument to her on the top of sentinel hill put there in a park dedicated to her was established in hays in and it includes an elizabeth polly statue francine hérail francine hérail is a french historian

anderson freemason for other people with the same name see james anderson dr james anderson c was a scottish writer and minister born and educated in aberdeen scotland he was ordained a minister in the church of scotland in and moved to london where he ministered to the glass house street congregation until to the presbyterian church in swallow street until and at lisle street chapel until his death he is reported to have lost a large sum of money in the south sea company crash of anderson is best known however for his association with freemasonry biography he was the brother of adam anderson james was born about in aberdeen where he was educated and probably took the degrees of and in he was appointed minister of the presbyterian church in swallow street london whence he was transferred in to a similar charge in lisle street leicester fields according to the gentleman's magazine he is said to have been well known among the people of that persuasion resident in london as bishop anderson and he is described as a learned but imprudent man who lost a considerable part of his property in the fatal year several of his sermons were printed one of them no preached in on the anniversary of the execution of charles i was a zealous defence of the conduct of the presbyterians during the civil wars and reached a second edition anderson was a freemason and when in on the revival of freemasonry in england the grand lodge determined to produce an authoritative digest of the constitutions of the fraternity the task was assigned to him entick's edition of the constitutions et seq it was as a grand warden of the lodge that he presented to it on completing his task the constitutions of the containing the history charges regulations c of that most ancient and right worshipful fraternity for the use of the lodges london in the year of masonry anno domini this work which passed through several editions was long recognised by the english freemasons to be the standard code on its subject and was translated into german an american facsimile of the first edition of was issued at new york city in and there are reprints of the same edition in cox's old constitutions belonging to the freemasons of england and ireland and in the first volume of kenning's masonic archæological library anderson also contributed to masonic literature a defence of masonry occasioned by a pamphlet called masonry dissected which was translated into german and is reprinted in golden remains of the early masonic writers by george oliver freemasonry anderson was a freemason the master of a masonic lodge and a grand warden of the grand lodge of london and westminster he was commissioned in september by the grand lodge to write a history of the and it was published in as the constitutions of the anderson's name does not appear on the title page but his authorship is declared in an appendix anderson's work although of the first importance to the history of freemasonry is unfortunately marred by a number of extravagant claims which are simply incredible indeed it was shown at the tercentenary conference of the respected quatuor coronati research lodge at queen's college cambridge that anderson's history of the founding of the grand lodge is doubtful since the public houses mentioned could probably not have accommodated the meetings that he claims were held in anderson's account must be broadly accurate having been widely published within six years of the events described but it may have been backdated by two or three years perhaps to aggrandise some brethren as past grand officers works in appeared the work by which anderson is chiefly remembered royal genealogies or the genealogical tables of emperors kings and princes from adam to these times professedly based on genealogische tabellen of johann hübner it was largely supplemented by anderson's industry while the earlier sections of the work are of little historical value the later are often of use in relation to the genealogies of continental dynasties and houses the volume closes with a synopsis of the english peerage and in the preface the author intimated his readiness if adequately encouraged to delineate and dispose at full length the genealogies of all the peers and great gentry of the britannic isles anderson's last work which he was commissioned to undertake by the first earl of egmont and his son from materials furnished by them bore the title a genealogical history of the house of yvery in its different branches of yvery lovel perceval and gournay but the first volume alone was completed when anderson died on may and a second volume subsequently published was due to another pen see to the reader in vol ii the work was soon withdrawn from circulation on account of some disparaging remarks in it on the condition of the english peerage and on the character of the irish people it was however without the offensive passages in see notes and queries series and letters of horace walpole n and much of the genealogical matter in the book has been pronounced to be mythical drummond's histories of noble british families art percival another work of anderson's news from elysium or dialogues of the dead between leopold roman emperor and louis xiv king of france was published shortly after his death in the constitutions was edited and reprinted by benjamin franklin in philadelphia in becoming the first masonic book printed in america an electronic edition of that work is online a second london edition much expanded appeared in the work was translated into many languages including dutch german and french his other published works include royal genealogies or the genealogical tables of emperors kings and princes a defence of masonry news

the death of the lord chancellor sir christopher hatton november and the appointment of his successor he remained however attached to the northern circuit apparently until his retirement in he took the lincoln assizes with anderson the bulk of the criminal business consisting as it would seem of cases of ecclesiastical recusancy the unknown writer of a letter preserved in the fourth volume of strype's annals says the demeanour of him anderson a zealous high churchman and the other judge as they sit by turns upon the gaol with reverence i speak it in these matters is flat opposite and they which are maliciously affected when mr justice clinch sitteth upon the gaol do labour to adjourn their complaints though they be before upon the file to the next assize and the gentlemen in the several shires are endangered by this means to be cast into a faction strype annals fol iv clench is said to have been an especial favourite with elizabeth nevertheless he does not appear to have been knighted or in any way honoured in while retaining the emoluments of his office he was displaced from attendance at court on account of age and infirmities and three years later he was pensioned he

little bear born ayimâsis or macquettoquet was a cree leader who lived in the alberta idaho montana and saskatchewan regions of canada and the united states in the and early centuries he is known for his participation in the rebellion which was fought in alberta and saskatchewan early life son of tribal leader big bear his exact date of birth is unknown but some assume it to be in the one account has him being years old in while another said little bear was already in his in he may have been born in the early or he was probably living in the idaho montana and wyoming region in the little bear said in butte montana in either or that his father lived along the snake river in idaho but relocated to the butte montana region to hunt for buffalo and other wild game the black hills war little bear was said to have participated in the great sioux war of or black hills war however nearly all the battles of that war were fought in montana and northeastern wyoming after the war many cree fled north to canada and west into british columbia idaho oregon and washington but little bear and his family continued to live in extreme northern montana treaty of fort industry apparently a different native of the name little bear was at the signing of the treaty of fort industry but this could not have been the little bear discussed here as he was not born yet at that time in july little bear along with leaders from wyandot ottawa chipawa munsee and delaware shawanee and pottawatima nations signed the treaty of fort industry with the united states government at fort industry in ohio this treaty ceded their lands to the us government but allowed for the tribes to continue to hunt and fish in the lands that they formerly owned the rebellion and aftermath in early the cree living in central alberta and central saskatchewan fought and lost in the rebellion against canada frog lake massacre during the rebellion wandering spirit led a group of soldiers including little bear into attacking the tiny settlement of frog lake alberta they killed nine whites in what became known as the frog lake massacre return to montana after the rebellion ended little bear and lucky man knowing the canadian whites were after them fled the two gathered many of their people and journeyed back to montana they slipped through the babb montana region in and hid out in that region and then roamed about their original montana homeland they frequented the land on and around the flathead reservation which the flathead indians agent did not like little bear was considered the leader of the ojibwas of the basin montana region southwest montana deportation montana native and peoples did not welcome little bear and his group saying he had not been born in the united states they called for little bear and the ojibwas he led to be deported to canada for the first couple of years after returning to their original montana homeland many of little bear's people roamed throughout the vast blackfeet reservation on the side of the line in the united states reduced the size of the blackfeet reservation and divided it into three small reservations the blackfeet reservation fort belknap reservation and the fort peck reservation life got harder for little bear and his people and they often went hungry in the united states deported little bear lucky man and hundreds of other landless cree and ojibwas of montana back to canada little bear and lucky man feared the death penalty for their participation in the attacks at frog lake when they arrived in canada they were apprehended one account has it they stood trial for their part in the massacre and were acquitted of the charges while another says no charges were laid against little bear as the magistrate said the evidence did not deem charges it is noticeable that little bear is listed among the eight natives hanged on nov at battleford so perhaps the government did not want the confusion or mistaken identity to come out in public little bear settled in canada perhaps at onion lake and in travelled with rev john mcdougall to ottawa to complain of the treatment of his people by the government he soon returned to montana efforts to gain a reservation little bear knew he had to follow the chippewa leader rocky boy if the landless nations of montana were to gain reservations in rocky boy and little bear attempted to gain either a reservation or tribal recognition on the flathead reservation the bill to make the flathead reservation for other landless tribes failed in in and around little bear contacted canadian leaders to request land for some of the cree of montana at least five first nations were set aside for the chippewa of montana they are the onion lake samson ermineskin louis bull and montana first nations in little bear and his tribe joined the rocky boy reservation the babb chippewa reservation in the united states set aside a new chippewa reservation within the blackfeet reservation in montana between saint mary lake babb and the canada us border chief rocky boy was the first to settle there followed by little bear and the people he led in all around chippewa and cree people settled there rocky boy reservation since hundreds of chippewas and cree continued to remain landless rocky boy and little bear stepped up their efforts to get another reservation set aside in montana rocky boy's brother pennahto told little bear to request the old fort assiniboine military reservation be set aside as a new reservation neither pennahto nor rocky boy lived to see the establishment of rocky boy reservation after rocky boy reservation was officially established in little bear became its first chairman he was already an old man at the time little bear died in at or nearly eighty years of age william craven lord mayor of london sir william craven by marcus gheeraerts the younger sir william craven july was an english merchant lord mayor of london in some sources say also in it has been noted that the story of dick whittington has some similarities to craven's career though the story was first published before craven became lord mayor life he was the second son of william craven and beatrix daughter of john hunter and grandson of john craven was born at appletreewick a village in the parish of burnsall near skipton in the west riding of yorkshire about the date is made probable by the fact that he took up his freedom in at the age of thirteen or fourteen he was sent down to london by the common carrier and bound apprentice to robert hulson merchant taylor who lived in

built by stephen kirton in the parish of st andrew undershaft cornhill this house was on the south side of leadenhall street it was leased to the east india company in and pulled down and the east india house erected in during craven's mayoralty his name appears in connection with loans to the king in lady elizabeth coke wife of sir edward coke on occasion of her quarrel with her husband was at his request handed over to the hospitality of craven who must have entertained her at his house in leadenhall street the last public act recorded of craven is the laying of the of the new aldgate on

school in burnsall north yorkshire in this building has been in use as a school ever since then and now houses burnsall v a primary school the inscription william craven alderman of london founder of this schoole anno domini can still be seen on a panel above the school door in he was one of the patrons of the scheme of a new college after the manner of a university designed at ripon yorkshire on january he was elected president of christ's hospital a post he occupied up to his death his donations to the hospital included lands to the value of at ugley in essex on july he conveyed to st john's college the advowson of creeke in northamptonshire upon trust that one of the ten senior fellows elected from merchant taylors school should be presented thereto in he joined with others in subscribing towards the repair and decoration of st antholin's church by john craven's will dated may he left large charitable bequests to burnsall skipton ripon ripley knaresborough and boroughbridge and money for redeeming captives in algiers his most important legacy was that of the manor of cancerne near chichester sussex to provide for four poor scholars two at cambridge and two at oxford with preference to his own poor kinsmen the first award under the bequest was made at cambridge may the fund was immediately afterwards sequestrated by parliament and on may a petition was presented for the payment of the scholarships in the sequestration was discharged the bequest was maintained at both universities eyo honesty ii king eyo honesty ii was the ruler of creek town from approximately to when he died creek town was part of the old calabar region in the bight of biafra old calabar was a series of towns up the cross river which is in the southeast edge of nigeria honesty is an example of african agency in the atlantic slave trade because he was a strong savvy and intelligent leader who worked with the europeans instead of against them which brought about changes that would forever affect the region early life although his exact date of birth is unknown eyo was cited to have been born in by an epitaph located on a tower of the creek town presbyterian church as a child eyo served as a cabin boy to english traders in the triangle trade network it was during this time that he learned to speak and write the english language he also learned the ways of the slave trade and how to do business which would benefit him as a ruler later on in life after his father lost the throne his family fell upon hard times and eyo found himself in the employment of his father's rival the great duke ephraim after his father died in working for the duke in duke town another town in the calabar region allowed him to improve his english and trade skills while establishing himself coming to power honesty's father eyo nsa eyo i ruled creek town before him but there was a break between them caused by legitimacy claims to the throne this ultimately resulted in eyo i being removed from power as the great duke ephraim made claims over the entire calabar region eyo while serving in duke town began to contact distant family in an effort to get them to come back to creek town and a lineage in the eyo ii house was formed and the great duke ephraim died allowing eyo to be crowned in or the date is uncertain his rule of the region would be marked with political agency through cooperation instead of confrontation with the europeans european interaction honesty welcomed the europeans with open arms instead of fighting them with everything he had like some rulers in the area did and had done he saw them as educated learned men who could help him establish a stronger political hold in the region through economic power eyo had experience with white traders from the travels of his youth and he continued his connections through the slave trade network that had been in place for decades before him he had dealt in slaves from both selling and buying as he was trying to employ enough men to run his aspiring palm oil industry his relationships with these huge trading outfits of the triangular trade network were well fostered and even gained him the name honesty for his fair trade policies and willingness to work with the european traders however in a commander raymond issued eyo honesty ii and king eyamba v another ruler in the region papers that negotiated the end of the slave trade on december honesty returned the signed trade treaty to raymond but took the opportunity to expand the economic market of creek town to compensate for the loss of slave trade eyo invited the europeans into his lands to set up industries that would diversify the economy such industries to come would be cotton coffee sugar cane and an immense increase in palm oil which had existed alongside of the slave trade religion with the invite extended to the europeans missionaries were some of the first to come these people coming to do god's work would influence the politics of the region more than any of the economic changes in the region in the first missionaries arrived in creek town these missionaries were the precursors to the presbyterian church previously mentioned that sports eyo's epitaph upon their arrival eyo was cited saying now i am sure god will love and bless me for i am very glad you come with this book although honesty's kingdom was efik a pagan religion eyo still appreciated and respected the missionaries and their christianity his respect for the missionaries ultimately resulted in law changes over his domain such reforms include the elimination of human sacrifice the allowance of widows and twins to return to creek town the elimination of ekpenyong the household idol of the region and the ending of sunday markets in addition to altering laws eyo also translated the church services put on by the missionaries mainly rev waddell eyo maintained his agency by collaborating with the europeans who encountered his kingdom and left a reputation that is best stated in religion in calabar by rosalind hackett the efik epitomized by king eyo honesty showed the capacity to adapt internally to modernize without becoming westernized or christianized aline miller aline fiona miller is a professor of biomolecular engineering at the university of manchester she specialises in the characterisation of polymer biopolymer and peptides using neutron and scattering as well as the development of functionalised nanostructures for regenerative medicine and toxicology testing early life and education miller studied chemistry at the university of strathclyde and graduated in she was an undergraduate exchange student at franklin marshall college miller joined durham university as a post graduate student earning a phd in under the supervision of randal richards miller worked on graft copolymers which included polynorbornene and oxide and studied their organisation at interfaces after completing her doctorate miller moved to new hall college at the university of cambridge where she was appointed a junior research fellow and she worked with athene donald on cellulose she was inspired to have a career in research during this fellowship research and career miller joined the university of manchester institute of science and technology umist in she was made a full professor in she continued to investigate the behaviour of molecules at different interfaces including the and interface surfactants and polymers can be used to promote or inhibit the crystallisation of small molecules for example the use of hydroxyl based polymers in the crystallisation of ice cream to mimic how fish use macromolecules to stop their blood freezing miller combines antifreeze proteins with ice crystals in miller established the university of manchester polymers peptides research group here she works on the characterisation of polymer biopolymer and peptides using neutron and scattering the characterisation of these materials allows miller to tailor them for specific applications miller also works in biomedical engineering creating scaffolds through the control of proteins and peptides she explores the relationship between mesoscopic structure material properties and cell response she has studied how proteins including what causes them to unfold and form fibril structures the morphology roughness porosity and mechanical properties such as young's modulus and viscosity can be controlled through the peptides can be conjugated with polymers that are sensitive to ph and temperature through the synthesis of short peptides with various amino acid sequences the miller group are studying the of beta sheets she has developed a biocompatible biodegradable cardiac patch created from a thick porous scaffold coated with a material that mimics the extracellular matrix she also studies the degradation mechanism of these materials miller was awarded a small grant from the university of manchester to develop the synthesis of hydrogels the synthetic peptide hydrogels were so successful that she set up the company peptigeldesign a group which worked to commercialise hydrogel technologies since peptigeldesig n have raised over million in funding recognising the reach and potential of peptigeldesign the company relaunched as manchester biogel in continuing to offer hydrogels amongst other biomaterials the hydrogels can be used to improve the quality of drug toxicity testing dna sensing and regenerative medicine awards and honours her awards and honours include university of strathclyde william marr dux award

scientist at the university of manchester they have three children anna karlsdotter anna karlsdotter vinstorpa died was a swedish noble and landholder by her daughter ebba eriksdotter vasa she was the maternal grandmother of queen margaret leijonhufvud and thereby great grandmother of king john iii of sweden and king charles ix of sweden she is remembered as one of several possible people later identified with the famous legend of pintorpafrun biography anna karlsdotter was the daughter of noble riksråd karl bengtsson of the vinstorpa family and katarina karin lagesdotter sparre d and sister of knight and riksråd örjan karlsson d in she married to riksråd lord erik karlsson vasa of stäkeholm and rumlaborg a cousin of erik johansson vasa father of gustav i of sweden she became a widow when her husband was shot in for harassing a priest in she remarried erik eriksson gyllenstierna the younger who was lynched in for having capitulated to the danes at älvsborg she had many children among them ebba eriksdotter vasa and margareta von melen upon the death of her childless brother she became the last descendant of the vinstorpa family iii and the heir of the family estates after having been widowed a second time she bought the manor pinntorp in sudermannia in and devoted the rest of her life to the management of her estates in addition to the estates she inherited she expanded her lands by acquired more and more land in västergötland over a period of almost fifty years and became a very substantial rich and noted landowner in for example her borrowed money from her to be able to lodge her daughter ebba and their children in västerås abbey while he attended the coronation in stockholm something that saved them from the stockholm bloodbath upon the marriage of her granddaughter margaret leijonhufvud to the king in she benefited as did all the relatives of margaret and was granted land and privileges such as the right to certain taxes and fines from the king as a landowner anna has been pointed out as one of the possible people identified with pintorpafrun the infamous pintorpa lady known for torturing her tenants to death while she did own the estate pintorpa there are no sources which portray her as cruel and a more likely person behind the pintorpafrun is barbro eriksdotter bielke she was however known for being a firm and tough businessperson who did not hesitate to involve in conflict and court cases over inheritance and land disputes in her accumulation of land and during the she was reportedly involved in a number of court cases over land with several members of the royal council in contrast to her daughter ebba eriksdotter vasa and granddaughter margaret leijonhufvud lady anna does not appear to have been a supporter of the catholic church in her business ambitions she took advantage of the new law introduced by the swedish reformation which allowed for people to retract property donated to the church by their ancestors in accordance with the reduction of gustav i of sweden and confiscated property from the skara church by retracting the donation letters on her own accord and without asking for the necessary permit from the king more or less by force but was ordered in a strict letter from the king to give it back to his majesty she was also reprimanded by the king for having expanded her estates and founded more farms than she was allowed to thereby having intruded on the both the land of the king as well as the common land of the peasantry domenico prattichizzo domenico prattichizzo is an italian

place of residence was hilo which was called byron's bay by the foreigners at the time after george byron baron byron who brought the bodies of king kamehameha ii and queen kamāmalu back from london aboard hms blonde even after the arrival of the missionaries koahou never converted to christianity or if he ever did he didn't take their religious teaching very seriously on december rev artemas bishop complained how koahou's behavior and continual practice of polygamy were discouraging the natives of hilo from converting preached morning and evening at the usual place of worship the house was filled and good attention paid in general to the word but it is to be regretted that no better example is set and in general no more countenance given to religious things by koahou the principal chief at this place he still retains three wives and revels in all the abominations of heathenism while neither he or his people are often at church such an example from a principal chief has a pernicious effect upon the common people and accordingly there are found more open opposers among the natives at this than at any other station koahou died in at a place called punahou near hilo it isn't known whether he left any descendants or what happened to his lands and properties after his death but they were probably inherited by his sister peleuli and her descendants ancestry nzewi c

august moses of mardin moses of mardin latin moses mardenus was a syriac orthodox priest and bishop who played a significant role in printing the first syriac bible and served as perhaps the first syriac in europe biography moses was born in the village of qaluq near mardin in the tur abdin region moses is first mentioned in as an envoy of the jacobite patriarch of antioch ignatius abdullah i stephan to rome to seek the means to print syriac copies of the new testament his mission also included negotiations of unity with the catholic church in anticipation of the patriarch's arrival whilst in rome moses stayed in the monastery of st stephen of the abyssinians where johannes potken had printed the first ge'ez book psalterium david et cantica aliqu here he printed a syriac manuscript with the assistance of the cardinals marcello cervini reginald pole and jean du bellay however the manuscript produced was defective as the printers did not understand the language in moses travelled to venice to meet guillaume postel to promote the idea of printing a syriac copy of the new testament which postel had been working on since despite this postel could not help print it as he did not have the characters to print in syriac in moses then returned to rome where he taught syriac to andreas masius and johann albrecht widmannstetter among others upon the advice of masius he left rome in the company of cardinal pole as he was returning to england to meet johann jacob fugger in augsburg however whilst staying in dillingen he met johann albrecht widmanstetter then chancellor of the austrian lands both sharing the same goals of printing a syriac copy of the new testament widmanstetter travelled with moses to vienna where they convinced ferdinand i to fund their project thus one thousand copies of the syriac version of the new testament was printed in and moses himself received half of which to distribute in the east moses remained in europe until before returning to the east however before departing he sold copies on the european market in he is mentioned returning to rome as a bishop accompanied by the deposed patriarch ignatius nemet allah i in moses was appointed professor of

sṭephanos to rome where he arrived with a few mss in or shortly before the aim of the mission was to search for syriac printed books or for opportunities to produce them whether mushe was additionally entrusted with the delicate task of improving relations between the syr orth and the roman catholic church remains disputed mushe lived in rome and traveled through europe until some time after in rome he established contacts with some of the earliest western scholars interested in syriac among them were guillaume postel johann albrecht widmanstetter and andreas masius he collaborated with widmanstetter in the publication of the first edition of the syriac nt which appeared in vienna in and whose syriac typeface derived from handwriting mushe served as syriac teacher in rome and the latter frequently consulted him in particular while he was preparing his syrorum peculium a syriac glossary that was included in vol of the antwerp polyglot mushe and masius corresponded in syriac a number of letters belonging to the period are preserved masius also translated into latin a profession of faith that mushe is said to have made in and which masius included in one of his later publications its exact status remains unclear during his time in europe mushe copied many syriac mss several of these are extant including the remarkable ms london brit libr harley which contains parts of the roman missal in latin written in serṭo script along with three syriac anaphoras mushe wrote it for the bp of the abyssinian convent san stefano in rome where he often resided and it shows his interest in and familiarity with the catholic liturgy after mushe returned to the middle east where he copied some further mss among them michael chronicle probably from the autograph and where the solely honorific title of metropolitan bp was conferred on him he returned to rome probably in the company of patr niʿmatullāh following the abdication in in rome he copied and annotated several

english actor of the elizabethan era and the owner and manager of the boar's head theatre he was also part of an enduring confusion in the study of english renaissance theatre two robert brownes the relevant documents of english renaissance drama contain numerous references to robert browne early scholars like e k chambers and edwin nunzeger assumed that these records referred to a single individual later scholars principally charles jasper sissons and herbert berry argued persuasively that two separate individuals had been confused and conflated into one or two at least there were obviously at least two and could easily have been three or more robert brownes who had to do with the companies and playhouses of the time to distinguish between two robert brownes the earliest years of the seventeenth century are key one robert browne was busy running the boar's head theatre in through another robert browne was performing with english actors in germany between and the boar's head browne died in and so can reasonably be termed an elizabethan actor the career of the other robert browne extended through the first two decades of the seventeenth century he can sensibly be called a jacobean actor the elizabethan actor the robert browne who is the subject of this article was the man who ran the boar's head theatre and who was married to susan browne later susan greene later susan baskervile and the father of their five children including the actor william browne browne of the boar's head was in all likelihood the browne who was a leader among the acting troupe derby's men and who received payments for court performances by derby's men in and a robert browne wrote to edward alleyn in when the subject of this article died in october joan alleyn wrote the news to her husband the later robert browne wrote to alleyn in showing that the alleyns knew both men concerning edward alleyn and the two brownes one scholar has written from the scanty record it would appear that the first was of particular interest to alleyn but not on good terms while the second appears from occasional notes to alleyn to have been confident and respectful it is not impossible that there was a family relationship between the two brownes since familial connections were common among actors and theatre people in the era consider john and lawrence dutton in queen elizabeth's men anthony and humphrey jeffes in the admiral's men a generation later plus robert pallant father and son apparently and other such pairs to compound the confusion both robert brownes had sons named robert browne

received many gifts although he sent most of the gifts given to him by the wealthy back while he was governor the flooding of the nile caused widespread drought in egypt leading to his dismissal from the office in march or april his defterdar finance minister hasan having become the acting governor kaymakam after hüseyin pasha's removal accused him of having embezzled money from the treasury and crops from the granary and prevented him from leaving cairo hüseyin pasha paid gold pieces dinars half of the claimed amount and claimed that a local who had disparaged him after his removal from

to be transferred to swamiji in any way one day both he and his wife had a dream where swamiji had blessed their son and he was normal again since both of them had the same dream they thought the message was too strong to ignore so with hopes filled in their hearts they went to shirali to meet swamiji the entire family prayed in utmost humility to swamiji the boy was weeping bitterly but

heart was rich with devotion en route his feet got swollen and his knees became very tired with all his energy sapped and the destination still far away the poor man rested under a banyan tree very dejected and doubtful of completing his journey at night he had a dream where swamiji came to him under the banyan tree and was massaging his tired feet with oil at dawn when he woke up all the pain and agony had disappeared and he could walk normally with his health and spirits the devotee made his way to swamiji at shirali and fell at his feet with true devotion the swamiji blessed him and the devotee returned with content and happiness shishya sweekār when swamiji's health started becoming frail and weak the devotees requested swamiji to accept a shishya disciple swamiji graciously accepted the offer so the search was on to find a suitable successor the suitable successor was found in a youngster from the shukla bhat family from shirali on the shuddha panchami day of the ashādhā month in the new shishya was ordained as vāmanāshram he would be under the tutelage of swami keshavāshram for another years this long period of being under a guru helped vāmanāshram attain high proficiency in the sanskrit scriptures death after being the head of the community for long years swami keshavāshram died on the shīrsha navami day of the mārgha month in he died with his shishya by his side his samādhi shrine is located at shirali francis moore geographer francis moore baptized died in or after was a british travel writer of the eighteenth century moore was born in worcester england but few details are known about his early life he came into prominence after publishing travels into the inland parts of africa in the abolitionist thomas clarkson attributed his commitment to the cause to reading the few experts on africa of the time including moore account of africa moore was appointed a writer clerk by the royal african company in and sailed for the gambia river entrepôt on july of that year he left the region in april after also serving as a factor agent for the company moore was one of the first englishmen to travel into the interior of africa serving in and visiting numerous towns and trading posts along the gambia river from its mouth to the guinea highlands hundreds of miles inland observations were published as travels into the interior parts of africa the short account describes in rich detail the physical and cultural geography of the region before the intensification of the atlantic slave trade and the resulting depopulation and economic disintegration work and richard the golden trade were the only detailed accounts of gambia before the colonial period excerpts from travels into the interior parts of africa were published in several subsequent volumes on exploration and the slave trade including samuel johnson et al the world displayed thomas astley s a new general collection of voyages and travels and elizabeth documents illustrative of the slave trade to america association with job ben solomon moore related the saga of job ben solomon also known as ayuba suleiman diallo in travels into the interior parts of africa job was an african aristocrat taken by slavers in in an incident recorded by moore he was enslaved in maryland until when he was sent to england after james oglethorpe received a letter from him and purchased his freedom after becoming and respected in london society job returned to the gambia where he became with moore account of the georgia colony moore sailed to the province of georgia on november only four months after returning to england from gambia with james oglethorpe and over colonists it was a return trip for oglethorpe who had founded the colony in february among those also on the voyage were newly ordained brothers john wesley and charles wesley moore served as oglethorpe's secretary and as storekeeper at fort frederica on the southern frontier of the georgia colony he served in the colony until visiting his homeland once before permanently returning to england the same year as oglethorpe early observations in the colony were published under the title a voyage to georgia the account contains some of the most detailed information available on the oglethorpe plan and its implementation account of georgia is silent on emerging position however it seems likely that the two men discussed africa and the slave trade at length and this may have informed the views andrew pollard andrew pollard is head of research impact at the institute of education university

tisquesusa depicted in tisquesusa also spelled thisquesuza thysquesuca or thisquesusha died facatativá was the fourth and last independent ruler zipa of bacatá main settlement of the southern muisca between and his death in the name brought about the colombian capital bogotá tisquesusa was the ruler of the southern muisca confederation at the time of the spanish conquest of the muisca when the troops led by gonzalo jiménez de quesada and his brother entered the central colombian highlands his zaque counterpart in the northern area of the muisca was quemuenchatocha biography tisquesusa was cacique of chía and following the muisca heritage rules he as nephew of the previous ruler nemequene succeeded his uncle in at the start of his reign tisquesusa fought against the panche in the west of the muisca confederation the brother of tisquesusa and later according to muisca heritage rule illegal successor sagipa was the general in the southern muisca army early on in his reign tisquesusa went to war with the northern muisca ruled by quemuenchatocha forty thousands guecha warriors of the southern muisca fought against fifty thousand northern muisca earlier support of the iraca sugamuxi of the iraca valley helped the northern troops in their battles but this time the third party helped settling a truce between both parties which lasted until the arrival of the spanish conquistadores in the spanish conquest main article spanish conquest of the muisca the arrival of the spanish conquerors was revealed to tisquesusa by the mohan popón from the village of ubaque he told the muisca ruler that foreigners were coming and tisquesusa would die bathing in his own blood when tisquesusa was informed of the advancing invasion of the spanish soldiers he sent a spy to suesca to find out more about their army strength weapons and with how many warriors they could be beaten the zipa left the capital bacatá and took shelter in nemocón which directed the spanish troops to there during this march attacked by more than muisca warriors when tisquesusa retreated in his fortified place in cajicá he allegedly told his men he would not be able to combat against the strong spanish army in possession of weapons that produced thunder and lightning he chose to return to bacatá and ordered the capital to be evacuated resulting in an abandoned site when the spanish arrived in search for the muisca ruler the conquistadores went north to find tisquesusa in the surroundings of facatativá where they attacked him at night tisquesusa was thrusted by the sword of one of de quesada's soldiers but without knowing he was the zipa he let him go after taking the expensive mantle of the ruler tisquesusa fled hurt into the mountains and died of his wounds there his body was only discovered a year later because of the black vultures circling over it at the death of tisquesusa his son hama and daughter machinza hid the sister of the zipa usaca in one of the settlements on the bogotá savanna when one of the conquistadors juan maría cortés found out about this he prepared a battle to gain control over the area at that moment usaca appeared and resisted against the spanish conqueror legend tells that he dropped his weapons and fell in love with her eventually marrying the sister of tisquesusa and they were baptised in usaquén meaning land of the sun in muysccubun this formed the start of the construction of a colonial village today part of the capital and known for its colonial architecture and parks succession to the throne contrary to muisca tradition where the eldest son of the oldest sister of the previous ruler would become the next zipa the reign was taken over by tisquesusa's brother his army general sagipa this would be the last ruler of the southern muisca defeated in and died of spanish torture in early tisquesusa in muisca history modern historical revisionism in investigations in the century about the existence of tisquesusa doubt has been cast on his name the name tisquesusa originates from the work elegías de varones ilustres de indias written by poet juan de castellanos decades after the events of the conquest in his work he names tisquesusa as the zipa while other researchers such as jorge gamboa mendoza maintain the name was bogotá note later scholars such as pedro simón simply took the names from earlier sources without verifying them marsha i

currently works on modeling the stability of this radical and its conformers currently her group focuses on chemistry of criegee intermediates an intermediate in the alkene ozonolysis pathway this pathway is a primary oxidation pathway for alkenes in the troposphere and generates atmospheric hydroxyl radicals her lab synthesizes criegee intermediates in order to further study their chemical reactions using spectroscopy her lab also currently focuses on modeling and observing the collisional quenching of excited hydroxyl radicals quenching impacts the concentration of hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere and is therefore of environmental interest her research group at the university of pennsylvania was behind the development of open shell complexes awards national academy of sciences

australia returning to england in gore joined the botanist joseph banks who had also been on cook's first pacific voyage in a private scientific expedition to iceland and the hebrides gore and banks may have become friends as evidence shows that banks was the executor of gore's will the trip did not return until after cook had sailed on his second pacific voyage however in gore answered the call from cook and the admiralty once again and joined hms resolution as first lieutenant for cook's third voyage as the resolution explored the pacific in search of the famed northwest passage gore would sight the american continent of his birth from the west coast later following cook's death in hawaii charles clerke captain of resolution's sister ship hms discovery took command gore then assumed command of discovery in clerke's place when clerke himself died shortly after gore took responsibility for the entire expedition unaware that his place of birth had declared its independence from great britain two years previously and brought the ships home to england on october more than a year after assuming command he was formally promoted to the post of captain on october in recognition of his achievements john webber who had previously painted cook took gore's portrait as the navy made him an honorary moving further in the footsteps of cook he was offered the late captain's vacant rooms at the greenwich hospital in having circumnavigated the globe four times he died on august legacy gore was survived by a son john born who was also a royal navy officer who reached the rank of

john gore senior's wife ann gore although she is known to have received a royal navy widow's pension from his son that is john gore senior's grandson graham gore continued the expeditionary heritage perishing in john franklin's attempt to navigate the northwest passage nearly years after his grandfather had attempted the same gore point and the gore peninsula in the alaskan kenai fjords were named for john gore by captain nathaniel portlock a fellow veteran of cook's third voyage who explored the pacific northwest of america in the late century there are also several australian and new zealand sites named after john gore ismail pasha warning page using template infobox officeholder with unknown parameter religion this message is shown only in preview ismail pasha was an ottoman statesman who served as the governor of damascus and amir in prior to this post he served as the agha local commander of ma'arrat and steadily moved up the ranks to become the governor of the districts of ma'arrat hama and homs in and then governor of tripoli in before being assigned to the damascus governorship his consistent promotion was attributed to his successes in restoring order to the syrian countryside after a period of high instability protecting syria's farmlands from bedouin raids and ensuring the safety of the annual hajj pilgrim caravan to mecca although he was deposed from the governorship in he established his family as a major political household in syria whose members were frequently appointed as the governors of the damascus tripoli and sidon provinces and who often served longer than typical terms early career in central syria ismail was the son of a professional ottoman soldier who settled in ma'arrat ma'arra in the century ismail was known as ibn son of and early in his career as ismail agha he is first mentioned in the history records in when as the agha local military commander of ma'arra he sent wheat and barley provisions to homs after that city faced a food shortage following an attack by bedouin raiders in he was appointed the mutasallim district governor of the ma'arra homs and hama sanjaks districts ma'arra was part of aleppo eyalet while homs and hama were part of tripoli eyalet ismail was charged with repopulating villages that had been abandoned due to bedouin raids and restoring order in the districts in late the central authorities commanded him to forcibly settle the nomadic and frequently rebellious turkmen tribesmen of the region in villages in his territory was able to bring order and peace to the districts through forming local alliances and with the support of aleppo's wali provincial governor the latter used his influence to persuade the sublime porte ottoman imperial government to send ismail imperial troops to rein in the nomadic turkmen and mawali tribes the sublime porte also granted ismail and his family certain privileges that guaranteed them significant income ismail's restoration of order amid instability marked by frequent bedouin raids infighting among various military forces and the brutality of local administrators gained him a reputation as a resolute but just and even generous ruler according to historian dick douwes the chronicler muhammad praised ismail's rule and prayed that god give him strength and make him stand firm and prolong his rule and deliver him and his troops from his enemies although his appointment was for seven years by his second year in office in ismail was promoted as wali of tripoli eyalet and was thereafter known as ismail pasha during his term he successfully protected muslim pilgrim convoys on their way to damascus from where they would begin their departure to mecca to perform the hajj ismail pasha also ensured that the towns of tripoli eyalet had sufficient food supplies and he protected the province's farmlands from harvest thieves this contrasted with the other governors of tripoli who typically neglected their duties in the homs and hama districts due to the challenge posed in those regions by frequent bedouin depredations during ismail pasha's time in office the central authorities granted him a malikâne leasehold for life over the sanjak of hama while the town of hama became the countryside headquarters of the family after they moved there from ma'arra wali of damascus ismail pasha was transferred to the governorship of damascus eyalet in after a revolt in the city against wali çerkes osman pasha he was replaced by his brother sulayman pasha in tripoli while one of his sons was appointed mutasallim of hama as wali of damascus he was tasked with bringing order to the syrian interior from ma'arra in the north to the eastern bank of the jordan river in the south he was also concurrently appointed amir and was thus responsible for the safety and provisioning of the annual hajj caravan from damascus to mecca in his first four years as amir ismail pasha successfully countered four attempted bedouin raids against the caravan throughout his term in damascus ismail pasha appointed members of his family or their close associates as the mutasallims of hama homs and ma'arra he established lucrative monopolies as governor including on sheep from hama and was responsible for a number of building works in the city of damascus ismail pasha was dismissed from the governorship in late when the sublime porte accused him of embezzling money slated for provisioning the hajj caravan however this charge was deemed dubious by historian karl barbir ismail pasha was likely dismissed due to the ousting of sultan ahmed iii in a coup and the consequent dismissal of provincial governors appointed under ahmed's administration in addition to his imprisonment in the citadel of damascus ismail pasha's properties were seized by the authorities while his brother sulayman pasha was dismissed from the tripoli governorship however in ismail pasha and sulayman pasha were pardoned ismail pasha was appointed wali of crete eyalet in and served until sulayman pasha would later succeed ismail as wali of damascus in legacy ismail pasha established the foundations of the family's prominence in syria as the most powerful political household in the provinces of damascus sidon and tripoli in the century between and the family nearly monopolized the offices of wali of damascus and amir the frequent and consecutive appointments of members to damascus contrasted with the traditionally short typically terms that most governors of damascus served the fact that the were from syria also differed from the mostly officials who traditionally filled the post of wali of damascus during those years the family was able to prevent bedouin raids against syrian villages and maintained the protection of grain harvests and the grain supply to damascus among the governors that succeeded ismail pasha was his son as'ad pasha who ruled longer than any other wali of damascus serving for consecutive years

but accomplishing the most david powel david powel was a welsh church of england clergyman and historian who published the first printed history of wales in life powel was born in denbighshire and commenced his studies at the university of oxford when he was sometime between and whilst his initial college membership is not known it is known that he moved to jesus college when it was founded in he obtained his degree on march and is thought to have been the college's first graduate he obtained his on july before powel graduated he had been named as vicar of ruabon denbighshire and rector of llanfyllin montgomeryshire he became vicar of meifod in place of his llanfyllin position in and was also the holder of two prebends at st asaph cathedral after further study he obtained degrees of b th on february and d th on april he was then private chaplain to sir henry sidney president of the council in the marches of wales from about to he died in in ruabon where he was buried one of his sons was gabriel powell also a clergyman and a strident anti catholic works powel made a significant contribution to developing and preserving welsh culture and to the growth of protestantism in wales he was a supporter of william morgan's efforts to translate the bible into welsh he kept the privy council informed about illegal books circulating amongst roman catholics in wales he was a respected scholar and was associated with geographers such as john dee and richard hakluyt in powel took over the task of preparing for publication an english translation by humphrey llwyd of some medieval welsh chronicles upon which john dee had been working before leaving england powel expanded llwyd's work in its scope and detail with the help of lord burghley providing access to some further documents making his own contributions clear by typographical distinctions the resulting publication in the historie of cambria now called wales was the first printed history of wales the work remained an important source for medieval welsh history for several centuries thereafter it also popularised the legend that prince madoc had discovered america in about a tale used to justify english encroachments on the territory of spanish america for example in hakluyt's discourse on western planting powel also published a volume with editions of ponticus virunnius's historia britannica and gerald of wales's itinerarium cambriae journey through wales and descriptio cambriae description of wales but omitted gerald's negative comments about the welsh the volume was dedicated to sidney he is also said by the later lexicographer john davies to have worked on an unpublished welsh dictionary jimmy philip jimmy philip was the very first manager of scottish football club aberdeen fc he was in charge of the club from its foundation in until his retirement in he died in a car crash in belfast in early life little is recorded about philip's early life but it is known that he was a native aberdonian that he had a wide range of sporting interests and that he had proposed to underwrite the very first overseas tour by a scottish international team he was also a referee although by profession he was a aberdeen fc manager philip was appointed manager for the first competitive game of the new club a draw with stenhousemuir on august in that first season aberdeen won the aberdeenshire cup and subsequently made a bid to be elected to the scottish league first division philip was despatched to glasgow to make the club's case and returned with the promise of enough support however the final decision of the existing league members was to elect aberdeen to the second division during that second season the qualifying cup was won at dens park in dundee a victory over renton former scottish cup holders progress in the league was not so straightforward and the club ended the season in seventh place of twelve however a proposal by celtic to expand division to clubs meant that places were available for the season and aberdeen were duly elected thereafter progress was steady rather than spectacular the club finishing in position in the next two seasons although there was a scottish cup in in which celtic prevailed at pittodrie for the next few seasons aberdeen seem to have been genuine contenders for league honours topping the table on more than one occasion but never at season's end in the season both rangers and celtic were beaten at pittodrie for the first time and another cup followed that game too was lost to celtic but the strength of the side that season led to an invitation to a close season tour of bohemia moravia and poland after the end of the season philip served as a referee at the olympic games in stockholm in april philip's position became in spite of the relative penury of the club at this time but during wartime the position reverted to the manager and players struggled on through the early years of the war the team often made up of locally billeted servicemen but by early the strain on finances and the lack of public enthusiasm was too much and the club withdrew from competition on the resumption of football in philip was offered his old post at a salary of per annum a move which caused some controversy among the directors at the time philip accepted and prepared to take the club forward into the new decade the early proved no more fruitful for philip and his team than the prewar era but one record was set which still stands as of aberdeen's record victory of over peterhead in there were two further unsuccessful cup in and but philip's reign came to an end with no senior silverware to show for it final years philip retired as aberdeen manager at the end of the season becoming a director and was also involved with the clan macgregor he died in a road traffic accident in belfast in managerial honours aberdeen aberdeenshire cup scottish qualifying cup managerial statistics as of december tirzah

rebelled population of belgrade pashalik last years yeğen osman by then a pasha then attempted to become grand vizier although yeğen osman's ambition angered the other ottoman statesmen they were reluctant to make an operation against yeğen osman for they were afraid of the exaggerated power of osman however in a war council in edirne selim i giray the crimean khan and a vassal of the ottoman empire called the ottoman porte to execute osman when this happened the incumbent grand vizier outlawed the sekban corps threatening soldiers who proved unwilling to disperse with execution and a civil war ensued the sekbans gained the upper hand but a further of the ottoman central administration saw yeğen osman be captured and executed this did not end the sekban's rebellions and while in

john gunning for the american businessman and politician see john w gunning john gunning was an english surgeon he married in dorothy sister of richard warren physician to the king early career gunning was born at swainswick and educated at winchester he was the assistant surgeon to st george's hospital london from january to january and full surgeon from that date till his death in he was elected steward of anatomy by the surgeons company but paid a fine rather than serve in he was elected examiner on the death of percivall pott and in the same year he was chosen master of the company and signalised his year of office by a firm effort to reform its administration and reorganise its work his attack upon the expensive system of dinners of the courts of assistants and of examiners and his philippic on retiring from office on july as recorded by south show that he could be fearlessly outspoken your theatre he says in his last address is without lectures your without books is converted into an office for your clerk and your is become his if gentlemen you make no better use of the hall than what you have already done you had better sell it and apply the money for the good of the company in some other way the court of assistants appointed a committee to consider the question and numerous reforms were effected in gunning was appointed the first professor of surgery but he soon resigned on the plea that it occupied too much of his time and no new appointment was made gunning had been appointed of the army in on the death of john hunter he was also senior surgeon extraordinary to the king conflict with john hunter gunning was in general opposed to his colleague at st george's john hunter who was frequently overbearing to his professional brethren and appeared to them to neglect the proper business of a surgeon for unpractical pursuits the quarrel rose to a great pitch when a surgeon was elected in succession to charles hawkins who had resigned thomas keate was supported by gunning and everard home by hunter and after a sharp contest keate was elected a dispute ensued about fees for surgical lectures which led to a controversy between gunning senior surgeon supported by two of his colleagues and hunter see the account in drewry ottley life of john hunter pp it ended in john hunter's dramatically sudden death on oct immediately after being flatly contradicted by one of his colleagues apparently gunning the sale of surgeon's hall in it was determined to sell the surgeons hall on account of the expense attending its repair but on july gunning on behalf of the committee reported that as no one had bid within of the price set upon it it had been bought in at the same court henry cline was elected a member of the court of assistants in the absence of a governor one having just died and the other being blind and paralysed in warwickshire this voided the charter a bill brought into parliament in to indemnify the company and to give it greater power over the profession after passing the commons was lost in the house of lords by the influence of thurlow owing it is said to a grudge against gunning thurlow having said there's no more science in surgery than in butchery a remark apparently prompted by his brother's death while undergoing treatment by hunter gunning had retorted then my lord i heartily pray that your lordship may break your leg and have only a butcher to set it gunning died at bath on feb leaving five children anna ekelöf anna eleonora ekelöf fl was a swedish serial impostor she committed fraud with a series of false identities posing as mamsell noblewoman officer count and the crown prince of sweden before her arrest in first fraud in june anna ekelöf was arrested dressed in male clothing in värmland near the border being put on trial for investigation she was revealed to have committed a serial of identity frauds witnesses testified that she was first encountered in the border area dressed as a mamsell claiming to be on the run to marry her beloved who was not approved by her parents after this she dressed herself as a nobleman with a white wig and introduced herself as count carl ekeblad who had been forced to escape sweden dressed as a woman after having been exiled from stockholm due to an incident and who was awaiting the king's forgiveness to return as count ekeblad she had recruited a retinue of swedes and norwegians among them the runaway swedish farmer olof persson the runaway swedish baker schutlz who acted as servants as well as the wife of police officer istmin emerentia schröder to dance and ammuse himself with she was housed at the löfsnäs manor in norway belong to the sister of emerentia during her time as count ekelöf lived a debauched life with drinking foul language foolhardily riding and a never ending use of tobacco and was also known to threaten and struck people who opposed her she defended herself by saying that she had only acted in such a way to be trustworthy in her role as a man second fraud at the customary office of magnebro she then had rumors spread which let it be known that she was in fact the swedish crown prince in disguise who in a conflict with riksråd count carl gustaf tessin and the nobility party of the parliament had come to prepare a coup d'etat to depose the government this was in fact not an unlikely rumor as there was at the time many serious rumors circulating about planned uprisings against the government since the coup of by queen louisa ulrika the actual crown prince was in the same age and with the same fragile built as ekelöf and anna ekelöf was furthermore equipped with a vast and up to date knowledge about the current political situation when rumors reached the authorities in oslo that someone alleged to be the swedish heir to the throne was present at the border ekelöf was taken captive and brought to oslo where her identity as a woman was discovered she was apparently allowed to return to the border but was soon after arrested by the swedish authorities who subjected her to a physical examination to establish her gender trial anna ekelöf admitted posing as a count but denied to have ever posed as the heir to the throne and if so only under the intoxication of alcohol she stated that she was the daughter of a diseased sea captain in gothenburg and that she had run away from home to elope and meet her beloved sergeant magnus sandberg in norway where they could marry without the approval of his disapproving parents she had not intended to pose as a man she had merely put the clothes on after having been provided them by a runaway swedish baker on the way because her own clothes had been damaged during the trip and the nobleman clothes was nearer to her social class as a mamsell the whole posing as a count was merely an innocent play while she awaited to be united with her beloved the authorities furthermore suspected her to have eloped over the border with the purpose of performing an abortion and suggested that her relationship with magnus sandberg was in fact incestuous during the trial it was discovered that she on several previous occasions had left a trace of false identities she had on various occasions posed as a runaway girl fleeing from an arranged marriage to marry her true love the story of a girl eloping for love dressed as a man was a popular motive in contemporary novels a story she apparently used often in past deceptions the only testimony that may give a suggestion to her real identity was a testimony given a previous trial in which she had been imprisoned at halmstad castle at that occasion care taker emanuel bergman from borås pointed her out to be the same person as a certain passannicka pass who had previously been subjected to physical punishment for crimes committed in borås and exiled from that city aftermath the true identity of anna ekelöf was never established as she managed to escape custody and was never caught again on her way to court to hear her verdict the prison carriage broke down and the party was forced to spend the night on the farm of the peasant nils amundsson she managed to convince him that she was indeed the crown prince in disguise and that he would be richly rewarded if he assisted her escape the night of june amundsson knocked on her window and she climbed out and mounted a horse he provided her rode of toward the norwegian border and was never seen again amundsson claimed that he had been so intoxicated by her talk that he had become prepared to sacrifice his life and property for her anna ekelöf was not the only female criminal posing as a man in early modern sweden kerstin pedersdotter ran away from her abusive husband dressed as a man under the name christopher and took refuge with her stepbrother with whom she made a theft tour through the countryside and was similar to ekelöf accused of having dressed as a man to hide an incestuous relationship gunilla

bishop's authority almost immediately there is no proof that he had received consecration until he is clearly represented as in a document dating to july the earl's purpose in pushing his young kinsman into the bishopric was made clear by the new bishop's following actions bishop alasdair proceeded to alienate most of the bishopric's lands and revenues giving the lion's share to the earl according to the historian robert keith bishop alasdair retained for his successors scarce so much as would be a moderate competency for a minister in brechin travels in may alasdair caimbeul received

charges against him the outcome of these charges is however not known as the records do not survive in the following two decades though caimbeul can be seen to take an active part in establishment politics attending many assemblies parliaments and meetings of the privy council often acting as a supporter of argyll notably the privy council which met at brechin in april denounced him as a

jahangir became increasingly addicted to opium and alcohol asmat begum who was a wise and patient counsel in her own right must certainly have been the nurturing hub of the junta in its heyday she is

marwah portrayed asmat begum in epic channel's critically acclaimed historical drama siyaasat based on the twentieth wife pierre passereau pierre passereau fl was a french composer of the renaissance along with clément janequin he was one of the most popular composers of parisian chansons in france in the his output consisted almost exclusively of chansons most of them were published by printer pierre attaingnant most of them were rustic in character similar to patter songs using onomatopoeia double entendres and frequent obscenity a common feature of popular music in france and the low countries in the life some details of passereau's life have been compiled by scholars including pioneering musicologist fétis in his enormous biographie universelle des musiciens passereau first appears in the historical record as a tenor singer in the chapel of the count of angoulême who was later to become king francis i therefore he was already an adult and born before about he had some association with both bourges cathedral and cambrai cathedral as he appears in the records of both places and is documented as being a singer at cambrai between and he may also have been a priest at the church of saint in paris although this statement by fétis has not been independently confirmed music and influence almost everything passereau wrote or everything that has survived are chansons since details of his biography are spotty it is difficult to determine how much lost work there may be he is known to have written one sacred composition a motet unde veniet auxilium michi the text is from psalm and used in the office of the dead passereau's chansons are mostly affairs similar in content to the italian frottola although no direct influence from the earlier popular italian form has been reliably demonstrated he liked to use nonsense syllables often in imitation of animals as in il est bel et bon his most popular piece which imitates the clucking of chickens this composition was sung as far away as venice while passereau may have gotten the idea from janequin who was writing onomatopoeic chansons as early as il est bel et bon was published in its popularity rivaled that of the music of janequin and printer pierre attaingnant devoted a book entirely to the music of the two composers in it is possible that francis i who knew passereau from his service at the french court recommended the composer to the printer additional features of passereau's chansons include the use of quick declamation chordal passages with occasional polyphony generally syllabic word setting satirical and ribald subjects and catchy rhythms an additional indication of passereau's popularity is his inclusion by françois rabelais as one of a list of popular musicians in gargantua and pantagruel richard coppin richard coppin was a english political and religious writer and prolific radical pamphleteer and preacher late to late he was an anglican clergyman until or possibly a lay preacher from berkshire with little formal education he is known as an associate of abiezer coppe who wrote an introduction to coppin's divine teachings christopher hill considers that coppe took most of his theology from coppin after the suppression of episcopacy october he had attached himself for a short time to the presbyterians in london he afterwards was an independent based on an inward experience in he was not to exercise a settled ministry he began to preach in berkshire he was constantly in trouble well documented in pamphlets arising from the blasphemy act the authorities treated him leniently in the period to he first got into serious trouble by preaching on four successive days in the parish church of evenlode worcestershire he had been invited by parishioners with the consent of the rector ralph nevil nevil however brought neighbouring clergy to discuss matters with coppin in the church and eventually got a warrant against him for blasphemy coppin was tried before chief baron john wilde at the worcester assizes on march the jury found him guilty of denying heaven and hell but wilde reproved them for their verdict and bound over coppin to appear for judgment at the next assize by that time his accusers had fresh evidence relating to coppin's proceedings at enstone oxfordshire whereupon judge nicholes bound him to appear at the next oxford assize a debate he had at burford oxfordshire in was recorded by his counterpart on the side of orthodoxy john osborne vicar of bampton osborne was a presbyterian east vicar at bampton from to on march he was tried at oxford before serjeant green the jury at first disagreed but eventually found him guilty green bound him over to the next assize when judge hutton gave him his discharge preaching at gloucestershire on march coppin was again apprehended and brought for trial at gloucester on informations before serjeant glyn on july glyn would not receive the informations and so the matter ended about joseph salmon minister in kent had set up a course of sunday preaching in rochester cathedral salmon was an allegorist and is said to have sowed the seeds of ranting familism in midsummer salmon went abroad and his followers brought coppin from london to fill his place it is probable that his acquaintance with abiezer coppe introduced him to the sectaries of rochester at the end of september or beginning of october walter rosewell incumbent of chatham went to hear coppin preach and gained the impression that he affirmed the peccability of christ and denied the resurrection of the flesh rosewell with other presbyterians agreed to conduct a tuesday lecture in the cathedral to counteract coppin's heresies a public discussion was held in the cathedral from to december between coppin and rosewell assisted by daniel french minister of stroud the mayor presiding before it ended gaman an anabaptist put himself forward to oppose both parties on saturday night december coppin was served with a warrant forbidding him to preach next day and requiring his attendance before the magistrates on monday he preached not in the cathedral where a guard of soldiers was set but in the and in the fields he was imprisoned on december as a ranter a term which is now contested in historiography thomas kelsey one of cromwell's then based at dover took a harder line with coppin than previously imposing six months in jail he defended himself writing from maidstone prison a pamphlet a blow at the serpent another account was that of walter rosewell pushed out as vicar at chatham kent in in the serpents subtilty discovered before june he had been set free by habeas corpus coppin's work provoked edward garland vicar at hartclip hartlip kent to reply in kind in accusing coppin of heresies the pamphlet

ottoman governor of egypt for the ottoman grand vizier see kara mustafa pasha for the ottoman grand vizier see kemankeş kara mustafa pasha kara mustafa pasha died was an ottoman statesman who served twice as the ottoman governor of egypt firstly from july to october and secondly from february to may he also served earlier as the agha chief of the janissary corps in mustafa pasha was educated in the enderun palace school he married fatma sultan a daughter of sultan ahmed i in but was executed that same year by the reigning sultan and his new murad iv first term after taking office as governor of egypt for the first time he accused his predecessor silahdar ibrahim pasha of failing to pay the customary contribution of every governor of egypt to the treasury he sent his kaymakam lieutenant salih bey after ibrahim pasha who told salih bey that whatever money he owed he would give directly to the sultan in istanbul where he was headed anyway however the deposition of the sultan mustafa i and the succession of murad iv to the throne as well as the political chaos around the event that occurred before ibrahim pasha arrived back in constantinople allowed him to keep the money controversy over replacement when the sultan replaced mustafa pasha with çeşteci ali pasha after only five months in office as the custom of the sultans was to change the governors of egypt in rapid succession the local ottoman troops marched to the new kaymakam's house and demanded the bonus salaries they usually received when the governor was replaced the new kaymakam delayed them until the next day and at the same time asked them to bring mustafa pasha to him as the kaymakam's initial task was to analyze the affairs of mustafa pasha one of the paintings belonging to the seraglio was lost and it was suspected that mustafa pasha had taken it for himself however the army refused this request telling him we cannot seize the person of the vizier nor make any inquiry after his effects let them appoint for guards and let them conduct him to alexandria if çeşteci ali pasha is already arrived in that city they will put him into his hands if they do not find him there let them conduct him to constantinople the entire army then reportedly swore on the quran to be resolute in their will the next day october the armies and the had mustafa pasha read the sultan's orders for his replacement and audit when the army members again demanded compensation from the new kaymakam and deputy governor they reproached the soldiers by saying that they constantly demanded the same thing every three months to which the soldiers replied why then does the sultan our master change the beylerbeys governors of the province every three months to the great injury of the inhabitants if he chooses to nominate every day new beylerbeys we shall also demand every day new contributions when the deputy governor replied that he could not compensate the soldiers until the new governor arrived in cairo the soldiers grew enraged and nearly killed him and the kaymakam before they escaped the soldiers then declared we will have no other governor than mustafa let ali return to the place from whence he came as the soldiers welcomed mustafa pasha back as governor he privately wrote to the sultan to ask for a confirmation of his of the office with many local figures also writing to the sultan on his behalf when the soldiers were informed that the replacement governor çeşteci ali pasha had landed in alexandria they sent messengers to inform him of what had occurred ali pasha angry at the news proceeded to put one of the messengers in chains but the troops in the area loyal to mustafa pasha released the messenger destroyed ali pasha's camp and forced him to reembark on his ship when a wind accidentally brought his ship back to the port mustafa pasha had his troops fire cannonballs at the ship because of unfavorable wind conditions ali pasha was forced to spend the winter in another port before heading back to constantinople no news arrived from the capital confirming or denying whether mustafa pasha was the rightful governor and the populace began to grow uneasy finally on february a carrier pigeon arrived with a letter from the sultan in constantinople confirming the reinstatement and soon afterwards the chief footman of the sultan arrived to deliver mustafa pasha's governor's caftan second term in the first year of mustafa pasha's second term as governor of egypt the nile flooded to level but the waters receded in time for sowing and a successful harvest followed mustafa pasha reportedly confiscated the inheritances of a large number of wealthy egyptians for himself growing wealthy from the practice when heirs existed he would reportedly fake their seal and claim their money furthermore the province of egypt experienced a plague from november to june which although largely restricted to affecting those over years old nevertheless reportedly killed approximately people to mollify and hasten the grieving process and possibly to avoid further contagion from corpses mustafa pasha banned all funerals and the bodies were carried through the streets and buried without ceremony mustafa pasha was dismissed from the office of governor for the second and final time on may later life after leaving office mustafa pasha was hounded by his successor bayram pasha who demanded of him a large restitution reported as sandıks after auditing the treasury in a way similar to what mustafa pasha himself had done to his own predecessor silahdar ibrahim pasha mustafa pasha acting as though he could not pay the amount despite the wealth he had apparently amassed while in office sold his belongings to further his ruse however bayram pasha did not let up until mustafa pasha paid the entire sum in mustafa pasha married fatma sultan a daughter of the late sultan ahmed i but that same year he was executed by the reigning sultan murad iv and his

the natural philosophy of bernardino telesio giambattista della porta and members of the accademia dei lincei family background and career quinzio bongiovanni was the son of giovan nicola a doctor and lamberta fazzari the family had probably originally come from maida which it left to escape the feudal domination of the house of caracciolo and moved into the palazzo bongiovanni home to the vianeo brothers pioneering surgeons who were also from maida quinzio finished his studies in medicine and philosophy under giovan bernardino longo and giovan girolamo polverino in naples in he published the work for which he is principally remembered peripateticarum disputationum de principiis naturae venice dedicated to cardinal carafa he was a member accademia degli affaticati academy of the weary in his home town of tropea some time before he was appointed protomedico chief physician to the king philip ii of spain a position which required him to licence and regulate all healers surgeons midwives and alchemists in the kingdom he insisted that apothecaries be prevented from preparing herbal remedies before being properly inspected otherwise they make the compositions up in their own way without fear of god or justice and to the detriment of human bodies which for this reason are daily made to suffer he apparently also worked for a time for the prince of bisignano he returned to naples in and was appointed reader in philosophy and medicine at the university he later became professor of medicine and archiater to popes pius v and gregory xiii among his most distinguished pupils were marco aurelio severino and giovanni battista cavallari in the german medic giovanni custode reported to his colleague giovanni faber the opinion of bongiovanni that in rome doctors are princes but in naples they are paupers and working very hard to earn anything opinions on natural philosophy one story about buongiovanni suggests that he was firmly in the aristotelian camp in the discussions about nature sensation and the order of the universe in telesio was debating with his student antonio persio the nature of light and whether or not the sun was hot buongiovanni joined the discussion arguing it could not be hot because it was beyond the moon and therefore in traditional aristotelian cosmology beyond the realm of the senses telesio argued that the sun's rays both illuminate and heat the earth when the argument could not be resolved telesio took him out into the street in the midday sun and stood with him can't you feel it he asked but buongiovanni refused to accept this evidence death and legacy bongiovanni died in naples on june bequeathing part of his estate to the two sons of his brother flaminio giovancola and quinzio junior he also left provision for the jesuit colleges in naples massa lubrense and tropea scudi for the education of twelve poor boys of his home town with the jesuits scudi to provide dowries for widows and orphans of the same town to marry and scudi for the

his grandfather's death in her husband inherited craigie took the surname wallace and assumed the style of a baronet however the property was deeply indebted and in he was obliged to sell all that remained of craigie it would seem to have been shortly after this that eglantine obtained a legal separation on the ground it is said of her husband's cruelty it is probable that the quarrel was due to pecuniary embarrassment a little later lady wallace was herself summoned for assaulting a woman apparently a humble companion and was directed by the magistrate to compound the matter leaving

several autobiographical notes in the conduct of the king of prussia and general dumouriez fateh shah fateh shah was the king of garhwal a small kingdom in north india from to campaigns h g walton states that fateh shah led an attack from dehradun on saharanpur in the attack was repelled by sayyed ali the mughal imperial general according to research by williams fateh shah established a township called fateh pur in haraura pargana of saharanpur according to rahul sankrityayan and fateh prakash raja fateh shah also invaded tibet where his sword and armour were preserved in the monastery at daba for a long time battle of bhangani main article battle of bhangani dabral and bhakt darshan believe that fateh shah invaded sirmur in ajay singh rawat writes that the year of invasion mentioned by these writers is not correct and the animosity between fateh shah and raja of sirmur is the prelude to the battle of bhangani mat prakash or medni prakash the raja of sirmur sought the help of guru gobind singh to reconcile his differences with fateh shah the guru persuaded fateh shah to restore good relations with the raja of sirmur and to return the seized portion of the sirmur kingdom in the marriage of fateh shah's daughter was arranged with the son of raja bhim chand of bilaspur kahlur guru gobind singh had sent jewellery worth one lakh rupees to fateh shah's daughter at the time of marriage ceremony however bhim chand had grown wary of the rising influence of guru gobind singh and had developed animosity toward the guru he threatened to cancel the marriage if fateh shah accepted the gift from the guru later the combined forces of bhim chand and fateh shah launched an attack on guru gobind singh's camp guru gobind singh was already prepared for a battle and the two forces met at bhangani located about six miles from paonta on september dr fauja singh believes that the battle of bhangani should not be connected with the story of fateh shah's refusal of the wedding presents sent by the guru the author of bichitra natak doesn't mention the name of raja bhim chand and states that fateh shah fought with him for no obvious reasons according to ajay singh rawat one of the possible grievances of fateh shah could have been the presence of guru's armed camp near his territory paonta was a strategic location on the only convenient route connecting nahan capital of sirmur and garhwal he also believes that it is likely that the subjects of garhwal suffered from lawless activities of some of the guru's followers these reasons could have led him to ally with bhim chand to attack the guru according to the author of bichitra natak and majority of historians the battle resulted in the victory of the author's the guru's forces and the enemy forces fled from the battlefield however authors such as pandit harikrishna raturi anil chandra banerjee and a s rawat believe that the battle ended without any consequences since the guru's victory is not substantiated by any territorial annexations and the guru entered into an understanding with bhim chand soon after the battle although there is practically no evidence about the territorial ambitions of the guru battles with kumaon fateh shah also fought several battles against kumaon without any conclusive results gyan chand of kumaon who ascended the throne in raided pindar valley in garhwal after he was crowned in he crossed ramganga river and plundered sabli khatli and sainchar fateh shah replied by invading chaukot and giwar areas of kumaon in in the kumaonis defeated the garhwalis in the battle of duduli near melchauri in garhwal in the kumaon forces annexed juniyagarh in bichla chaukot and razed the old fort at chandpur raja jagat chand of kumaon plundered lohba and garrisoned the fort of lohbagarh next year he proceeded as far as srinagar in garhwal according to h g walton raja of kumaon occupied srinagar and fateh shah fled to dehradun fateh shah appears to have returned very soon to garhwal in he mobilized his troops in badhan patronage to art and literature the contemporary writings mention garhwal as a very prosperous state during fateh shah's reign fateh shah was a great patron of art and literature like vikramaditya and akbar he is said to have nine illustrious figures navaratnas in his court sureshanand barthwal revatram dhasmana rudridutt kimothi hari dutt nautiyal vasvanand bahuguna shashidhar dangwal sahdev chandola kirit ram khanthola and hari dutt thapliyal some of the encomiastic works from ratan shah's period include fateh shah karna granth by jatadhar or jatashankar fateh prakash by ratan kavi or kshem ram vrit vichar by kavi raj sukhdev misra vrit kaumudi or chhandsar pingal by mati ram ratan kavi's eulogies state that there was perfect law and order in garhwal during fateh shah's reign and people did not lock their houses as a result kavi raj sukhdev misra praises the raja's gallantry mati ram's vrit kaumudi compares the raja's generosity with that of the maratha king shivaji ananda coomaraswamy mentions that two painters from the mughal court shyam dass and har dass accompanied suleiman shikoh to garhwal it is possible that these painters got patronage during the reign of fateh shah which resulted in the birth of the garhwali school of painting family fateh shah had five children upendra shah became

arms issued to king álvaro i in álvaro i nimi a lukeni lua mvemba was a manikongo mwene kongo or king of kongo from to biography father was an unknown kongo nobleman who died leaving his mother to remarry to king henrique i when henrique i died fighting on the eastern frontier he had left álvaro as his regent according to duarte lopes kongo's ambassador to rome in álvaro had taken up the kingship by common consent however there do appear to have been others who wished to be king and some scholars notably francois bontinck think that rule was seen as an usurpation the invasion of the jagas which took place shortly after álvaro became king is sometimes seen as a protest against this usurpation other scholars however doubt the connection between the jaga invasion and a dynastic crisis the jagas however did create a major problem for álvaro who had to abandon the capital of mbanza kongo and flee to an island in the congo river from that place he sought help from portugal to restore him to the throne and expel the jagas portugal responded by sending an expedition of soldiers mostly from the colony of são tome under the command of francisco de gouveia sottomaior gouveia sottomaior's instructions included obtaining some sort of vassalage from álvaro and regaining control of the portuguese community in kongo by building a fort to protect them however that might be strong opposition by portuguese in kongo led by confessor francisco barbuda prevented most of gouveia sottomaior's instructions from being carried out however álvaro apparently did permit the portuguese to settle in luanda and the colony of angola was born when paulo dias de novais arrived with his force in álvaro sought to relieve the potential threat to his sovereignty by assisting dias de novais sending troops to help him in however he or at the very least francisco barbuda was instrumental in persuading the king of ndongo where dias de novais had his principal forces to drive the portuguese out once this had happened however álvaro sent an army to angola to assist the portuguese and to conquer ndongo the conquest failed however as the kongo army was overextended and could not cross the bengo river successfully álvaro sought to europeanize kongo more fully than had been the case before he was the first king to refer to the capital city as são salvador he also sought to obtain a bishop from rome though it was not until the reign of his son álvaro ii of kongo that this was accomplished in he was succeeded by his son álvaro ii thomas tresham died for other people with the same name see thomas tresham disambiguation sir thomas tresham september was a prominent recusant catholic landowner in elizabethan northamptonshire he died two years after the accession of james vi and i life tresham was brought up in the throckmorton household he inherited large estates at the age of from his grandfather and namesake thomas tresham i establishing him as a member of the catholic elite he was widely regarded as clever and a correspondent of william cecil the secretary of state to queen elizabeth and sir christopher hatton the lord chancellor tresham dedicated much of his life to collecting books he was much disliked however for an enclosure policy towards common land following a riot which destroyed some of his hedges he had people executed tresham was picked as sheriff for northamptonshire in and was knighted at the queen's royal progress at kenilworth in he frequently entertained large numbers of friends and acquaintances and pursued an aggressively reforming estate policy his recusancy jesuit connections and arguments for the state's lack of jurisdiction in matters of conscience made him the subject of official attention and he was imprisoned several times and fined heavily at a time when queen elizabeth was anxious about the catholic threat posed by spain and by her cousin mary queen of scots catholics were made targets for persecution by their spiritual loyalty to another temporal power the pope and by extension the catholic king of spain between and tresham paid penalties totalling just under equivalent to in these heavy financial demands were in reality overshadowed by the expense of his building projects and his insistence on making advantageous marriages for his six daughters bringing with them sizeable dowries his credit was thus impaired and the involvement of his son francis in the earl of essex's rebellion cost him over as a catholic who had jesuit links and who argued for an individual's right to act according to his conscience unmolested he was tarred with the brush of disloyalty a mark he fiercely rejected ultimately his son lewis successfully ate through what little family money was left he left three notable buildings in northamptonshire the extraordinary rushton triangular lodge and the unfinished lyveden new bield both of which embody the strength of his faith the triangular lodge bears witness to tresham's fidelity to the doctrine of the trinity there was also a more personal connection above the door we find the inscription tres testimonium dant the three bear witness or perhaps tres bears witness tres may be a moment of it was his wife's pet name for him tresham himself was the architect of these designs and the extant family papers in the british library reveal some of his plans his sense of civic responsibility in local society occasioned by his gentility and the expectations of his rank and family practice led him to begin building the market house at rothwell in thought to be a sessions house and decorated with the arms of other local families sir thomas was a considerable landowner at his death in but his estate had of debt equivalent to in marriage and children in he married muriel a daughter of sir robert throckmorton and elizabeth hussey the throckmorton family was a wealthy catholic family from coughton court in warwickshire and tresham had been sir robert's ward thomas and muriel had eleven children including francis d december mary d october married thomas brudenell earl of cardigan elizabeth married william parker baron monteagle frances married edward stourton baron stourton catherine married sir john webbe baron of odstock his elder son francis inherited the titles estate and debt and became embroiled in the gunpowder plot later that year along with his cousins robert catesby and thomas wintour imprisoned for his actions francis met an early death in december avoiding certain execution nevertheless he was decapitated after his death and his head displayed as that of a notorious traitor his role in the plot has been the subject of debate by historians and it has been largely accepted that he was the author of the famous mounteagle letter however widely agreed his authorship of the letter to his relative it remains conjectural archibald douglas parson of douglas archibald douglas parson of douglas b before d after was also parson of glasgow a senator of the college of justice ambassador to queen elizabeth i of england and a notorious intriguer as a clergyman and master of arts he was known as mr archibald douglas throughout his career he was parson of douglas lanarkshire prior to january when he was awarded the income of the third of the benefices for that parish he was appointed to the college of justice on november as an extraordinary lord in place of adam bothwell bishop of orkney accused with his brother william douglas of whittingehame of involvement in the conspiracy to murder david riccio he was obliged to retire to france for some time but the husband of mary queen of scots henry stuart lord darnley secured his return to scotland where douglas then successfully negotiated the pardons of the other conspirators gazetted on december he then entered into the intrigues of james hepburn earl of bothwell for the assassination of darnley and acted as the agent between them and the earl of morton according to the confession of his servant thomas binning he was actually present at kirk o field on the night of the murder february in the confusion of the hour douglas lost his shoes which he had removed which were found in the morning and known to be his no pursuit was however at that time instituted against him later morton said that archibald and his brother robert had helped find the casket letters when george dalgleish was threatened with torture he asked to speak to archibald and showed robert where he had hidden the letters on june he was raised to a lord ordinary in the college of justice in place of john leslie bishop of ross archibald was often sent as a messenger to england he caused concern in january at allerton when he let slip that he already knew that mary was going to be transferred from bolton castle to tutbury castle which meant to be secret in september regent lennox sent him to the earl of sussex governor of berwick upon tweed to congratulate him on his victory over the border friends of mary queen of scots and to negotiate support for the regent's authority shortly afterwards he obtained the parsonage of glasgow but with some difficulty as the kirk at first felt him to be unqualified in january however the requisite sanction was obtained and he received the thirds of benefices for newlands glasgow thereafter in april he was arrested following the discovery that he was assisting the party of mary queen of scots and sir william kirkcaldy of grange who held edinburgh castle by bringing money sent from the duke of alba from the spanish netherlands he was at the same time accused of conspiring for the death of the earl of morton the marshall of berwick and diplomat sir william drury regretted his arrest because he had plotted with douglas to kidnap george lord seton who was negotiating for mary with the duke of alba and their plan did not take effect he was warded held under house arrest at stirling castle another source says loch leven castle he appears to have lived if not in prison at least in privacy during the regency of morton but was on november restored to his former place on the bench following a request letter from king james vi to that effect on december however he was denounced to the privy council of scotland as guilty of darnley's murder and orders were given for his arrest but having been forewarned by his kinsman george douglas of longniddry he fled from his wife's at morham to england queen elizabeth first agreed to have him returned upon the guarantee of unsuspect judges and other persons on the assise but this guarantee could not be given so he remained for the time being in england on november he was forfeited by act of parliament for the murder of lord darnley which they argued was proved by his flight to england and the evidence of his servant thomas binning who had in june already been executed for the same crime owing to the influence of his friend the master of gray he returned on a to scotland arriving in edinburgh on april his nominal trial took place on may reported at length in pitcairn's criminal trials he was acquitted there was great uproar to make matters worse he was then appointed by james vi his personal ambassador to elizabeth a post he took up in september while in that post it is said that he assisted the master of gray william keith and sir robert melville of murdocairny to move elizabeth towards clemency for mary queen of scots although dalrymple disputes this he was at length dismissed from this post being succeeded by sir robert melville after this nothing much appears to be known of him it is possible he may have died however a mr archibald douglas archdeacon of glasgow in that post prior to november is mentioned in the privy council registers on october and again on december but it is not known if this is the same person archibald douglas married about as her third husband jane d before august daughter of patrick hepburn earl of bothwell

that time the ǃkharakhoen were one of the nama clans allied to the orlam afrikaners at windhoek when this alliance was defeated by merchant andersson's private army in the battle of otjimbingwe on june piet koper was killed and simon kooper ascended to chieftaincy kooper was looking for a place for his clan to settle permanently only in could a missionary be found to stay with them the fransman

unsuccessful resistance attempt towards german colonialism in africa kooper was forced to sign a protection treaty with the german empire represented by governor theodor leutwein this treaty was in effect until the herero and nama war of began in which kooper sided with witbooi again the germans defeated the nama in the battle of swartfontein on january and forced them to flee first into the kalahari desert and then to recede into bechuanaland the british colony that later became botswana from there they repeatedly and for several years mounted guerrilla style attacks at the colony's schutztruppe protection force actions that made kooper raise to fame after witooi's death end of october kooper and jakob morenga took over the leadership of the nama uprising when morenga was captured by the british in kooper alone led the nama activities against the germans he was imprisoned at shark island near lüderitz in but escaped into the karas mountains where morenga had used the old nama fortress ǁkhauxaǃnas as hideout for his rebels kooper was the last nama leader still to fight against the germans until and the only one never to be captured again after his escape from shark

longueval fl was a french singer and composer of the renaissance a contemporary of josquin des prez he was singing master of the french royal chapel under king francis i and was important in the history of the polyphonic setting of the passion life little is known about his early life not even his approximate birthdate but he was probably from the village of longueval in the somme region of picardy scene of much heavy fighting during the somme battles in by court records indicate that he was employed by anne of brittany and between and he was a singer at the savoy court where his high pay indicates the respect he was accorded as a musician from there he went to ferrara where he was a singer between december and september therefore he was there at the same time as josquin des prez it is presumed that he wrote his most famous composition the passion setting passio domini nostri for holy week of the same event for which josquin's famous miserere was likely written why he left ferrara is not known but he may have fled an outbreak of the plague as did josquin and a large proportion of the town's population in he is listed as a member of the group of private musicians of the french king louis xii and in francis i promoted him to maître de chapelle singing master of the royal chapel that same year he went to italy with the french king along with composer jean mouton where pope leo x made both composers apostolic notaries on returning to france longueval was further honored by being made a canon of notre dame de paris a position he resigned in in order to become abbot of the benedictine priory in longueval the probable town of his birth alfonso i the duke of ferrara made one more attempt to get him to return to his opulent musical establishment in italy but evidently was not successful the last mention of longueval is at the french court in and it is presumed he may have died shortly after his colleague at the chapelle royale pierre moulu pays tribute to longueval in his musicians motet mater floreat from a manuscript presented to lorenzo ii de medici at his wedding in which after paying tribute to the leading composers of europe from du fay regis busnois basiron alexander agricola jacob obrecht and josquin turns to louis xii's own composers giving first and longest place to longueval works longueval's surviving attributed works consist of two motets two chansons and attribution of the famous passion setting passio domini nostri jesu christi for four voices he wrote at least one mass setting which was documented as being sent to ferrara but it either has not survived or has survived anonymously passio domini nostri is unusual for being a polyphonic setting of much of the passion text from the gospel of st matthew and the other three gospels especially that of st john with variation in texture rhythmic character scoring and other musical attributes depending on the speaker and the context it was enormously influential on lutheran musicians in germany throughout the century and was much imitated the passion was recorded under the direction of roger blanchard and pierre poulteau in finnish ensemble kuninkaantien muusikot musicians of the king's road has performed the passion as a part of its early passions cycle the performance took place in turku cathedral in the year of the anniversary of the reformation the chansons by longueval show both archaic characteristics in that they partially abide by the century convention of the formes fixes but they also are progressive in their use of imitation which may be an influence of josquin gary winnick game developer gary winnick is an american computer game designer writer artist and animator who was the first artist hired by lucasfilm games he maniac mansion

september was an ottoman statesman who served shortly as the governor of egypt in before he was murdered by mutinying sepahi soldiers of the ottoman army he also served as defterdar finance minister of the ottoman empire four times background ibrahim pasha appears to have lived in konya in his early life and been a dervish and a follower of the ascetic muslim mystic rumi as such he was sometimes known by the epithet sufi by historians he was also a kadı judge at some point in his life prior to becoming the defterdar of the empire and governor of egypt tenure as the governor of egypt in sultan ahmed i appointed ibrahim pasha as the governor of egypt egypt then being the seat of the egypt eyalet of the ottoman empire his office's title was beylerbey while governors of a province in general was referred to as a wāli since the ottoman conquest of egypt and their subjugation in mamluks in egypt had been silently pushing for more influence in egypt they often attempted this by trying to influence the garrisoned ottoman soldiers over the ottoman governor after ibrahim pasha was appointed governor in he began to enforce more stringent rules for the soldiers especially those from the sipahi corps an elite cavalry corps of the ottoman army putting some of them to death allegedly ibrahim pasha had one such soldier from the fellah class of the local mamluk populace put to death by hanging and had his body draped in a sirwal arabic baggy trousers which was something both the local sepahis and the mamluks wore in order to send a message of his distaste for both groups furthermore the body was then allegedly placed in a jar to symbolize the slave class the two groups belonged to another source states that tensions rose when ibrahim pasha refused to pay a briberous accession tax to the local sepahis for coming into the office of the governor of egypt sipahis in further corruption an illegal tax known as the tulba on the people of the egyptian countryside claiming that the tax was for facilitating police duties when ibrahim pasha cracked down on this practice and refused to buy into the system tensions between ibrahim pasha the sipahis the mamluks and the general army grew to enormous levels murder tensions came to a head on september only a few months after ibrahim pasha had assumed office the pasha along with many armed companions left the governor's citadel in cairo in order to open a dyke or a waterwheel in either the shubra or the bulaq district of the city around this time a number of soldiers in his army gathered at the city of the dead necropolis and took an oath on the saints tombs to assassinate the pasha although warned of the rebels intentions ibrahim pasha refused to move away or escape from the project to which he was attending in the presence of several beys and military officials standing by rebel cavalry soldiers approached ibrahim pasha and killed him with their swords ibrahim pasha thus became the first governor of the ottoman empire to be killed by his own troops earning the posthumous epithet maktul meaning the slain after murdering the pasha the rebel soldiers displayed his and some of his men's heads publicly parading them through the streets and then placing them on the gate of bab zuweila where criminals remains were normally displayed allegedly crying this is due to deserved by those who cause strife in the sultan's army the chief kadı judge in the eyalet became acting governor until the sultan could appoint a new one legacy ibrahim pasha's death caused a period of instability and distress in egypt and stability was only restored around or years later when the governor kara mehmed pasha finally crushed the rebellion earning his epithet kul kıran the slavebreaker racine county jane doe racine county jane doe

consort coya of the inca empire by marriage to her brother the sapa inca huáscar r early life chuqui huipa was the daughter of the inca huayna capac and rahua ocllo and thus the full sister of huáscar at the time of her father's death in she her mother and his entire harem was in quito with him her father had willed his throne to his illegitimate son her half brother atahualpa but her legitimate full brother huáscar had the will overturned executed his fathers executors and claimed the throne for himself he then ordered for his mother sister and the rest of the harem to be brought to cuzco as he wished to follow the ancient custom to marry his sister to even more ensure that his own blood line would be completely legitimate marriage the wedding was performed with some difficulty her mother had initially refused to give her consent to it which was crucial for it to take place her reason is reported to have been personal discontent with huáscar and disapproval of his execution of her late husband's executors she is reported to have favored the illegitimate son of her spouse atahualpa who had been brought up in her household before huáscar as the wedding was important for the succession to continue undisturbed this presented a problem for huáscar her mother was finally forced to consent and the wedding and coronation could take place queen the relationship between queen chuqui huipa and huáscar was reportedly not a happy one huáscar viewed his brother atahualpa as a threat and had many people at court executed because he believed their loyalty to be faltering atahualpa who resided in a different part of the realm had been absent from the coronation of huáscar he did however send his loyalists and spokespersons with gifts and greetings to the queen and her mother in cuzco who received them kindly this exposed them both to suspicions from huáscar who assumed them to belong to the opposition and of taking sides with atahualpa against him as soon as the visitors left huáscar caused a scene by entering the queen's audience chamber and accusing the queen's mother of being the prime adviser of atahualpa and them both of disloyalty both the queen and her mother denied the accusations and huáscar was not able to prove anything against them he did however had them placed under guard and spies placed around them to report of their every act the queen reacted very badly to be placed under such circumstances reportedly she took such offence of being put under watch that she refrained from eating during day time and only took one meal during the night to ensure that the spies would have nothing to report not even such innocent activities such as eating her new conditions also caused a depression and she reportedly took to abuse coca both to sleep at night but also during day time the bad relationship between the royal couple was noticed and attracted public attention and bad publicity when huáscar had several members of the embassy atahualpa had

and her mother became even more difficult when atahualpa escaped from his brothers custody they were both reportedly very close to being arrested and executed in huáscar was defeated and taken prisoner by the army of atahualpa who paraded him in public as a prisoner to the capital of cuzco after the battle of quipaipan upon entering the city the loyalists of atahualpa reportedly called rahua ocllo a concubine rather than a queen in order to present huáscar as illegitimate despite this rahua ocllo approached her captive and deposed son by reproaching him in public she explained that

wrote an epithalamium in honour of the marriage of lady magdalen egerton seventh daughter of the earl of bridgwater in whose service he may have been thus it was long assumed that fraunce died in or after more recent scholarship however places fraunce's death in or and attributes the epithalamium to abraham darcie works his works are the lamentations of amintas for the death of phyllis a version

publication of the first books in colin clouts come home again spenser speaks of fraunce as corydon on account of his translations of virgil's second eclogue his poems are written in classical metres

the nativity and passion of christ with versions of some psalms were reprinted by alexander grosart in the third volume of his miscellanies of the fuller worthies library joseph hunter in his chorus vatum stated that five of fraunce's songs were included in sidney's astrophel and stella but these should probably be attributed not to fraunce but to thomas campion see a life prefixed to the

a variety of experiments which he conducted in their home jane and their children also travelled with dee to poland in to work for albertus laski a polish nobleman she had a son while in kraków waiting to join her husband in prague we know a great deal about jane dee because of the detailed diaries and records kept by her husband dee recorded interactions between himself and his wife

investigations he recorded her menstrual cycles their sexual relations and the births of their children as well as investigating their miscarried child in an effort to better understand reproduction in dee began to attempt communications with angels with a new associate edward kelly alias talbot who acted as a scryer jane distrusted kelley from the start and dee records several instances of friction between his wife and associate when kelley married a young wife joanna cooper and according to dee neglected her this may have worsened jane and kelley's relationship since jane sympathised with joanna nevertheless in jane sought kelley's help as she attempted to communicate with these angels she asked them about her family's precarious financial situation and asked for help and reassurance dee's papers record her petition we desire god of his greate and infinite mercies to grant us the helpe of his hevenly mynisters that we may by them be directed how or by whom to be ayded

their philosophical partnership dee initially objected to the arrangement but was convinced by the insistent urging of the angel through kelly when informed of the angels suggested arrangement jane dee objected strenuously and fell a weeping and trembling for a quarter of an hour but john convinced her that it was god's will that the men share everything jane and john and edward kelley and his

that his name was chosen to reference his father a magician by edward kelly dee and kelley's conversations with angels ceased after this communication and their close collaboration ended in when dee and his family returned to england later life and death after their return to england dee continued to record details about jane including their sexual activity and frequent cryptic notes written in

legacy he was one of the more successful serb national leaders of the century giovanni de macque giovanni de macque giovanni de maque jean de macque september was a netherlandish composer of the late renaissance and early baroque who spent almost his entire life in italy he was one of the most famous neapolitan composers of the late century some of his experimentation with chromaticism was likely influenced by carlo gesualdo who was an associate of his life macque was born in valenciennes but moved to vienna at an early age where he sang as a choirboy and where he studied with philippe de monte the renowned composer of madrigals when his voice broke in late the only evidence for his birthdate he was moved out of the choir and into a jesuit college and sometime before he moved to rome where he worked as a composer and as an organist he published his first book of madrigals in in venice which had a much more active publishing industry while in rome he met marenzio and his early book of serious madrigals show marenzio's influence macque moved to naples around where he became famous as the leader of the neapolitan school his first employment there was with the gesualdo household a place he remained until may shortly before the gesualdo murders see carlo gesualdo some of his work at this time is dedicated to carlo as well as the other members of the aristocratic household cesare d'avalos father of carlo's murdered wife as well as fabrizio carlo's father later in however he became organist at santa casa dell'annunziata in naples and in organist to the spanish viceroy naples was a spanish possession at the time in he became maestro di cappella at the chapel royal of naples while maestro di cappella he taught many of the later neapolitan composers including luigi rossi music and influence macque was a prolific madrigalist who published separate books of madrigals although the numbering is confusing for example the primo libro de madrigali for six voices dates from in venice while another primo libro de madrigali for four voices dates from after when he moved to naples his music shifted from the conservative roman style to the more progressive neapolitan one perhaps he began renumbering his publications based on his stylistic change his early and late madrigals include both light and serious music and often require virtuoso singing skill likely some of these pieces were intended for performance by the concerto di donne the three virtuoso female singers at the ducal este court at ferrara which had a strong musical connection with naples throughout the after his music shifted in style again macque began experimenting with chromaticism of the kind found in gesualdo's madrigals most likely the nobleman influenced macque but it is possible that some of the influence went the other way since dating of gesualdo's individual compositions is difficult due to his publication of his work in large blocks many years apart some of the madrigals

possibly born fl was an italian composer of the renaissance active in ferrara known for his madrigals he was the first composer to set the poetry of giovanni battista guarini the most poet by madrigalists of the late century and was an important court composer for the rich musical establishment of the este family in ferrara life details of fiesco's life are sketchy he was probably born in ferrara and seems to have spent most of his life there fétis the french musicologist claimed dates of to for fiesco but as he did not give his sources it is not known if he had access to some documentation no longer extant alfred einstein also reports these dates in the italian madrigal with the additional detail that fiesco was likely a lutenist fiesco was connected to the estense court as indicated by the dedications in his madrigal collections and may have been employed at the church of san francesco since he is buried there it is also possible that he was employed personally by cardinal ippolito ii d'este in the poet giovanni battista guarini entered into the service of alfonso ii d'este duke of ferrara no poet was more influential on music history in the late renaissance than guarini whose works were set more often by madrigal composers than those of any other poet fiesco was significant as the first composer ever to set guarini's poetry to music not only did he set poetry by guarini but in the dedication to the madrigal book he claimed he wrote it at the poet's request and he dedicated the entire group of compositions to lucrezia and leonora d'este fiesco is not mentioned in any known payment records from ferrara a useful source of information on musicians and he vanishes completely from written record around the publication dates of his madrigal collections range from to works and influence all of fiesco's surviving works are secular and vocal he published four books of madrigals in and dedicating all four to members of the este family of these four books the first and last have gotten the most attention his compositions in the first book of show most directly the influence of cipriano de rore the most renowned composer of madrigals who was then the maestro di cappella in ferrara for duke ercole ii d'este fiesco's compositions in this book are for four voices and include madrigals in the classic style chromatically experimental works for example bacio soave which shows also the influence of nicola vicentino who actively encouraged such experiments as well as music likely intended for performance at dramatic events staged for the este family poetry he sets includes works by boccaccio giovanni batista strozzi bernardo tasso sannazaro ludovico ariosto and petrarch fiesco's last book of madrigals the musica nuova for five voices is his most famous for it is the first appearance of the poetry of guarini set to music fourteen out of the fifteen poems in the collection are sonnets and the style matches the elegance of the language attaining considerable virtuosity in text setting some of the settings are innovative harmonically and rhythmically with one madrigal s'armi pur d'ira disdegnoso ed empio foreshadowing the baroque stile concitato of rapid declamation over a homophonic texture not all of fiesco's works are madrigals he published a few secular songs in lighter current forms such as the greghesca and the

collaboration jefferson is an author and editor of the cochrane collaboration's acute respiratory infections group as well as part of four other cochrane groups he is also an advisor to the italian national agency for regional health services in jefferson was one of the founding members of the brighton collaboration along with harald heijbel ulrich heininger and elisabeth loupi he has worked on cochrane reviews examining the effectiveness of the oseltamivir and the influenza vaccine notable work in jefferson was hired by the governments of britain and australia to update a systematic review of oseltamivir initially he had a great deal of trouble getting results of the original trials previous researchers had published trials without seeing the underlying data and it appeared that some of the published papers used ghost writers as the company roche that did the trials refused to provide data for independent analysis their conclusions in were that benefits could not be shown in jefferson's team was provided pages of data from the european medicines agency and roche eventually provided pages of data in jefferson was the lead author of another cochrane review of this data which concluded that oseltamivir did not reduce the number of hospitalizations caused by influenza jefferson said that this review also found no evidence that oseltamivir stopped complications from the disease his views about the effectiveness of influenza vaccines and his outspokenness about them are also controversial at a meeting on pandemic preparedness he was shunned by other vaccine researchers and ate alone reviews led by jefferson have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to show that influenza vaccines reduce mortality or infection rates he has said that the studies claiming large reductions in mortality rates as a result of the influenza vaccine are rubbish and that influenza vaccines are about marketing and not science he has called repeatedly for randomized clinical trials to prove the efficacy of flu vaccines a position that most in the field hold as unethical his views on flu vaccines are opposed by the medical establishment publications jefferson t

christopher was sheriff of county dublin in and is described by raphael holinshed his son in law as the lanthorn lantern and light as well of his house as of that part of ireland where he dwelt who being sufficiently furnished as well with the knowledge of the latin tongue as of the common laws of england was zealously bent to the reformation of his country sir patrick barnewall was the first gentleman's son of quality that was ever put out of ireland to be brought up in learning beyond the seas he succeeded his father in his estates in he married firstly mary st lawrence daughter of

yellow ford in patrick was appointed guardian of his children early career barnewall began to attend the inns of court in london one of the evident tokens of loyalty which led elizabeth i in november to make him a new lease of certain lands without fine for sixty years loyal to the english crown he undoubtedly was but he had inherited in a great degree both the principles and the disposition of his father and was thus inclined to demean himself frowardly when the true interests of ireland were threatened by the government or where he felt the roman catholic faith of which he was a strong and open champion to be in peril charged and imprisoned in december he was brought before the privy council of ireland at dublin on the charge of having organised the petition of the lords and gentlemen of the pale in favour of those persons who had refused to comply with the enactment requiring attendance at a protestant church service on sundays he denied having been the author of the petition but on account of his obstinate and indecent manner of defending it was regarded as having been more deeply implicated in the offence than whoever had actually written it he was therefore retained in prison and ultimately was sent to england where he was committed to the tower of london the timing of the petition was particularly unfortunate in coming so soon after the discovery of the gunpowder plot although it was not suggested that barnewall had any involvement in the plot itself release and later career on account of illness he was however first enlarged i e freed to his own lodgings and on december he was sent back to ireland upon his bond to appear before the lord deputy of ireland and privy council within four days to make his submission while in london he was supposed to have acted as the agent of the recusants in obtaining a relaxation of the law requiring attendance at anglican worship but whether this was so or not his spirited resistance to it had made it practically a dead letter and no attempt was ever again made in ireland to enforce attendance at a protestant church through a fine in the council chamber in he strongly opposed the creation of new boroughs in ireland as being designed only to pass votes and on this account was summoned to england to answer to the council he died on january children his son nicholas became viscount barnewall of kingsland of

paulides david paulides is a former police detective who is now an investigator and writer known primarily for his books one dedicated to proving the reality of bigfoot and his missing series of books in which he documents the disappearance of people in national parks and elsewhere paulides attributes mysterious unspecified causes to these disappearances while data analysis suggests that these disappearances are not statistically mysterious or unexpected early life and career in his online biography page paulides states that he received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from the university of san francisco and in he began a career in law enforcement transferring in to the san jose police department working in the patrol division on the swat team patrol and street crimes unit and a variety of assignments in the detective division in paulides received approval for a deferred vesting status totaling years of service for his time with the san jose police department investigations after leaving the police force paulides wrote books on the topic of bigfoot as well as on the disappearances of people in national parks and elsewhere which he attributes to unspecified unknown causes bigfoot or sasquatch main article bigfoot in his pursuit of bigfoot paulides two books and created the research group called north america bigfoot search for which he serves as director paulides has said north america bigfoot search was instrumental in the genesis of a paper published in which claimed that bigfoot was real the world needs to understand that north america bigfoot search was the organizer of the study we orchestrated the search that led to picking dr ketchum to conduct a study of bigfoot dna the resulting paper documented the analysis of samples of hypothesized bigfoot dna and was written by eleven different authors on november dna diagnostics a veterinary laboratory headed by ketchum issued a press release prior to peer review claiming that their dna sequencing study confirmed the existence of a hominin hybrid cross between modern humans with an unknown primate shortly after publication two months later in the inaugural issue of denovo journal of science the paper was analyzed by sharon hill of doubtful news for the committee for skeptical inquiry hill's report concluded that the paper was of poor quality stating that the few experienced geneticists who viewed the paper reported a dismal opinion of it noting it made little sense the scientist magazine also analyzed the paper reporting that the analyses and data fail to support the claims of existence of a hybrid but rather analyses either come back as percent human or fail in ways that suggest technical artifacts the website for the denovo journal of science was setup sic on february and there is no indication that ketchum's work the only study it has published was peer reviewed the paper failed to influence the scientific consensus that bigfoot is a combination of folklore hoax and misidentification of animals particularly black bears missing following his work on bigfoot paulides next project was missing a series of books and a documentary documenting unsolved cases of people who have gone missing in national parks and elsewhere according to paulides his work on this subject began when he was doing research in a national park and an park ranger found him and expressed concern about the questionable nature of some of the missing person cases which occurred in the parks the ranger knew paulides background and requested for him to research the issue paulides obliged and asserts that he uncovered multiple lines of evidence suggesting negligence on the part of the park service in failing to locate the missing people he broadened his investigation to include missing people from across the world and this led to his belief that he has uncovered a mysterious series of worldwide disappearances which defied logical and conventional explanations as of paulides has written eight books on this topic according to a sobering coincidence he does not yet have a theory on what is causing the disappearances although he indicates that the field of suspects is narrowing paulides advised his readers to go outside of their normal comfort zone to determine who or what is the culprit the interest in the book series prompted the creation of a documentary based on the missing books this film was released in kyle polich a data scientist and host of the data skeptic podcast documented his analysis of paulides claims in the article and presented his analysis to a skepticamp held in by the monterey county skeptics he concluded that the allegedly unusual disappearances represent nothing unusual at all and are instead best explained by causes such as falling or sudden health crises leading to a lone person becoming immobilized drowning bear or other animal attack environmental exposure or even deliberate disappearance after analyzing the missing person data polich concluded that these cases are not outside the frequency that one would expect or that there is anything unexplainable that i was able to identify this presentation was discussed in a february article in skeptical inquirer a publication of the csi in the article susan gerbic reported paulides gave no reason for these disappearances but finds odd correlations for them for example two women missing in different years both had names starting with an a with amy and ann polich concluded in his analysis i've exhausted my exploration for anything genuinely unusual after careful review to me not a single case stands out nor do the frequencies involved seem outside of expectations books bigfoot hoopa project bigfoot encounters tribal bigfoot

appearances gabriel de espinosa portrait of sebastian of portugal impersonated by gabriel de espinosa gabriel de espinosa death in madrigal de las altas torres ávila august was a spanish impostor he was the protagonist of the incident known as the baker of madrigal which consisted of the impersonation of the late king sebastian of portugal for which he was executed background after the disappearance of king sebastian at alcácer quibir many efforts were made to ransom imprisoned portuguese soldiers several soldiers returned to portugal which led many portuguese to believe sebastian had survived the battle and would return to claim his throne this led to sebastianism the belief that sebastian could return at any moment sebastian did not have descendants and thus eventually the throne went to his uncle philip ii of spain losing portugal its independence people involved john of austria father of maría ana de austria maría ana de austria very little is known of espinosa's early years some scholars believe that he was probably born in toledo as this town had he oldest document known about him his title of baker but in madrigal is believed thar he was born there what is known is that in he arrived at madrigal alongside his daughter clara and his wife isabel cid people noticed that the new baker spoke several languages at least french and german knew how to ride a horse and in general appeared to be more than a humble officer although it is not impossible that he had learned these skills working for the militia of captain pedro bermúdez where he served in the same town lived friar miguel de los santos the possible thinker of the scam who had been a confessor in the court of king sebastian and had supported the prior of crato in his intention to succeed said king for that reason he had been exiled from portugal and sent to castile by philip ii the third person involved is maría ana de austria daughter of john of austria she entered the convent of agustinas de madrigal at the age of six sent by his uncle philip ii it seems that she had no religious vocation whatsoever and that she preferred adventure stories especially if they referred to her father or her cousin sebastian whom like many others at the time she believed alive the plot probably friar miguel de los santos noticed the physical resemblance between espinosa and sebastian among other things they were both redheads something unusual in portugal and convinced espinosa to impersonate the late king de los santos also introduced him to ana de austria either because she believed him to actually be her cousin or just because she wanted to escape the convent she agreed to promise in marriage with him until she could obtain permission from the pope sebastian was arrested in valladolid for talking disrespectfully of the king and the jailers found on him letters two by miguel de los santos and two by ana de austria talking about the plot the matter was then referred to the royal court and both miguel and ana were also arrested process conviction and death accused of crimes of lese majesty both espinosa and miguel de los santos were repeatedly interrogated sometimes under torture espinosa made contradictory declarations during the process and he was sentenced to death by hanging on august he remained calm and proud during the execution after the hanging gabriel was decapitated and dismembered and his remains were exposed to the town in each one of the four gates of the wall his head was exposed at the facade of the town hall miguel de los santos was also hanged in plaza mayor madrid he maintained that he believed espinosa to be the king philip ii didn't take a lot of pity on his niece either she was locked in strict closure in the convent of our lady of grace in ávila after the death of philip ii philip iii forgave her and allowed her to return to the convent of madrigal of which she eventually became prior in literature the theme was used in some literary works of the century such as the play traidor inconfeso y mártir by josé zorrilla or the serial el cocinero de su majestad o el pastelero de madrigal by manuel fernández y gonzález henry porter playwright for other people named henry porter see henry porter disambiguation henry porter died june was an english dramatist who is known for one surviving play the two angry women of abington and for the manner of his death he was stabbed by another playwright life very little is known about henry porter's life beyond the entries in the diary of philip henslowe the theatre manager he is described as a gentleman and a poor scholar and as the play is set in abingdon near oxford and shows knowledge of the area around oxford it is assumed he studied there attempts to plausibly connect him with the records of the several henry porters at oxford have been fruitless he is known for one surviving play the two angry women of abington first published in two editions in london in the two angry women was written before his first recorded work for henslowe in porter was praised by francis meres in his palladis tamia in as one of the best for comedy amongst us there is linguistic evidence that he may have contributed comic scenes to dr faustus by christopher marlowe works the two angry women of abington has been compared favourably in style and quality to the merry wives of windsor it is a rollicking country piece including two comic characters dick coomes and nicholas proverbes who are advertised in the title page of one original edition henslowe records several payments in for the book and costumes for the play but it must have been performed before as there is a reference to these characters in plaine percevall a pamphlet published that year in response to martin marprelate henslowe's diary mentions other plays love prevented hot anger soon cold with henry chettle and ben jonson the second part of the two angry women of abingdon the four merry women of abingdon and the spencers with chettle it is possible that the second part of the two angry women was not a separate work and it is not known whether the later plays were delivered before porter's death in porter and chettle were paid shillings by henslowe to write a play called the second part of black batman of the north it has been suggested that some of the money received from henslowe by porter was used to pay chettle's debts the considerable sums paid to porter prove that his plays were popular although the entries suggest he was unreliable henslowe notes that the advance to porter and chettle was made after porter hath geven me his worde for the performance of the same and all so for my money in february henslowe acquired the sole rights of any play in which porter had a hand in return for a considerable advance of forty shillings porter's borrowings became more frequent and the sums allowed less death it is likely that the publication of the two angry women of abington was prompted by porter's death the last definite record of him is an iou in his hand in henslowe's diary on may leslie hotson discovered the record of a case in the southwark assizes which records the death of a henry porter on june in southwark he is recorded as having been struck a mortal wound in the left breast with a rapier of the value of two shillings the previous day the killer is named as john day almost certainly the playwright of that name who worked for philip henslowe although collaboration was common there is no record of porter and day working together ben jonson with whom porter did collaborate described day as a rogue and a base fellow day was charged with murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of his plea in formal terms being that he fled to a certain wall beyond which etc although it is not recorded he seems to have obtained a royal pardon the rapier was a fashionable but particularly dangerous weapon more likely to cause death than traditional swords it is ironic that one of the characters in the two angry women laments this poking fight of a rapier and dagger saying that a good man will be spitted like a cat or a coney the irony would be greater still if the author of this was the same henry porter granted a pardon de se defendendo there are parallels between the deaths of henry porter and his fellow playwright christopher marlowe both were stabbed to death south of the thames in london marlowe in deptford in and porter in southwark in both deaths were explicated in modern times by leslie hotson roger mason musician for other people with the

was according to the opinion of the lovers of truth a wise man pious righteous and shunning evil neither did he ever teach any law or practice contrary to the written law only after his death a quarrel arose between his followers and those who had opposed him because of his wisdom which was rooted in the law and not in their rabbinical additions and many of these disciples of his sent forth

constantinople paisius ii kioumourtzoglou greek παΐσιος β κιουμουρτζόγλου december was ecumenical patriarch of constantinople for four times in the century life paisius was born in caesarea and his family name was kioumourtzoglou a turkish name as common among the mainly karamanli cappadocian greeks he probably moved early to istanbul and became metropolitan of nicomedia surely before probably in the first time that paisius was elected as patriarch of constantinople was november the day when callinicus iii was found dead by heart attack before his enthronement paisius was immediately chosen by the faction that previously elected callinicus to preclude a return to the throne of jeremias iii the first years of his reign were marked by clashes with the faction gathered around the community of caesarea whose main representatives were jeremias iii and later neophytus vi despite the fact that paisius himself was born in this town in this faction tried to depose him and to restore jeremias but failed a second attempt in september was successful when jeremias iii overthrew him when later jeremias had to retire due to health problems a patriarch from nicomedia serapheim i followed and later again one from caesarea neophytus vi who reigned six years the reign of neophytus vi was ended by a decision of the grand vizier who allowed paisius to be reinstalled for his second term in august however three years later in may paisius was deposed by the ottoman authorities for financial issues and neophytus vi was restored the third reign of paisius began in march when he overthrew neophytus shortly after however a new opponent arose the metropolitan of nicomedia and future patriarch cyril v karakallos who voiced the complaints against him and was able to depose him on september the complaints were due mainly to paisius financial management of the millet the christian civil community ruled by the patriarch to reduce the high levels of debts paisius increased the taxation particularly of the laity and this caused discontent with him paisius ii's fourth term was an interlude in the reign of cyril v and began in last days of may when cyril was actually deposed by the metropolitans both because of his regulations on taxes and because of his strong position in favor of the necessity of re baptism of armenian and latin converts cyril however was supported by a large portion of the populace and by the demagogic monk auxentios who instigated riots which culminated in a violent assault on the patriarchate and the seizure of paisius himself paisius was subsequently deposed and cyril v was reinstated on september after a gift to the ottoman authorities of piastres after his fourth and final deposition paisius retired in the monastery of kamariotissa on island of

abraham ben elijah of vilna was a jewish talmudist who lived in lithuania there is some debate as to when he was born some place his birth as early as but more recent scholarship suggests he was actually born in he was born in vilna and died there on december he was the son of elijah the vilna gaon the most famous talmudist of modern times he was educated under the supervision of his father who was famous both for his opposition to both the hasidic movement and the dry scholasticism which dominated the rabbinic leadership of poland at that time according to the custom of the time he married at the age of twelve but continued his studies in the talmudic colleges in other cities and after a few years returned home where he completed his studies under his father like his father he never officiated as rabbi but was a highly respected member of the jewish community of vilna in which he held various offices works it was due to his father's influence that he developed a literary activity of a far more scientific character than was usually found at that age or in that country especially interested in the history of the old homiletical literature he edited the midrash agadat bereshit with a number of other mostly pseudepigraphic works of similar character vilna adding valuable notes in the preface of this edition he makes the first known attempt to give a complete history of the midrashic literature a plagiarist jacob ben naphtali herz of brody reprinted this edition with the preface zolkiev but was careful to omit the name of elijah gaon wherever the son had mentioned him he omitted also on the the mention of abraham of vilna's edition referring only to the one which had been printed in venice in this introduction was only part of his greater work rav po'alim of many works published by simon chones warsaw this book is an alphabetical index of all midrashim known to the author it seems that abraham of vilna believed literally in the statement that the eighty concubines of king solomon shir rabbah meant eighty midrashim this is at least testified to by samuel luria in a letter to simon chones rab po'alim the book however contains over one hundred and twenty midrashic works while abraham of vilna shows greater interest in literature and literary questions than is found among his contemporaries he accepts traditional attributions of authorship he ascribes the zohar to shimon bar yochai in spite of the many arguments against its authenticity produced by various writers since the time of abraham zacuto he accepts that the book was not written down until generations after bar yochai's death he also believed in the traditional attribution of the pirke d rabi eliezer secular knowledge abraham's interest in secular knowledge quite rare in his environment is also manifest in the writing of a hebrew geography gebulot ereẓ published anonymously berlin the book is in fact a translation of parts of leclerc de buffon's histoire naturelle he edited menahem mendel's index to the zohar tamim yaḥdaw to which he added an introduction and notes vilna of his numerous manuscripts which contained glosses to the talmud midrash shulkan aruk and explanatory notes to his father's works a commentary on the introduction to the tikkune zohar vilna a commentary on psalms באר אברהם warsaw sa'arat eliyahu exegetical notes and biographical data about

catholic divine life ely was the brother of william ely president of st john's college oxford and was a native of herefordshire after studying at brasenose college oxford he was elected a scholar of st john's college in on account of his attachment to the catholic faith he left the university without a degree he went to the english college at douay where he was made a licentiate in the canon and civil laws he appears to have been subsequently created in july he and other students of law formed a community in the town of douay and resided together in a rented house this establishment was soon broken up by the troubles with local calvinists ely was hooted as a traitor in the streets of douay and the members of his community and of the english college were subjected to frequent domiciliary visits which satisfied the municipal authorities but not the populace in consequence william allen found it necessary to move the college from douay to rheims in after studying divinity at rheims ely accompanied allen to rome in august when the dissensions had occurred in the english college there but he returned with him to rheims in the following spring during his stay in rome allen employed him in revising several controversial books in june he visited england disguised as a merchant travelling under the name of havard or howard sailing with him were three priests edward rishton thomas cottam and john hart on their landing at dover the searchers arrested cottam and hart the mayor supposing that ely was a military man requested him to convey cottam to london and hand him over to lord cobham governor of the cinque ports when they were out of the town ely allowed his prisoner to go at large cottam entertaining scruples about the danger that his friend might incur insisted upon delivering himself up and was afterwards executed ely was committed to prison but soon obtained his release probably on account of his not being a priest on april he arrived at rheims out of spain and in the following month visited paris in company with allen he was ordained subdeacon at laon on march deacon at on the of the same month and priest on april on july he left rheims for where he had been appointed by the duke of lorraine to the professorship of the canon and civil laws and he occupied that chair till his death on march he was buried in the church of the nuns of the order of st clare works he wrote certaine briefe notes vpon a briefe apologie set out vnder the name of the priestes vnited to the archpriest drawn by an vnpassionate secular prieste friend to bothe partyes but more frend to the truth whereunto is added a seuerall answeare vnto the particularites obiected against certaine persons paris this work elicited by robert parsons's brief apology was written by ely shortly before his death and published by an anonymous editor probably dr christopher bagshaw it was a contribution to the archpriest controversy ely wrote in english with a view to publication the lives of some of the martyrs in elizabeth's reign as appears from a letter addressed by him from june or july to father john gibbons s j rector of the college of treves master of the aachen altar aachen altar centrepiece with the crucifixion of christ the notname master of the aachen altar is given to an anonymous late gothic painter active in cologne between and or and named for his master work the aachen altar triptych owned by the aachen cathedral treasury along with the master of st severin and the master of the legend of st ursula he is part of a group of painters who were active in cologne at the beginning of the sixteenth century and were cologne's last significant practitioners of late gothic painting mass of saint gregory style like all the painters of cologne in the second half of the fifteenth century the master of the aachen altar cannot be identified with any of the artists named in archives of the period since sure dates and sources are almost entirely lacking works must be attributed by means of stylistic comparisons what distinguishes his work from his contemporaries is the vigorous temperament which he invested in his images this manifests in the restless movement of his figures densely packed scenes turbulent compositions rich oppositions atmospheric landscapes contemporary architectural themes and the brightness of his colours surprising often drastic external influences characterise his work such as the naturalistic depictions of the symptoms of a syphilitic man and a child with down syndrome on the aachen altar in his depiction of individuals the master of the aachen altar demonstrates an ability to create individualised portraits as in the lifelike depiction of the establisher of a stift on the reredos in liverpool as well as the depiction of johann von melem the younger the son of the patrician of frankfurt johann von melem this image is now on display in the alte pinakothek in munich and is usually ascribed to the master of the aachen altar that johann von melem the younger as well as his the mayor of cologne and wholesale merchant hermann rinck were among the painter's clients in addition to creating the aachen altar for a carmelite religious order and a wall painting for the cologne family of hardenrath shows the high esteem which the master of the aachen altar enjoyed influences and impacts the roots of the master of the aachen altar in cologne painting is beyond question his proximity to the master of the holy clan which is clear both in stylistic matters and in the adoption of subjects and motifs leads to the assumption that the master of the aachen altar was educated in the workshop of the master of the holy clan the master of st severin also had an important influence on the master of the aachen altar as similarities in their figures and painting methods indicate a partnership as journeymen in this workshop is possible the mature works of the master of the aachen altar such as the mary panels show clear influence from the master of the saint bartholomew altarpiece further afield the painter has taken important hints from the netherlandish painters such as the art of hugo van der goes the impact that the master had on later painters does not seem to have been great however some works of barthel bruyn the elder reveal a detailed awareness of the work of the master of the aachen altar and suggest the bruyn had frequently interacted with the compositions of the earlier master works the time between the earliest work the adoration of the kings in bonn or the portrait of johann von melem and his last work the aachen altar gives a floruit of a good twenty years a longer period of activity cannot be attributed to the master only a relatively small number of works can be identified

aunt anne cusacke adam was appointed second justice of the provincial court of connacht in and became the last chief justice of connacht in on the abolition of that office in he was appointed a justice of the court of common pleas ireland in the relaxed political atmosphere of the early his background and tolerant attitude to roman catholics were not a professional disadvantage he had also the advantage of having married catherine keating sister of john keating later to be chief justice of the irish common pleas and niece of maurice eustace lord chancellor of ireland the only serious objection to his appointment to the high court bench was his health from early middle age onwards he suffered badly from gout which became so severe that he was unable to perform his judicial duties for at least two years he died aged only about in and was buried in st audoen's church dublin in his will which according to elrington ball shows his kindly and charitable nature he left money to the poor of st audoen's parish and of rathfarnham for the relief of poor prisoners and bequests to the bluecoat school at oxmantown and to the army hospital at back lane dublin the bulk of his estate was left to his widow catherine who remarried his cousin nicholas cusack she and adam had no children rathgar castle fell into decay in the eighteenth century and was a ruin by when the artist gabriel beranger did a watercolour which shows two men surveying the remains the castle's precise location is something of a mystery but it probably stood on what is now highfield road at the present site of st luke's hospital rathgar it was built by the segrave family in the sixteenth century on what had previously been monastic land and was bought by adam's grandfather john in abgar ali akbar armani abgar was an armenian of the safavid empire who lived during the reign of shah king suleiman i originally a merchant he later converted from christianity to shia islam and took the name abgar ali akbar armani over time he became estranged from the armenian community and increasingly associated with members of the safavid clergy and later married into their families he wrote a conversion narrative in persian the eterāfnāme confession book which was conceived perhaps as a missionary tool and for circulation among armenian christians according to alberto tibrucio this work fills an important gap as a rare example of a testimony narrated from the perspective of a convert and portraying a voluntary conversion biography what little is known about his life is largely drawn from his work the eterāfnāme confession book born abgar possibly in new julfa the armenian quarter of isfahan he spent the early part of his life as a merchant he may have been a member of either the renowned velijanian or veligianian merchant family of venice or the sceriman shahremanian family although the latter is considered less likely around during the reign of safavid shah king suleiman i he converted from christianity to shia islam a decision which according to his writings was inspired by a scriptural evidence as well as a series of visions and dreams at the time of his conversion he had been in contact with the armenian mayor kalāntar of new julfa hajji piri who was also a convert armani reportedly became estranged from his family after being branded an apostate his subsequent trip to venice resulted in his imprisonment in retaliation for allegations of mistreatment of christians in iran but he was later released through the intervention of his brother after his release he journeyed to the ottoman cities of constantinople and belgrade before returning to isfahan via the safavid cities of erivan tabriz and mashhad he is known to have married on numerous occasions and sired a number of children with his various wives after his conversion he increasingly associated with members of the safavid ulama and would marry into their families his first wife whom he met her during his journey was the daughter of a judge and hailed from constantinople according to alberto tiburcio he was persecuted in constantinople for his assumed shi'i allegiance as an iranian however it appears that at the time armani was not yet an adherent of shia islam at least not initially but had developed a shi'ite identity through the course of his journey in later life his relations with the armenian community would deteriorate to the point that he became a target of their persecution tiburcio wrote that in retaliation armani claims to have engaged in a cursing of armenian priests leading to the death of the latter armani died sometime after january possibly in isfahan work armani's work the eterāfnāme was completed on january and was written entirely in persian only one manuscript of this conversion narrative consisting of folios is extant and is stored in the university of tehran according to tiburcio the eterāfnāme though written in persian was probably conceived as a missionary tool and for circulation among armenian christians as far as the surviving evidence suggests its prose is simple yet rich in symbolism and describes armani's conversion and travels his use of oneiric elements in his work to describe his spiritual journey into islam has led tiburcio to suggest that he had access to conversion narratives stemming from other milieus the work also includes the standard biblical reference to the paraclete of the gospel of john an example of polemic often used in conversion narratives to express proof for islam from the bible though the persian chronicles european travelogues and correspondences between christian missionaries reveal that many converted from christianity to islam during the safavid period they only depict instances where the converts were either forced to convert or did so out of convenience such accounts generally do not provide insights into the personal views of the converts according to tiburcio the eterāfnāme fills an important gap as a rare example of a testimony narrated from the perspective of a convert and portraying a voluntary conversion oliver fitzwilliam earl of tyrconnell oliver fitzwilliam earl of tyrconnell died april was an irish nobleman his father was thomas fitzwilliam viscount fitzwilliam his mother was margaret plunkett daughter of oliver plunkett baron louth through his mother he was related to the powerful bagenal family as a younger son he did not expect to inherit the title or estates like many young men in his position he read law studying at gray's inn and then resolved on a military career with the help of james butler duke of ormonde he became a colonel in the french army and showed both courage and military skill on the death of his eldest brother richard he became heir to the title civil war he was both a catholic and a royalist and enjoyed the confidence of queen henrietta maria who recommended him to charles i as a man deserving of every encouragement in he tried to get the confederation of kilkenny to support king charles i in the english civil war on the grounds that their demands for full civic rights to be restored to roman catholics would be met he fought with the confederates against the parliamentarians in and led a successful assault on roscommon castle in in he was imprisoned in london but soon released after some time in france he was allowed to return to england through the pleas of his john holles earl of clare he is said to have been one of the few irishmen whom oliver cromwell admired and was also on good terms with oliver's son henry cromwell although henry refused his request to be allowed to recover possession of his principal residence merrion castle during the commonwealth he seems to have played a careful double game his second marriage into the holles family put him in the parliamentarian camp but he was also suspected of working for the restoration of charles ii restoration at the restoration he was in high favour at court and was made earl of tyrconnell whether for personal reasons or because his friendly relations with henry cromwell had made him powerful enemies at home and despite a personal plea on his behalf by the king it was not until that he recovered all his properties he devoted his last years to renovating merrion castle he died at merrion castle on april and was buried on april in the fitzwilliam chapel in donnybrook church his widow eleanor returned to england and died there in family he married firstly dorothy brereton of malpas a cousin of sir william brereton baronet her sister jane married oliver's brother christopher secondly a miss penruddock and thirdly lady eleanor holles daughter of john holles earl of clare and his wife anne stanhope he had no issue by any of his marriages on his death the earldom of tyrconnell became extinct and the viscountcy passed to his brother william alexander a balandin alexander a balandin is an electrical engineer and materials

marsh and patrick humphries rock music journalists he also was a contributing writer to a biography about the monkees pop group and a correspondent for uncut magazine hogan is the of noted uk comic guru rian hughes after revolver folded hogan became a scriptwriter for the ad comic working on short story series vector and tharg's dragon tales as well as reinventing the strontium dog series as strontium dogs and supervising the durham red series hogan also had a short stint working on sam slade he also created the gentle fantasy timehouse hogan's writing is noted for a whimsical fantastic quality that stood out from the more usual to appear under the ad banner however when david bishop took on the editorship of ad he informed hogan that he would commission no more of hogan's scripts because he didn't believe his writing fitted the comic he wanted ad to be the two commissioned scripts strontium dogs hate and war and durham red night of the hunters were heavily rewritten and hogan asked for his name to be removed they were credited to alan smithee with hindsight bishop says he was rightly furious about having his work summarily rewritten and demanded his name taken off the scripts which i did i regret the brutal way i treated peter i was in a hurry to make changes and he caught the full force of that haste hogan went on to write books covering the bands rem queen and the doors in the hogan wrote for some titles on dc comics vertigo imprint including the dreaming and the sandman presents love street most recently his unpublished followup to the latter the sandman presents marquee moon was published online like love street marquee moon is a to neil gaiman's the sandman and offers a look at the early days of john constantine of swamp thing and hellblazer fame in addition hogan has worked with alan moore on moore's america's best comics series including his own title terra obscura he also wrote three issues of tom strong with artist chris sprouse and the two of them returned to the character in with the limited series tom strong and the robots of doom known with great affection by many of the ealing lot as the count for his legendary nocturnal working habits tugal caris tugal caris late century or also spelled carris or cariste was a french sculptor and architect biography caris was born in the late sixteenth century or early seventeenth century in he was associated in a market with jean martinet for the purchase of carts of stones from the couldre and bootz quarries at changé he then lived in laval this purchase did not concern the construction of altarpieces he was the husband of jeanne barais probably the sister of catherine barais wife of the architect michel bellier they had several children including a son jacques caris who moved to nantes where after having been associated with his father he became an architect origins marie bellier wife of antoine agenyau architect michel bellier architect husband of catherine barais louise bellier wife of philippe bault lawyer at rennes guillaume bellier renée bellier wife of jean martinet architect olivier martinet architect lavallois rededos his first known altarpiece is that of vaiges now missing built in he can probably also be attributed the realization of the altar at in and the altar at in from to he erected the altarpiece of the abbey of redon caris is also attributed the two side altars of this church but which do not date from the same period in june he was in laval where he contested the quality of the marble ordered from étienne arnoul and asked for an expertise from pierre corbineau and jean martinet after redon's realization he made an altarpiece at the church of the cordeliers of rennes in then from to the high altar of the church of laval around he made the main altarpiece of the tréguier cathedral at the same time he raised two altarpieces at in he realized the high altar and the altar of the rosary of the church of the reredos of the right altar representing the virgin mary is composed of small medallions in each medallion a mystery of the rosary is represented as a scene altarpiece of the rosary of the church of main altar and altarpiece church of brée attributed to tugal caris architect at rennes and nantes after the lavallois reredos he moved to architecture and was entrusted with the realization of the façade of the rennes cathedral he built the large portal and part of the towers from to he then became entrepreneur du palace of rennes whose construction he resumed after jacques corbineau he signed with the community of the city of rennes on april for the continuation of work on the side of the cordeliers he then lived in rennes where he directed the most important works in he built two side altarpieces and the main altar of as well as that of rannée he is also attributed the altarpiece of the high altar of the church of tinténiac nevertheless the work carried out at the palace of parliament of brittany was deemed not to conform to the plans and specifications drawn up by salomon de brosse in and was destroyed in by order of the parliament of brittany caris was dispossessed of his office for the benefit of pierre corbineau in he left rennes for nantes where he built a convent and private mansions it is possible that he was at this time between nantes rennes where he managed the cathedral site until and gaël where he raised the altarpiece of the high altar in he seems to leave rennes in definitively the cathedral site was also taken over by pierre corbineau the construction of the cathedral in rennes was eventful tugal caris must start again in in granite instead of the tufa initially chosen according to léon palustre tugal caris would have led the work to the cornice on the first floor after him from to pierre corbineau completed the superposition of the three orders and placed the coat of arms of louis xiv above the immense window in the façade of the monument then françois huguet cleared the two towers gave them two independent floors and in put the finishing touches to this work he brought the levels to their current height of metres and added on the pediment at the top of the façade louis xiv's motto nec pluribus impar the unparalleled caris completeed the rededo of the altar in one of the chapels of the nantes cathedral circa the same year he was awarded the contract for the cathedral's works il meurt à nantes en ou peter love for the american politician lawyer and jurist see peter early love peter love died was an english pirate said to have been born in lewes sussex he was the captain of the priam and for a time occupied a base on the isle of lewis in the outer hebrides when he entered into an agreement with the hebridean outlaw neil macleod from his base of operations on lewis love captured numerous ships and seized their cargo macleod however betrayed love and handed him over to the scottish authorities as a result love and several members of his crew were found guilty of piracy and condemned to be hanged in macleod did not much outlive love since he was betrayed by his kinsman rory mor macleod of harris and dunvegan and executed for high treason three years later background peter love was stated to have been born in lewes sussex england some time in the century he was a notable pirate of his era his ship was called the priam allegiance with the outlaw neil macleod location of bearasaigh according to early historian william cook mackenzie love and the priam had narrowly escaped capture off the coast of ireland when he dropped anchor near bernera within loch roag lewis the priam was full of cargo which consisted of cinnamon ginger pepper cochineal sugar indian hides and pieces of silver plate which had been looted from an english ship a box containing various precious stones of great value which had been looted from a dutch ship as well as a large number of muskets during this time a hebridean outlaw dwelt in the immediate area his name was neil macleod the son of old ruari the late chief of the macleods of lewis macleod had for years been fighting various invading forces on lewis at the turn of the century the fife adventurers had attempted to colonise the island and later kenneth mackenzie of kintail took over where they had left off mackenzie of kintail was granted a commission of fire and sword by the government and successfully took control of lewis however macleod and a small band of followers took refuge and fortified themselves on the remote stack on the tiny island of bearasaigh within loch roag bearasaigh is located at grid reference the pirate love and the outlaw macleod soon struck up a working friendship after setting up a base in the area and an agreement with macleod the pirates resumed their trade and captured a lowland scottish ship owned by thomas fleming ritchieson of anstruther whom they detained as a prisoner they also captured a flemish ship and transferred five of her crew to work as slaves and replaced them with a similar number of pirates on board this flemish ship was later driven by bad weather onto the coast of shetland where the crew was forced to go ashore mackenzie related one account which stated that the friendship between love and macleod was so strong that love was about to marry a daughter of torquil blair macleod who is described as neil macleod's aunt mackenzie noted that this is obviously an error of some sort as torquil is a masculine name and proposed that torquil blair may have been an illegitimate son of old ruari the late chief of the macleods of lewis later the clan historian alec morrison stated that neil actually married the daughter of torquil blair macleod capture and execution neil macleod however betrayed love and during a feast attempted to seize the pirates some of the pirates were killed during a desperate scuffle but love and the priam were captured by macleod and his men the four dutchmen who had been enslaved by the pirates were freed and sent across lewis and a scotsman who was also enslaved was detained by macleod who waited for instructions from the privy council according to tradition there was an abundance of money aboard the priam which was divided and lotted amongst macleod and his followers by using the helmet of donald cam macaulay mackenzie noted that there is no mention of money in the official records found on board the priam her cargo of spices were of little use to outlaws but money was of great use mackenzie noted that macleod's capture of love would have served two purposes providing him with a wealth of money and giving him a means of reconciliation with the government macleod sent a messenger to inform the privy council macleod's version of events related to the privy council was that he was not personally present during the seizure of love and the priam according to mackenzie the reason that macleod distanced himself from the actual event was so that he could not be held responsible if his men were thought to have helped themselves to the loot mackenzie also considered it quite likely that when the priam was finally handed over to representatives of the government anything of use to neil and his men would not have been found on board love and nine of his men were handed over to patrick grieve and were tried in edinburgh on december the men were a mixture of nationalities englishmen johnne cokis williame hollane anthony colenis and abraham mathie welshmen dauid howart and nicolas phillopes and irishman jasperd staffurd mackenzie stated that the other two men handed over to grieve appeared to have died of their wounds before the trial the pirates were all found guilty and were condemned to be hanged on the sands of leith to be tane to ane gibbet vpone the sandis of leyth within the and thair to be hangit quhill thay be deid macleod did not last much longer than love in he was forced from his fortified stack and fled to harris and the protection of his kinsman chief rory mor macleod of harris and dunvegan macleod of harris and dunvegan promised to take macleod to london where macleod hoped he could obtain a pardon from the king but upon reaching glasgow macleod of harris and dunvegan gave up macleod and his son donald to the authorities according to mackenzie accounts macleod of harris and dunvegan had only taken macleod to glasgow under the pretence of taking him to the king in the end macleod was found guilty of high treason and hanged in april his son was banished to england bartolomé de argüelles bartolomé de argüelles was the lieutenant treasurer royal accountant and governor of la florida with alonso de las alas and juan menéndez márquez he served as lieutenant treasurer during the administration of governor pedro menéndez de márquez career in during the governorship of pedro menéndez márquez the english privateer francis drake attacked and burned st augustine san agustín the capital of florida la florida destroying many documents including records of account so that argüelles had to make a new inventory of property that remained after the fire when governor domingo martínez de avendaño died in the three treasury officials treasurer juan menéndez márquez accountant bartolomé de argüelles and alonso de las alas became acting of la florida note at the time of death argüelles was in mexico city to retrieve the situado the annual subsidy from the treasury of new spain to support the presidio at st augustine menéndez márquez and las alas were reported to have quarrelled over the governance of florida until argüelles returned from mexico city argüelles who had been in florida since the and had become accountant in aspired to be governor note argüelles sent a petition to be appointed as governor to the king shortly after death the king turned down request and appointed gonzalo méndez de cancio y donlebún who had never been to florida as governor méndez arrived at st augustine in soon after méndez reached st augustine he encountered resistance over a payment from the royal treasury to the new garrison priest father ricardo argüelles and las alas refused to make the payment saying that there was no authorization for it menéndez márquez sided with governor méndez on the issue shortly afterwards méndez charged las alas with embezzling funds from the royal treasury and suspended him from office las alas claimed that méndez and menéndez márquez had conspired against him the king had given governor méndez authorization to name his own lieutenant and successor and méndez chose his nephew juan garcía de navia rather than attack governor méndez directly argüelles conducted a campaign against garcía and other officials appointed by méndez and against handling of the guale rebellion alarmed at repeated incursions into the province of guale by french sassafras traders who were coming and going unmolested in the harbors of the coast argüelles implored governor menéndez márquez to send timucuan allies with spanish troops to seize their canoes and burn their food crops as well as to seize some of the young men and enslave them menéndez successor méndez de canço employed these tactics thus reviving war of fire and blood against the rebel guale fernando de alva cortés ixtlilxóchitl fernando de alva cortés ixtlilxóchitl between and was a castizo nobleman of the spanish viceroyalty of new spain modern mexico life born between and alva cortés ixtlilxóchitl was a direct descendant of ixtlilxochitl i and ixtlilxochitl ii who had been tlatoque rulers of texcoco he was also the of cuitláhuac cuitláhuac was the eleventh son of the ruler axayacatl and a younger brother of moctezuma ii the previous ruler of tenochtitlan the penultimate aztec ruler of tenochtitlan and victor of la noche triste on the death of his eldest brother in he was declared by a royal decree heir to the titles and possessions of his family the property however does not appear to have been large as he complained in of the deplorable state of misery to which the posterity of the kings of texcoco were reduced he was a distinguished student at the imperial colegio de santa cruz de tlatelolco where he was educated in both nahuatl and spanish he lived in san juan teotihuacán from to in he was employed as interpreter by the viceroy which appointment he owed to his learning and skill in explaining the hieroglyphic pictures of the ancient mexicans he had also a profound knowledge of the traditions of his ancestors which were preserved in the national songs and was intimate with several old native americans famous for their knowledge of mexican history he turned his own labors and those of his friends to account in composing works on the history of his country they remained unknown until their importance was revealed by clavijero and afterward by humboldt the former says that they were written in spanish by command of the viceroy and were deposited in the library of the jesuits in mexico there were copies also in other libraries in he was governor of texcoco and in governor of tlalmanalco in spite of his illustrious birth good education and obvious ability he lived most of his life in dire poverty most of his works were written to relieve his wants he died in mexico city in works he was commissioned by the spanish viceroy of new spain to write histories of the indigenous peoples of mexico his relación histórica de la nación tulteca usually called relación was written between and this was an account of many events in new spain and many events of the toltec people the relación and most of his other accounts and compilations contain writing fragments and songs with much repetition and little organization he gives a detailed account of the important part played by his don fernando ixtlilxóchitl ii in the conquest of mexico and the pacification of the indigenous of new spain praising him in every possible way and condemning the ingratitude of the conquerors later to according to chavero alva wrote the spanish work historia chichimeca which refers to the same events but with more organization historia chichimeca is not the original title which is unknown but was supplied by carlos de sigüenza y góngora when the manuscript was in his possession lorenzo boturini bernaducci who owned the same manuscript later called it historia general de la nueva españa there are indications it was part of a larger work the rest of which has been lost or perhaps it was unfinished it ends with the siege of mexico the work gives the texcoca version of history and the conquest in contrast to the work of fernando alvarado tezozómoc which gives the mexica version the historia chichimeca is considered alva's best work his works contain very important data for the history of mexico but except for historia chichimeca they are written without order or method the chronology is very faulty and there is much repetition alfredo chavero published his works annotated with the title of obras históricas historical works in josé ignacio dávila garibi reproduced that edition with a new prologue in the codex ixtlilxochitl is attributed to him he wrote two memorials sucinta and sumaria addressed to viceroy luis de velasco hijo and fray garcía guerra these were attempts to recover some of the property and privileges of his royal ancestors partly owing to these appeals and partly to the favor of fray garcía guerra who afterwards became archbishop of mexico and viceroy of new spain some land concessions were granted him and in the last years of his life he was appointed interpreter in the indian judiciary court he was still working there when he died in poor and forgotten his son juan de alva cortes

footballer pedro teixeira died july was a portuguese explorer who became in the first european to travel up the entire length of the amazon river teixeira was born at cantanhede the date of his birth is unknown his exploits are considered remarkable even by today's standards because of teixeira and other portuguese who pushed into the depths of the amazon portugal was able to obtain far more of south america from their spanish competitors than the treaty of tordesillas had granted in expedition became the first simultaneously to travel up and down the amazon river he was called by the indian natives meaning the good and friendly white man amazon expedition in two franciscan friars under threats from nearby natives abandoned their mission on the amazon river and with six soldiers paddled a canoe up the entire length of the river to the principal portuguese settlement of fort presépio their arrival led the portuguese to wonder how far east the spaniards had settled the amazon although spain and portugal were both under the rule of philip iv of spain philip iii of portugal trading rivalry was nevertheless intense and there was a strong movement towards the restoration of the portuguese independence which did take place in consequently the governor of maranhão jacome raimundo de noronha lost no time in commissioning an expedition under the command of captain pedro de teixeira teixeira already had considerable experience exploring the amazon and the xingu river leading expeditions to expel english and dutch traders and settlers one of the franciscan friars andres de toledo was dispatched to lisbon to report his expedition to the portuguese authorities so teixeira became the first european to travel up the amazon river reaching quito by way of the napo river the portuguese expedition was a large one consisting of canoes powered by natives and negroes to transport fully armed portuguese soldiers and their cargo of food weapons ammunition and barter goods feeding so many over a journey of several months was a formidable task demanding the most of the explorers hunting fishing and food gathering skills and often requiring barter with local tribes the journey upstream against a strong current was arduous and advance parties were regularly sent out to reconnoiter the way ahead in order to identify the correct fork in the river to take teixeira also had difficulty persuading the natives to stay with the expedition as it got farther from their homes during the expedition pedro teixeira explored the mouth of the rio negro and discovered the madeira river who explored in the downstream part and baptized with this name the madeira river and the mamoré and guaporé rivers linked to it would become decisive for the great journey of discovery conducted by antónio raposo tavares flag from to after eight months the portuguese reached the first spanish settlement on the rio quijos at this stage teixeira divided the expedition sending eight canoes ahead whilst the remainder were to stay at the settlement for the return journey the rio quijos was eventually abandoned when the current grew too strong and the rest of the journey was completed on foot after almost one year in the expedition reached quito to a rousing reception return journey although the spaniards of peru afforded the portuguese explorers every hospitality they were nevertheless concerned to know how far the portuguese had settled the amazon based on the treaty of tordesillas of and the strength of the expedition of francisco de orellana the spanish considered the amazon theirs consequently teixeira and his party were detained several weeks in quito whilst the spanish authorities decided what to do in the end it was decided to send a party of jesuit priests headed by cristóbal de acuña to accompany the portuguese on their return journey and report all they observed father cristóbal was to present his report to the royal council of the indies father cristobal's report was published as a book in in it he gives a glowing account the amazon regions and is especially complimentary towards the indigenous brazilian natives and their way of life the expedition itself appears to have been uneventful apart from a disagreement between the jesuits and the portuguese officers over a proposed slaving expedition up the rio negro teixeira gave way to the jesuits over the slaving issue and the expedition eventually reached belém on december just over two years after it had set out although father cristóbal urged spain to lose no time in settling the amazon his advice came too late in king joão iv was proclaimed king of portugal and in the portuguese of the colony of brazil also recognized him as such little is known about pedro teixeira apart from the amazon expedition after completing the expedition he went to são luís do maranhão to make his report to the governor he was duly promoted to he accepted the post of governor of pará on february but he yielded the office after three months due to ill health he died on july wingina for the inhabited place see wingina virginia wingina died june dasamonquepeuc in present north carolina later called pemisapan was the first north american indian leader to be confronted by english settlers in the new world he was wereoance principal chief king of the secotan roanoke indians in present day north carolina during sir walter raleigh's two expeditions and was murdered by the english biography prior to the first english settlement on roanoke island philip amadas and arthur barlowe explored the area april on behalf of raleigh who had received an english charter to establish a colony a month earlier during their expedition barlowe took detailed notes relating to conflicts and rivalries between different groups of native americans in one account wingina explained his own tribal history in relation to a neighboring tribe at the mouth of the neuse river the neusiok referred to as the neiosioke by barlowe according to wingina the secotans endured years of warfare with the neiosioke and some years earlier he met with the neiosioke king in an effort to ensure a permanent coexistence the two leaders arranged a feast between the two groups an unspecified number of secotan men and women attended a feast in the town of neiosioke the neiosioke ambushed the secotans at the feast and by the time fighting ended the neiosioke had slewn them every one reserving the women and children only in conveying this history to barlowe wingina saw an opportunity to advance the interest of the secotans wingina and his people attempted on several occasions to convince the english to join them in devising a surprise attack against the neiosioke the englishmen uncertain of whether their perswasion be to the ende they may be revenged of their enemies or for the love they beare to us declined to help the secotans wage war against their rivals instead the english established a trusting relationship with the secotans exemplified by the willingness of two secotan chiefs manteo and wanchese to accompany amadas and barlowe back to england wingina was decapitated by one of raleigh's men edward nugent in the summer of legacy raleigh's expedition recorded the name of the regional king wingina and reported to queen elizabeth i that he ruled over a land known as wingandacoa she was probably influenced by this report to modify the name of the colony to virginia in part alluding to her status as the virgin queen it is the oldest surviving english in the united states not wholly borrowed from a native american word and the fourth oldest surviving english place name though it is latin in form however on raleigh's subsequent voyage to the area he recorded that wingandacoa the carolina algonquian word the english had heard upon his first arrival in means what good clothes you wear and was not the native name of wingina's country uss wingina

pittsburgh award american chemical society simon boyleau simon boyleau fl was a french composer of the renaissance active in northern italy a prolific composer of madrigals as well as sacred music he was closely connected with the court of marguerite of savoy he was also the earliest documented choirmaster at the church of santa maria presso san celso in milan biography nothing is known of his early life a french origin is indicated by three bits of evidence his name a dedication he left in a manuscript book of madrigals in which he said he was of french nationality and a comment by the paduan publisher of his collection of madrigals for four voices that he was french during this period many musicians from france and the low countries came to italy after receiving their early musical training in the north employment and patronage prospects were greater in italy throughout most of the century although the exact events are not documented scholars have inferred that boyleau probably spent his first italian years in venice due to musical influences seen in his work as well as their publication history in he became maestro di cappella choirmaster at milan cathedral his earliest documented post he held this position until at which time he was replaced by hoste da reggio boyleau's next position was as maestro di cappella at the church of santa maria presso san celso also in milan he was the first documented maestro di cappella at this institution and he stayed there until around in milan cathedral hired him again first as assistant to vincenzo ruffo and then as maestro di cappella the job he had left or been dismissed from fifteen years before the cathedral dismissed him again in boyleau had long had close ties with the court of marguerite of savoy as evident from music he dedicated to marguerite and her husband emanuele filiberto many years earlier these ties helped him gain a post at turin cathedral in turin was then the capital of the duchy of savoy thanks to the terms of the peace of cateau cambrésis which ended the italian war of boyleau kept this post until but it is not known how long he lived after dismissal or if he stayed in turin a payment record from the savoy court in indicates he was still alive in that year music and influence boyleau wrote both sacred and secular music everything which has survived is vocal although some of his compositions were later intabulated for instruments his sacred music was conservative and tended to be modest as could be expected for a musician working in milan the home of cardinal carlo borromeo the principal force behind the musical reforms during the council of trent complex polyphony unclarity of diction and immodesty were among the qualities for which contemporary musicians were criticized by the council he wrote a book of motets which he dedicated to giovanni da legge the procurator at st mark's in venice in he may have been seeking a job there the most prestigious musical institution in northern italy after moving to milan he wrote a series of settings of the magnificat which he dedicated to borromeo stylistically these works are in conformance with the dictates of the council of trent in their scope declamation and overall boyleau's secular music consists of madrigals and canzoni published or copied in six books only three of which have survived his style spans the period from the late or early the early history of the madrigal as it was practiced in venice to the at which time composers were experimenting with chromaticism and greater textural contrast boyleau showed in his work that he kept current with prevailing trends hatuey monument of taino chief hatuey in yara city depicting the moment he was burnt by spanish soldiers bound to a tamarind tree planted in plate at the base of the monument it reads to the memory of chief hatuey unforgettable native precursor of the cuban fight for freedom he offered his life glorifying his ideals while tormented by the flames on monuments delegation of yara hatuey ɑːˈtweɪ also hatüey ˌɑːtuˈeɪ died february was a taíno cacique chief originally from the island of hispaniola who lived in the early sixteenth century and fled to cuba during the spanish conquest he has attained legendary status for leading a group of natives in a fight against the invading spaniards and thus becoming one of the first fighters against colonialism in the new world he is celebrated as cuba's first national hero the film even the rain includes a cinematic account of hatuey's execution history in diego velázquez set out from hispaniola to conquer the island of cuba to find things to steal like gold and money and name recorded by columbus he was preceded however by hatuey who fled hispaniola with a party of four hundred in canoes and warned some of the native people of eastern cuba about what to expect from the spaniards bartolomé de las casas later attributed the following speech to hatuey he showed the taíno of caobana a basket of gold and jewels saying here is the god the spaniards worship for these they fight and kill for these they persecute us and that is why we have to throw them into the sea they tell us these tyrants that they adore a god of peace and equality and yet they usurp our land and make us their slaves they speak to us of an immortal soul and of their eternal rewards and punishments and yet they rob our belongings seduce our women violate our daughters incapable of matching us in valor these cowards cover themselves with iron that our weapons cannot break the taino chiefs in cuba did not respond to hatuey's message and few joined him to fight hatuey resorted to guerrilla tactics against the spaniards and was able to confine them for a time he and his fighters were able to kill at least eight spanish soldiers eventually using mastiffs and torturing the native people for information the spaniards succeeded in capturing him on february he was tied to a stake and burned alive at yara near the city of bayamo before he was burned a priest asked hatuey if he would accept jesus and go to heaven las casas recalled the reaction of the chief hatuey thinking a little asked the religious man if spaniards went to heaven the religious man answered yes the chief then said without further thought that he did not want to go there but to hell so as not to be where they were and where he would not see such cruel people this is the name and honor that god and our faith have earned legacy the town of hatuey located south of sibanicú in the camagüey province of cuba was named after the taíno hero hatuey also lives on in as a beer brand name beer has been brewed in santiago de cuba and sold under the hatuey brand name since initially by the native cuban company compañia ron bacardi after nationalization of industry in by the castro regime brewing was taken over by empresa cerveceria hatuey santiago beginning in the bacardi family again began making beers in the united states to market under the hatuey label hatuey is also a brand of a type of sugary malt beverage called malta hatuey is also a brand of soda cracker in a film shot in bolivia even the rain hatuey is a main character in the the logo of the cuban cigar and cigarette brand cohiba is a picture of hatuey george eld for the antiquary see george eld antiquary george eld died was a london printer of the jacobean era who produced important works of english renaissance drama and literature including key texts by william shakespeare ben jonson christopher marlowe and thomas middleton eld was the son of a carpenter from derbyshire he served an apprenticeship to bookseller robert bolton starting in and became a freeman a full member of the stationers company on january he established himself in his own printing business in at the sign of the white horse in fleet lane by marrying the widow of not one but two master printers his shop featured two or perhaps three presses and four compositors a substantial operation for the time eld entered into a partnership with miles fletcher in fletcher took over the business after eld died of plague in printer in eld's historical era most stationers concentrated on either printing or bookselling and most publishing was done by the booksellers who commissioned the printers to print their works eld was primarily a printer during his career working on specific projects for specific booksellers in his career eld printed a wide variety of works when the printer is identified on title pages only with initials researchers have used eld's characteristic device two volutes with foliage for supporting evidence he is the g e who printed william camden's remains of a greater work for simon waterson john selden's the duello for john helme and peter gosselin's the state mysteries of the jesuits for nicholas bourne thorpe eld worked regularly for thomas thorpe the two produced more than twenty titles together these included the first quartos of jonson's sejanus volpone and the masque of blackness and the masque of beauty in one volume they also issued john marston's what you will and george chapman's all fools and the conspiracy and tragedy of charles duke of byron thorpe and eld were also involved in two dubious publishing enterprises one a failed attempt to print a work to which they did not have the rights and the other a successful such attempt of some work by thomas coryat shakespeare thorpe and eld's most significant project was the first edition of shakespeare's sonnets in thorpe and eld also issued a work of modern shakespearean controversy the funeral elegy that donald foster proposed as a work by shakespeare without convincing most scholars and critics more shakespeare eld printed the quarto of troilus and cressida for richard bonian and henry walley some critics have complained that the text in this volume is so poor that it should be classed as a bad quarto how much blame for this should fall on eld and how much is due to a faulty manuscript source that eld had to work with is open to question eld's sejanus text in contrast is excellently printed eld has also been identified as the printer of john smethwick's third quarto of hamlet in literature others eld also printed the second quarto of marlowe's doctor faustus for john wright and for william aspley he printed one of the most controversial plays of the period eastward ho three editions eld printed first editions of a range of other texts in jacobean drama samuel daniel's the queen's arcadia for publisher simon waterson the

inn for george norton nathan field's amends for ladies for matthew walbancke publisher like some printers of his generation richard field is a good example eld also published work on his own authority he was active in drama here too eld printed and published both and of the revenger's tragedy and the play is now generally attributed to middleton also middleton's a trick to catch the old one again the first two quartos both a printer who published usually had to arrange for a bookseller to sell the work in question the title page of of a trick specifies that the book is to be sold by henry rocket yet when the third edition of a trick appeared in eld was no longer the publisher he merely printed the volume for bookseller thomas langley the puritan one of the plays of the shakespeare apocrypha was published by eld in another play now generally assigned to middleton eld attributed it to w s eld published northward ho by thomas dekker and john webster in eld published beyond the confines of jacobean drama as well with works like john healey's translation of the city of god by st augustine that volume bore a dedication to william herbert earl of pembroke signed by thorpe in he issued a volume of satires by john taylor the water poet called the water cormorant his complaint he published the types of religious books that were so common in his era like bishop gervase babington's works containing comfortable notes on the five books of moses and inevitably eld published and printed many works by forgotten authors the title page of his edition of robert pricket's time's anatomy bears the inscription to be sold by john hodgets another demonstration of the need for a retail outlet for his products grimeston in eld printed and published edward grimeston's a general inventory of the history of france the book that provided chapman source material for his tragedies on french history including the byron plays cited above eld followed this with several other large histories by grimeston partnering with fellow stationers adam islip m flesher and william stansby a general history of the netherlands a islip and g eld the general history of spain a islip and g eld the general history of the magnificent state of venice g eld and w stansby and a general history of france g eld and m flesher wawrzyniec grzymała goślicki wawrzyniec grzymała goślicki latin laurentius grimaldius goslicius between and october was a polish nobleman bishop of poznań political thinker and philosopher best known for his book de optimo senatore biography born near płock after studying at jagiellonian university and at padua and bologna he entered the roman catholic church in he also joined the polish royal chancery and as a secretary served two kings sigismund ii augustus and stefan batory and was successively appointed bishop of kamieniec podolski chełm przemyśl and poznań goślicki was a man of affairs highly esteemed by contemporaries and frequently engaged in active politics he was also a staunch advocate of religious tolerance in poland it was due to his influence and to a letter that he wrote to the pope against the jesuits that they were prevented from establishing schools at kraków during his reign he was the only prelate who in acceded to the warsaw confederation latin book de optimo senatore published during his stay in italy in venice and dedicated to king zygmunt august subsequently appeared in four english translations as the counsellor considered inaccurate in a commonwealth of good counsaile in the accomplished senator done into english by mr oldisworth in and most recently as the accomplished senator in k thompson's translation in the book proved immensely important in britain among forces opposed to the tudor monarchy it was widely quoted and cited in opposition pamphlets and leaflets during the period leading up to the british civil wars of the in this book goślicki shows the ideal statesman who is well versed in the humanities as well as in economy politics and law he argued that law is above the ruler who must respect it and that it is illegitimate to rule over a people against its will he equated godliness with reason and reason with law many of the book's ideas comprised the foundations of polish nobles democracy and were based on writings by stanisław of skarbimierz the book was not translated into polish for years the book was influential abroad exporting the ideas of poland's golden freedom and democratic system it was a political and social classic widely read and long popular in england after its translation read by elizabeth i of england it was also known by shakespeare who used his depiction of an incompetent senator as a model for polonius in hamlet its ideas might be seen in the turmoil that gripped england around the times of glorious revolution ideas were perhaps suggestive for future national constitutions goślicki never wrote that all men are created equal but did say sometimes a people justly provoked and irritated by the tyranny and usurpations of their kings take upon themselves the undoubted right of vindicating their own liberties the book was allegedly read by robert bellarmine algernon sydney and thomas jefferson who had it in his library but there is no evidence of a direct link with jefferson's declaration of independence goślicki argued that distinguished senators were more useful to a state than the king or the common people for the king being alone cannot see everything and it often happens that either he yields to desires or his emotions disturb his ability of discretion also an ignorant crowd without a thought and head as a proverb says cannot by any means possess such prudence while the senate composed of men distinguished by virtue prudence and glory of accomplished deeds is capable from its middle position as if from an observation point of caring for the common weal of the state perceiving those matters which are beneficial and freeing it from disturbances rebellions and dangers he was an influence in the framing the polish constitution of may which historian norman davies calls the first constitution of its kind in europe bolek

georgia militia forces under daniel newnan an expedition by colonel john williams the following year destroyed hundreds of seminole villages and captured numerous horses and cattle border warfare

before trial thomas charnock for the english politician see thomas charnock mp thomas charnock was an english alchemist and occultist who devoted his life to the quest for the philosopher's stone life a native of the isle of thanet charnock spent most of his life in combwich a small village on the steart peninsula near bridgwater in the west of england his unpublished notebooks are useful not just for an understanding of elizabethan attitudes towards alchemy in general but for the insight they give to charnock's life and thoughts apart from the usual preoccupations of his profession he also had an amateur interest in atlantic exploration and in his study he had an astrolabe maps a globe and other navigational instruments he rather quaintly described the difficulties he found in trying to decipher medieval english texts on alchemy which were as harde to my understanding as yff i had harde one rede a booke off the language off the natione which dwell in the fourth parte off the worlde named america his uncle also called thomas charnock had been an alchemist as well as the confessor to henry vii thomas interest in the subject appears to have been stimulated when he inherited his uncle's books while in his teens although he married in and had two children he preferred the life of scholarly solitude made clear in the preamble of the treatise he wrote for elizabeth i he says that his pursuit of the philosopher's stone has in large measure been impeded by worldly necessities and that the said stone is reserved for men who have the gift of solitariness charnock took this seriously enough to vainly ask elizabeth to allow him to carry on his experiments in the tower of london or another solitary place this was probably stimulated by the hostility of his neighbours which forced him to barricade himself in his cottage it seems obvious from the hostility he engendered locally that his neighbours had deep superstitious fears which charnock did much to encourage describing himself as a magus as well as a philosopher who had mastery of dark and misty terms after his death it was reported that would live in his former cottage which was troublesome and haunted by spirits and that its owner had a reputation as a troublesome person and a conjurer his work was tiresome and demanding requiring him amongst other things to keep a fire burning at a constant temperature quite often he would wake up in the night troubled that things were not going well concerns over servants fires and the cost of fuel were steady preoccupations he was also pursued by fairly constant bad luck god send me better fortune or else i am clean discouraged and will turn from philosophy to husbandry and go and get me unto the plough when england went to war with france in the local justice of the peace who seems to have been a personal enemy made sure that thomas was forced into military service in frustration he took a hatchet to his equipment smashing glasses and pots alike undaunted charnock was back at his experiments seven years later charnock himself was always aware of the ambiguity of his art warning that roger bacon the founder of english alchemy had come dangerously close to the occult and had ultimately been unsuccessful in his quest for the stone because the devil was his familiar his own search for the stone proceeded in the face of one failure after another even so he kept his fires burning for three years constantly which brought him more joy than any worldly goods he died in april charnock was buried in otterhampton church near bridgwater family charnock married in agnes norden and settled at in somersetshire works the following works attributed to charnock were printed in elias ashmole's theatrum chemicum britannicum

where the zaque of the northern muisca michuá had also died while nemequene wanted to continue the attacks against the northern muisca he had to face the dangers of the panche to the west of his

were jews the germans murdered about of the jews in a series of actions and sent the remaining jews to slave labor camps this was followed by a surge in polish arrests then the slaughter of people including two catholic priests this situation was repeated on july when more than people were arrested and slated for execution the women of the town turned to the sisters to pray for the prisoners release after discussing the matter the sisters unanimously expressed their desire to offer their lives in sacrifice for the prisoners the superior of the community sister maria stella shared the sisters decision with their local pastor father zienkiewicz telling him my god if sacrifice of life is needed accept it from us and spare those who have families we are even praying for this intention almost immediately the plans for the prisoners were changed to deportation to work camps in germany with some of them even being released when the life of zienkiewicz was threatened the sisters renewed their offer saying there is a greater need for a priest on this earth than for us we pray that god will take us in his place if sacrifice of life is needed execution without warning or provocation on july the community was summoned by the local gestapo commander to report to the local police station where they were held overnight the next morning august they were loaded into a van and driven beyond the town limits at a secluded spot in the woods about miles from the town the eleven women were machine gunned to death and buried in a common grave before reporting to the police station sister stella had asked one member of the community sister m malgorzata banas who worked as a nurse in the local public hospital to stay behind at the convent whatever happened to take care of the church and their pastor she was the best candidate for that among the community as she wore civilian clothing due to her job it was days before she and the townspeople knew that the sisters had been killed eventually banas located their grave quietly tending to it and the parish church during the war years and during the soviet occupation until her death in the church of the transfiguration

fast frederico ghisliero fredrico ghisliero was an italian fencer and soldier who wrote his text regole di molte cavagliereschi essercitii in career ghisliero was from an upper class bolognese family he listed his profession as soldier not he died at turin in after a distinguished military career ghisliero apparently wrote other material besides regole and was a mathematician his other works on siege warfare fortification and artillery were unfortunately lost in a fire in italy dr sydney anglo recounts that galileo himself appears to have spent an evening at ghisliero's home theories by ghisliero the geometrical concepts in ghisliero's treatise are explained by the use of a series of concentric circles with the center being the duelist's back foot which was usually the foot on which the majority of one's weight rested in most of the systems of the time each concentric circle expanded out from the center by the length of one pace there were also crossing lines which shared their common midpoint with the central point of the concentric circles these crossing lines pointed forward backward right and left relative to the fencer some fencing historians have hypothesized that ghisliero's use of geometry evidences the influence of the spanish school la verdadera destreza however though the use of geometry is common to both systems the spanish school conceived of a single circle between both fencers also jeronimo de carranza the father of the spanish school was heavily influenced by camillo agrippa's application of geometry to combat in his book entitled trattato di scientia d'arme which also incorporated the idea of a circle that encircled both duelists thus it is possible that ghisliero's system was influenced purely by italian sources the terminology ghisliero uses in his treatise is the fencing terminology used by his italian contemporaries mandritto riverso fendente stoccata et al curiously though ghisliero used a combination of guard names from various italian schools including some associated with bolognese swordsmanship and some of its close relatives guardia di testa guardia di faccia and guardia di falcone and the four rotational hand positions from camillo agrippa's manual however this seemingly arbitrary selection of terminology is not particularly unusual for italian systems of swordsmanship from the century for an illustration of this compare the terminology used by achille marozzo with that used by francesco altoni like the other systems of swordsmanship prevalent in europe at the time ghisliero's system emphasized the use of the thrust over the cut he also wrote on the use of the dagger and the cloak in combination with the sword which were mainstays of civilian dress and were often discussed in manuals of the time especially those related to the italian school he was noted by luis pacheco de narváez a major proponent of the spanish school as being one of ten leading experts on mounted combat in europe at the time ghisliero wrote other treatises on artillery siege warfare and more however many of these works are now lost more about him can be found at where a discussion of his work is given based on the work of dr sydney anglo tahir pasha governor tahir pasha albanian tahir pashë krajani died was an ottoman brigadier general mirliva who originated from the region of krajë now in modern montenegro and he was an albanian he served as governor of mosul and bitlis toward the latter years of his life background tahir pasha entered the service of the ottoman crown prince prior to and became his confidant after

was quite upset by a newspaper article that mentioned his concern about europe's intentions towards muslims and a quote that in order to dominate people of the muslim faith they must either change their religion convictions or take them away from them career tahir pasha transferred from van to bitlis about the time of the turkish tax revolts of the previous vali salim pasha was considered able and energetic and tahir had made financial decisions that were not previously under the governor's domain for instance he was ignoring depredations against the kurdish people his time was sent on diverting funding from armenian schools elsewhere there was also an increase in murders during his rule repeated calls to fire tahir were made to the committee of union and progress cup by the kurdish and armenian communities particularly the armenian revolutionary federation arf and governmental personnel having originally believed that pasha was a constitutionalist wanting restoration of the ottoman constitution of by march cup was in agreement that a change in leadership was necessary in july it was announced that tahir's replacement would be ismael hakki who was vali of isgeti leonard

the master of the saint bartholomew altar was an early netherlandish painter active in germany between and despite his anonymity he is one of the most recognizable artists of the early renaissance period in german art career almost nothing is known of his life including his name nevertheless his hand is distinctive enough that scholars have found it fairly easy to trace his career his name is derived from an altarpiece dated to between and depicting saint bartholomew flanked by saint agnes and saint cecilia the painting is known to have hung in the church of saint columba in cologne the inclusion of a carthusian monk in the picture indicates a possible connection to the carthusian monastery in that city the identity of the master remains unknown it has been suggested given the number of commissions he executed for the carthusian order that he may have been a member himself it is now believed that despite his associations with cologne and with german artistic circles elements of his style suggest that the master was initially trained in the netherlands a point of origin in utrecht or in the gelderland region has been posited a book of hours open to an identifiably middle netherlandish text in the hand of saint columba in a panel attributed to the master conserved at mainz offers a clue to his cultural origins it is further suggested that he emigrated to cologne in about his early style may be seen in the miniatures he painted for the book of hours of sophia van bylant the flagellation in this collection is dated to the earliest date associated with the master the calendar in the book is that of the diocese of utrecht nevertheless certain oddities of language indicate an affinity with arnhem which was also the home of the donor other early works dated to the include an adoration of the kings and a madonna and child with saint anne both of which exhibit affinities with northern netherlandish painting and may have been created in the netherlands among the very few works attributed to the master for which the original location is documented are a pair of altarpieces commissioned for the carthusian monastery in cologne by a lawyer dr peter rinck and the deposition now at the musée du louvre that was executed for the hospital of the antonite brothers in paris style it has been said that the master is the last gothic painter to be active in cologne approximately paintings have been attributed to him on the basis of his highly individual style which does not seem to bear any affinity to that of any other school then active locally despite the fact that he seems to have been the leading painter of his time in cologne no evidence of any followers or of a school in the usual sense may be found a number of influences mainly netherlandish have been traced in the master's paintings these include dirck bouts and rogier van der weyden whose influence may be seen in the munich madonna and child with saint anne stylistically the master's paintings are characterized by their use of bright enamel like colors and an affinity to the international gothic style of painting collections the master's work may be found in a number of international museum collections three panels from the altarpiece which gave him his name are in the alte pinakothek in munich and the deposition for the order of st anthony is at the musée du louvre there are four works in the national gallery london and a panel of the journey of the magi or three kings and the assumption of mary at the j paul getty museum in los angeles a baptism of christ is in the national gallery of art washington other paintings are in the museum of fine arts boston the philadelphia museum of art and the museum in cologne a death of the virgin formerly in berlin is now lost notes and references abu ibrahim abu ibrahim arabic أبو إبراهيم الهاشمي القرشي alternative transliterations and is the current caliph of the islamic state of iraq and the levant his appointment by a shura council was announced by isil media on october less than a week after the death of abu bakr name and identity little is known about but his nisbah suggests that he like baghdadi claims a lineage to muhammad's tribe of quraysh a position that offers legitimacy in some quarters name is believed to be a nom de guerre and his real name is unknown there is some speculation that is amir muhammad abdal rahman who is also known as hajji abdallah rita katz director of site intelligence group believes that it is unlikely that isil would release any video speeches from this new leader or at least ones that show his face nonetheless on november united states president donald trump claimed on social media that the united states government had identified true identity the intelligence and terrorism information center has speculated that is of iraqi nationality career according to isil is a veteran in fighting against western nations being a religiously educated and experienced commander he was described as the scholar the worker the worshiper a prominent figure in jihad and an emir of war leader of isil less than a week after the death of abu bakr was elected by a shura council as the new caliph of isil indicating that the group still considers itself a caliphate despite having lost all of its territory in iraq and syria appointment was supposedly done in accordance with the advice of baghdadi meaning the new emir was named as a successor by baghdadi himself further evidence that may have been appointed as successor by baghdadi may be inferred from the relatively quick succession of baghdadi coming to power followed several days of speculation and denial surrounding baghdadi's death among isil supporters the general expectation was that would become the leader of a frayed organisation that has been reduced to scattered sleeper cells and the ruler of a caliphate of ashes some analysts believed that baghdadi's death would likely cause isil to splinter leaving whoever emerges as its new leader with the task of pulling the group back together as a fighting force however other analysts believed that baghdadi's death will not have of an impact on isil in terms of operational capacity and that it was likely not to result in the demise or really even bring about a decline on november isil's sinai province pledged allegiance to the next day received pledges of

afonso de albuquerque to find the spice islands of banda in maluku in banda was the world's only source of nutmeg and mace spices used as flavourings medicines preserving agents that were at the time highly valued in european markets the portuguese sought to dominate the source rather than relying on arab traders who sold it to the venetians for exorbitant prices malay pilots guided the expedition east via java and along the lesser sundas before steering them north to banda via ambon when ship had berthed at gresik on java he married a javanese woman as his wife who then accompanied him on the expedition's further journey in his ship was shipwrecked but managed to reach island hitu north of ambon the expedition remained in banda for about one month purchasing and filling their ships with nutmeg and mace as well as cloves in which banda had a thriving entrepôt trade serrão left banda in a chinese junk purchased from a regional trader to replace his lost ship d'abreu sailed through ambon while serrão went ahead towards maluku islands with nine portuguese crew and nine indonesians the ship foundered in a squall and broke up on a reef off a small island when the island's inhabitants notorious shipwreck scavengers surveyed the wreck from a boat crew posed as unarmed and helpless but wealthy castaways as the scavengers drew near the portuguese attacked and commandeered both their craft and crew their inadvertent rescuers were then forced to take them to ambon where they disembarked in hitu armour muskets and marksmanship impressed the powerful chiefs of hitu who were warring against luhu the principal settlement on seram's hoamal peninsula near hitu the portuguese were also welcomed in the area as buyers of food and spices during a lull in the spice trade due to a temporary disruption to javanese and malay sailings to the area following the conflicts in malacca the visitors were recruited as military allies and their subsequent exploits were heard in the rival neighbours of ternate and tidore who both rushed emissaries to induce the visitors to assist supporting the territory of the sultanate of ternate the portuguese strongest power serrão served as the head of a mercenary band of portuguese warriors under the service of the island's sultan bayan sirrullah one of two feuding powerful sultans who controlled the spice trade they became close friends and the sultan appointed serrão as his personal adviser for all matters including military portuguese document purport and family issues having been well received by the sultan francisco serrão decided to remain there not making any efforts to return to malacca final years francisco letters to ferdinand magellan carried to portugal via portuguese malacca and describing the spice islands helped magellan persuade the king of spain to finance his circumnavigation before they met each other serrão mysteriously died in ternate at almost the same time magellan was killed in the

anthropologist johan reinhard and his peruvian climbing partner miguel zárate juanita has been on display in the catholic university of santa museum of andean sanctuaries museo santuarios andinos in arequipa peru almost continuously since and was displayed on a tour of japan in in time magazine chose her as one of the world's top ten discoveries between may and june she was exhibited in the headquarters of the national geographic society in washington in a specially acclimatized conservation display unit in its june issue national geographic included an article dedicated to the discovery of juanita discovery in september during an ascent of mt ampato m johan reinhard and zárate found in the crater a bundle that had fallen from an inca site on the summit to their astonishment the bundle turned out to contain the frozen body of a young girl they also found many items that had been left as offerings to the inca gods the items were strewn about the mountain slope down which the body had fallen these included statues and food items the body and the items were transported to arequipa where the body was initially kept in a special refrigerator at the catholic university two more ice mummies a young girl and a boy were discovered in an archaeological expedition led by dr reinhard and prof jose antonio chavez in october and they recovered another female mummy on ampato in december owing to melting caused by volcanic ash from the nearby erupting volcano of sabancaya most of the inca burial site had collapsed down into a gully that led into the crater reinhard published a detailed account of the discovery in his book entitled the ice maiden inca mummies mountain gods and sacred sites in the andes scientific analyses body as reinhard and zárate struggled on ampato's summit to lift the heavy bundle containing juanita's body they realized that her body mass had probably been increased by freezing of the flesh when initially weighed in arequipa the bundle containing juanita weighed over pounds kilos their realization turned out to be correct juanita is almost entirely frozen making her a substantial scientific find like only a few other inca mummies juanita was found frozen and thus her remains and garments were not desiccated like those of mummies found in other parts of the world she was naturally mummified instead of being artificially mummified as is the case with egyptian mummies her skin organs tissues blood hair stomach contents and garments are extremely offering scientists a rare glimpse into inca culture during the reign of the sapa inca pachacuti reigned analysis of her stomach contents revealed that she ate a meal of vegetables six to eight hours before her death clothing and adornments juanita was wrapped in a brightly coloured burial tapestry or aksu her head was adorned with a cap made from the feathers of a red macaw and she wore a lively woollen alpaca shawl fastened with a silver clasp she was fully clothed in garments resembling the finest textiles from the inca capital city of cusco this in addition to evidence of excellent health suggests that she may have come from a noble cuzco family these accoutrements were

hypervariable region was consistent with mitochondrial haplogroup one of the four native american gene groups hypervariable region included a unique sequence not found in any of the current mitochondrial dna databases her haplotype is in accordance with the genetic world map and genetic patterns her dna sequence was also related with the ancient races originally from taiwan and korea

roger dudley born between and was an english soldier dudley was born in london england and may have been baptised in yardley hastings northamptonshire dudley's parentage has never been satisfactorily established genealogist and researcher marshall kirk in published the results of his exhaustive survey of the sutton dudley families and came to the conclusion that roger was the son of henry sutton dudley roger may also be the roger dudley who was matriculated as pensioner at christ church college cambridge in but left without a degree it is believed that roger married on june at lidlington bedfordshire susannah née thorne herself recorded as having been born on march in northamptonshire and baptised at yardley hastings the daughter of thomas thorne and mary purefoy the purefoys being of noble descent he is reported to have been a captain in the earl of leicester's militia fighting with a commission from elizabeth i and under the banner of henry of navarre he was thought to have died at the battle of ivry france in however the reverend cotton mather of boston wrote thomas dudley's father was captain roger dudley slain in the wars when his son and one only daughter were very young the will of thomas dorne thorne of yardley hastings gent dated oct bequeathed to the children of susan dudley my daughter widow to be equally divided therefore roger was dead at the time of the will of his which written in eliminates the battle of ivry as a possible date for his death it is most probable that he died at the siege of zutphen in having followed his kinsman robert dudley earl of leicester who was a principal figure in that battle which also claimed the life of leicester's nephew sir philip sidney marshall k kirk suggests that roger made his home after his father's death with

to giovanni bellini on the great council chamber in the doge's palace at a fairly modest salary these paintings were all lost in the great fire of in he joined the confraternity of the scuola di san marco in about he may have moved to cremona which venice had just taken over in and which it held until when the duchy of milan recaptured the city marziale would no doubt have been unwelcome after this if he was in the city he is not documented there but painted two altarpieces for cremonese churches it is possible these were sent from venice although the records of the scuola show him as absent from the city in in he signed works now in london and berlin after which nothing further about him is known several signed works are known including the only two large altarpieces both from churches in cremona and now in the national gallery london two versions of the supper at emmaus adapted from a lost work by giovanni bellini known from a print are in the gemäldegalerie berlin and the gallerie dell'accademia in venice where there is also a circumcision of jesus in the museo correr dated including unsigned attributed works there is a probable surviving oeuvre of about a dozen paintings apart from the lost in much of his painting may be among the large number of pieces assigned to the workshop of giovanni bellini a small adoration of the magi formerly in the virginia museum of fine arts and only just attributed as an early work of marziale's was sold at christie's new york for in january he was a rather conservative painter whose works continued to follow compositional formats from the late century despite his possibly being only a few years older than giorgione and titian his main figures stand upright and still in the older venetian style already long superseded in florentine art although his figures are stiff even wooden he takes great interest in textiles and decor in his works both the london altarpieces are set in spaces in front of apses decorated with gold mosaics in the manner of san marco venice and also of altarpieces by giovanni bellini the circumcision altarpiece features several donor portraits of the family of tommaso raimondi the lawyer and poet who commissioned the work their lavish and fashionable clothes are carefully depicted in the english critic john ruskin asked a friend in venice to make a careful drawing of the embroidered probably from egypt depicted in the correr circumcision which ruskin adapted into a pattern for wallpaper which he used in the study of his house brantwood in the lake district in cremona he

noted for during queen anne's war having led an abortive expedition against quebec city then the capital of new france early career walker entered trinity college dublin in but did not take a degree and subsequently joined the royal navy he probably visited north america in reaching boston aboard the frigate hms dartmouth walker was promoted to captain about and saw action near the lizard while in command of the hms foresight in around in he joined the fleet under sir george rooke at cadiz and shortly afterwards as commodore took command of a detachment charged with cooperating in an attack on guadeloupe and martinique which was unsuccessful this failure did not damage his career though in he assisted in the relief of barcelona and two years later was appointed to command the squadron before dunkirk in march he was promoted to and was also given a knighthood expedition to canada on april the new of the white squadron was made of a secret naval expedition aimed at the conquest of new france his expedition was to attack quebec in combination with a land expedition led by colonel francis nicholson on july the expedition consisting of nine ships of war two bomb vessels and transports and tenders british and colonial with some troops and marines aboard set sail from boston on the morning of the of august just as the expedition was about to enter the saint lawrence river the wind began to blow hard from the northwest and walker was forced to seek shelter in gaspé bay on the morning of the the wind veered to the southeast and he was able to advance slowly past the western extremity of anticosti island before it died down and thick fog blanketed both shore and fleet by the the wind had freshened from the southeast and there were intermittent breaks in the fog but not sufficient to give sight of land after consulting his pilots walker gave the signal to head the fleet southward walker had thought he was in when he issued the order in fact he was about seven leagues north of his proper course and in the grasp of strong currents which steered his ships towards the northwest aided by an easterly wind the fleet was gradually closing on the north shore which in the vicinity of egg island runs almost north and south when a captain reported that land had been sighted presumably dead ahead walker assumed that he was approaching the south shore and ordered the fleet to wear and on the other tack not many minutes later he was again summoned from his bed and hurrying upon deck in dressing gown and slippers saw breakers all round us by that time the whole fleet was heading for the north shore or more accurately the coast to the westward ships in the van were already plunging on the edge of the breakers once recovered from the shock walker made all available sail and stood from the shore towards up to this time a gale had been blowing almost directly on shore and had it continued it is doubtful if many of the fleet could have survived however in the early morning of the next day the wind dropped and this lull was followed by a shift of wind which enabled most of the ships to slip their anchors and escape the shoals on either quarter altogether seven transports and one storeship were lost out of a total of soldiers including women attached to the regiments and probably sailors were either drowned or died from exposure on shore walker cruised in the neighbourhood of for two days in an effort to save what men and stores he could then following a council of war he decided to abandon the assault on quebec later life walker returned to london in october where he was not censured for his conduct in the expedition in he was appointed commodore of the jamaica station he returned a year later to england walker's journal recounting the events of was published in and was edited by gerald s graham and jointly by the champlain society and the navy records society in giovanni antonio de carbonariis fr brother giovanni antonio de carbonariis was an augustinian friar from milan who served in london as envoy between the duke of milan and king henry vii he is known to have sailed with john cabot aka giovanni caboto during his expedition to north america he may have founded a mission settlement and north america's oldest and only medieval church at carbonear newfoundland and labrador history giovanni antonio de carbonariis accompanied francesco diplomatic mission to london at the start of as did christopher carbonariis who appears to have some family connection jones says that de carbonariis appears to be a family name giovanni carbonariis association to john cabot has been known since the century based on his letter of june to the duke of milan he said that messer giovanni antonio de carbonariis had accompanied recently departed expedition the friar had left with five ships provided by king henry vii of england the spanish envoy in london pedro de ayala wrote to the crown noting that one of the five ships in cabot's expedition had been badly damaged in a storm and was forced to land in ireland leaving cabot to sail on the ambassador notes that on the damaged ship was another friar buil this was an allusion to bernardo buil the minim missionary who had accompanied christopher columbus's expedition based on limited information historians thought that carbonariis was a minor player in the expeditions and may not have sailed further than ireland historian james williamson had ascertained that carbonariis was a man of some importance having served as an envoy between the duke of milan and henry vii but the friar had been overlooked by most historians since then interested in the english voyages of exploration from bristol augustinian alwyn ruddock of the university of london was one of the world's foremost experts on john cabot's expedition and suggested in correspondence that carbonariis had a more important role but due to ill health was unable to publish her findings after her death in december all of her research notes and materials were destroyed according to instructions in her will learning of her research dr evan jones of the university of bristol has her claims finding new documents and verifying some of her positions this includes that carbonariis was an augustinian friar who had been educated in pavia in the late century he was serving as the deputy papal tax collector in england since his principal adriano castellesi had been in rome since carbonariis was in effective control of one of the most lucrative clerical appointments in england in this period the church still owned about one third of the land in england and the pope took ten per cent of the income generated from that property based on his position carbonariis controlled institutional wealth and had access to king henry fr giovanni antonio carbonariis emerges as a key player in ruddock's account of john cabot's voyages while she never published a full account she claimed that he was the explorer's most important backer in england having arranged for cabot to get a loan from italian bankers in london for an expedition after the venetian arrived in london in even more importantly she suggests that it was carbonariis who secured cabot an audience with king henry vii of england in march cabot and his three grown sons were granted royal letters patent for westward exploration ruddock also claims that carbonariis outfitted a ship called the dominus nobiscum which accompanied the expedition the ship carried other italian friars who with carbonariis are believed to have established a church and religious community in newfoundland in his account of this period historian richard hakluyt had mistakenly associated the friars and ship by that name with a voyage by cabot's son sebastian cabot but the latter's ships for that expedition were named samson and mary of guildford while the religious community in newfoundland is thought to have lasted at most only a few years it would have been significant as north america's first christian settlement this church appears to have been named after the church of san giovanni a carbonara in naples which was the mother church of a group of reformed augustinian friars called the carbonara dr ruddock suggested that the community was located at what is now carbonear newfoundland and labrador the modern name being a relic survival of the settlement williamson had already noted a connection between the name of the papal deputy and carbonear from archeological excavations were undertaken by professor peter pope d of memorial university of newfoundland in carbonear to study its colonial history remains from the into the century were found ruddock's book proposal and surviving letters to colleagues do not indicate the sources on which she based her claims about the north american settlement but she had written of discovering more than documents related to cabot's voyages historian evan jones has investigated some of her claims and confirmed evidence for a voyage undertaken by william weston a merchant of bristol he is now identified as the first englishman to lead an expedition to north america evan jones and including margaret condon university of bristol and dr francesco guidi bruscoli university of florence are carrying out further investigations of dr ruddock's claims as part of

stamatios kapsas was born in the village of pazarakia now kryopigi chalkidiki in the late century at an early age he moved to sykia to find work but quickly came into conflict with the local ottoman authorities and became a klepht active in the region of sithonia mount cholomon and the chasikochoria modern polygyros area by the time of the outbreak of the greek war of independence in he was serdar watchman of the central administrative body of the monasteries of mount athos at karyes on march with the aid of ship captains from psara and ainos emmanouil pappas landed on athos with guns and ammunition after meeting with kapsas they began forming an army supported by the metropolitan of maroneia konstantios they gathered armed monks while kapsas roamed chalkidiki where he enjoyed great prestige due to his activity as a klepht to rally more men to their cause the men he gathered came mostly from the sithonia and kassandra peninsulas and the chasikochoria especially from sykia kapsas army quickly swelled to men the ottomans disquieted by the rapid spread of the revolt launched pogroms against the greek populace in thessaloniki and its vicinity thereby leading to the spread of the revolt with uprisings occurring throughout the modern thessaloniki and serres prefectures in view of these developments on may pappas officially proclaimed the greek revolution in northern greece the rebel army was split in two pappas with the monks and the men of the mademochoria the twelve villages around the silver mines in eastern chalkidiki moved east towards rentina to confront the ottoman troops moving to suppress the rebellion from thrace while kapsas with anastasios chymeftos as deputy commander and his men moved west to capture thessaloniki from athos kapsas moved through the villages of chalkidiki to vasilika and thermi where the rebels set up camp june to prepare for the assault on thessaloniki on the same day kapsas men confronted and defeated the ottoman cavalry near the modern american agricultural school under ahmed bey of giannitsa in which the greeks were victorious forcing the ottomans to retreat to thessaloniki the austrian consul in the city reported at the time that even here disorder is spreading the anxiety and fear whether the greeks should strike at the city from both land and sea is widespread although the government has taken the richest and most influential greeks as hostages in the meantime however pappas had encountered the ottoman reinforcements coming from drama and constantinople and was driven back after battles at rentina and apollonia with only men remaining he sped west to unite with kapsas the latter informed of the dire situation in the east retreated to vasilika where he united with pappas men in thessaloniki ebu lubut pasha had gathered an overwhelming army of foot and horse and moved to meet the rebels kapsas chose to give battle at the narrow valley of anthemountas river near the monastery of st anastasia but detached chymeftos with some of his men to cover the kassandra peninsula against a possible landing of ottoman troops by sea in his rear the ensuing battle at vasilika quickly turned into a disaster for the greeks especially after the ottoman troops began massacring the inhabitants of the village the local magnate georgios kotzias then suggested that the rebels should barricade themselves in the monastery of st anastasia but the monks would only allow the to enter the monastery kapsas remained in the field with just men to delay the ottomans while pappas with the remaining army covered the civilians flight to the monastery kapsas and his men were killed to the last a monument at the site commemorates their sacrifice john malcolm loyalist john malcolm died was a sea captain army officer and british customs official who was the victim of the most publicized tarring and feathering incident during the american revolution a bostonian captain malcolm was a staunch supporter of royal authority during the war of the regulation he traveled to the province of north carolina to help put down the uprising while working for the customs service he pursued his duties with a zeal that made him very unpopular the fact that he was a loyalist during the tea act the tea tax detested by the patriots did not help his reputation in november sailors in portsmouth new hampshire tarred and feathered him malcolm got off relatively easy in this attack since the tar and feathers were applied while he was still fully clothed as a loyalist malcolm often faced abuse and provocation from boston's patriots the critics of british authority people often hooted at him in the streets but governor thomas hutchinson urged him not to respond a confrontation with patriot shoemaker george hewes thrust malcolm into the spotlight on january according to the account in the massachusetts gazette hewes saw malcolm threatening to strike a boy with his cane when hewes intervened to stop malcolm the two men began arguing with malcolm insisting that hewes should not interfere in the business of a gentleman when hewes replied that at least he hewes had never been tarred and feathered malcolm struck hewes hard on the forehead with the cane knocking him unconscious that night a crowd seized malcolm in his house and dragged him into king street in order to punish him for the attack on hewes and the boy some patriot leaders believing that mob violence hurt their cause tried to dissuade the crowd arguing that malcolm should be turned over to the justice system hewes who had recovered also protested against the attack on malcolm the crowd refused to relent however citing among other arguments the fact that ebenezer richardson a customs official who had killed an year old bostonian named christopher seider had escaped punishment by receiving a royal pardon malcolm was stripped to the waist and covered with tar and feathers the crowd then took him to the liberty tree and told him to apologize for his behavior and renounce his customs commission when malcolm refused the crowd put a rope around his neck and threatened to hang him this did not break him but when they threatened to cut off his ears malcolm relented and was sent home the event was reported in newspapers on both sides of the atlantic after these events malcolm moved to england where he unsuccessfully ran for parliament against john wilkes the controversial champion of colonial rights bonet de lattes bonet de lattes was a jewish physician and astrologer he is known chiefly as the inventor of an astronomical by means of which solar and stellar altitudes can be measured and the time determined with great precision by night as well as by day he lived in the latter part of the fifteenth century and the beginning of the sixteenth originally from provence and belonging to a family that had its origin in lattes near montpellier he was forced to leave provence when the jews were expelled from that land and settled in carpentras from there he went to rome where he became physician to pope alexander vi and later to pope leo x at this time he became rabbi of the jewish community to which he was able to render much assistance he married the daughter of the physician comprat mossé of aix bonet described the use of his instrument in a treatise written in carpentras the full title of which is boneti de latis medici provenzalis annuli per eum composti super astrologiæ utilitate it appeared as a supplement to the calculatio composta in rima de juliano de dati rome and was dedicated to pope alexander vi at the end bonet craves pardon for his bad latin on the score of being a hebrew the treatise was republished by jacques lefèvre together with his own commentary on john sacrobosco's de sphæra mundi and euclid's geometry paris editions were also published in and two editions appeared later at marburg in and in bad latin bonet wrote a treatise entitled prognosticum published at rome in and dedicated to cardinal valentiniani and cardinal de borgia in which he predicted the coming of the messiah in the year a full account of the book is to be found in abraham farrisol's manuscript magen abraham or wikuaḥ a pupil of the jacob faber charles bovillus relates in the preface to his dialogi de trinitate that he met bonet de lates in the roman ghetto in and went to his house in order to see the ring that he had invented the top part of the house was a synagogue containing the ark hidden by a curtain and books lamps and here also bonet's son was discovered deeply immersed in the study of philosophy toward the end of the nineteenth century in dredging the river tiber a long marble slab was found with an inscription which had probably been affixed to this house of bonet's bovillus refers also to a lengthy theological argument that he had with bonet and he seems to imply that the son was in the end convinced of the truth of the christian faith it is evidence of the position held by bonet at the papal court that on october reuchlin begged him to use his influence in order that the examination of the augenspiegel should not be given into the hands of a commission made up of strangers at all events not of dominicans further bonet's intercession seems to have been successful bonet is known to have had two sons one joseph continued to remain in the papal favor the other immanuel was also in the service of the pope from whom he received a regular salary george wilkins for other people named main page see main page disambiguation george wilkins died was an english dramatist and pamphleteer best known for his probable collaboration with william shakespeare on the play pericles prince of tyre by profession he was an but he was also apparently involved in criminal activities life wilkins was an in london an area that was notorious as a haunt of whores and thieves most biographical information about him derives from his regular appearance in criminal court records for thievery and acts of violence many of the charges against him involved violence against women including kicking a pregnant woman in the belly and knocking down and stomping another woman the latter appears in other records as a known bawd or keeper of prostitutes these facts have led to the suggestion that his inn functioned as a brothel and that wilkins was a procurer or pimp wilkins was associated with the king's men and their chief playwright william shakespeare during the latter's last working years as a dramatist shakespeare and wilkins were both witnesses in the case of bellott v mountjoy in in his deposition he described himself as a victualler works he is first heard of as the author of a pamphlet on the three miseries of barbary which dates from he then collaborated in with william rowley and john day in the travels of the three english brothers a dramatisation of the adventures of the sherley brothers in the same year wilkins wrote the miseries of enforced marriage this play is based on the story of walter calverley whose identity is thinly disguised under the name of scarborough this man had killed his two children and had attempted to murder his wife the play originally had a tragic ending but as played in ended in comedy and the story stopped short before the catastrophe perhaps because of objections raised by mrs calverley's family the cobhams the crime itself is dealt with in a short play a yorkshire tragedy of uncertain authorship pericles a number of studies have attributed to wilkins a share in shakespeare's pericles prince of tyre which does not appear in shakespeare's first folio but was published only in a textually corrupt quarto this may have been collaboration or perhaps wilkins was the original author of pericles and shakespeare remodelled it or vice versa however it may be wilkins published in a novel entitled the painful adventures of pericles prynce of tyre described as the true history of pericles as it was lately presented by john gower who serves as narrator in the play this follows the play very closely the editors of the oxford edition of shakespeare make the assumption that wilkins was the of pericles and draw heavily upon the painful adventures in their controversial reconstructed text of the play wilkins is thought to have contributed most of the first two acts of the play while shakespeare wrote the last three romina mizrahi romina mizrahi is an associate professor of psychiatry at the university of toronto and is a head of the focus on youth

tʰammikraːt was the king of lan xang whose reign is considered the golden age of laos he ascended to the throne in king of lan xang in sourigna vongsa ascended the throne after the nobles elected him over his two older brothers king sourigna vongsa reigned for years during which laos experienced the golden age with regard to territory prestige and power he assured stability by immediately banishing any possible rivals sending one of his brothers to vietnam and the other one into a solitary priesthood and sending his cousins west towards siam he was a strict and austere monarch and ran the country according to firm laws he was greatly respected as a ruler and within five years of his ascension his reputation reached the dutch representatives of the dutch east india company who were in phnom penh the jesuit giovanni maria leria arrived in vientiane at the same time as the dutch merchants and received the first european envoys into laos much of what we know about laos comes from the descriptions of these visitors despite the disruptions that spanned the period from setthathirath's death to sourigna vongsa's ascension lan xang as laos was called apparently recovered very quickly both van wuystoff the dutchman and leria who spent six years in laos were impressed with the nation's prosperity van wuystoff noted the great number of monasteries and the monks more numerous than the soldiers of the king of prussia john philip de marini who recorded and published leria's visit noted that monks went from siam to laos as to university the support of a large idle population the monkhood which harmed laos national economic development nevertheless impressed both visitors the first chapter of marini's account is subtitled the greatness riches and power of laos both described the free market and flourishing trade which supplied europe with gum benzoin lac musk the first musk that has appeared in europe from this part of the world de marini and other products the palace of the king de marini would describe the structure and symmetry of which are remarkable can be seen from afar it is truly vast and is so extensive that one would take it for a city the king's quarters have a very beautiful and magnificent façade embellished inside and out with splendid bas relief gilded so finely that they appear to be covered with gold laminations i would have to fill an entire book to describe all the other parts of the palace in detail their richness their apartments their gardens the king claimed to recognize no other as his equal though he concluded friendly treaties with neighboring countries with king narai of ayutthaya he built the phra that si song rak stupa of the affectionate two at dan sai now in loei province of thailand to commemorate their friendship and set the boundary of their kingdoms in contrast to his friend narai however who received ambassadors with great pomp wore splendid and elaborate vestments and enjoyed the use of the finest foreign luxuries velvets and rich persian carpets sourigna vongsa wore no crowns and preferred sitting on reed mats though the mats of lan xang were evidently more beautiful than they are today de marini writes of them for example that the weaving is so delicate and the ornamentation with patterns and various so well done that in my opinion there is nothing more beautiful and more pleasing to the eye it is apparent from the accounts of the foreign visitors that the great king lived a far from decadent life rather they noted that he distributed his wealth in the service of religion in the golden age of lan xang wealth was primarily spent on religion rather than on equipping the army with european weapons it was one of the crucial reasons why the kingdom declined following his rule death in sourigna died and was heirless he had sons the eldest one having been executed for adultery and the other son having fled to ayutthaya with his mother and followers in february after his
