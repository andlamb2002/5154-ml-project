was appointed chief constable and set the strategic direction for the force within the police and crime plan later in january he published his vision for the force preventing crime protecting the public and helping those in need david thompson said more people ask for help from the police because cuts across public services generally mean more vulnerable people were involved with the police thompson maintains west midlands police does not always have the resources to provide the service the public wants and expects due to budget cuts and cuts in the number of police officers also due to increase in crime including modern slavery and gang crime thompson said the level of calls we're receiving this summer summer are very challenging and sometimes that service that we're providing at those peak times doesn't meet what the public expect i get that sometimes that service will be a poor service sometimes actually the service is what we can and say we will offer and sometimes that might not always be what the public want to see thompson also wrote the government has had a partial view of policing in the last few years it was very interested in terrorism and threats but less focused on local crimes which had been left for forces and police and crime commissioners to manage amid steep budget cuts this more local agenda has many positives in setting priorities but it has come with steep budget reductions and a widening mission there has been a reduction of police budgets of since but ranging between across forces crime is rising and so is the demand on our service the calls do not get answered as quickly as they did officers are not as fast at responding to emergencies and more crimes are dealt with on the phone fewer crimes like thefts are investigated and as a result fewer offenders brought to justice the visibility and proactivity of neighbourhood policing is much reduced the nao national audit office assesses the government did not fully understand the actual impact of these cuts on police forces policing is at the tipping point and we need to move on from here awards thompson was awarded the qpm in personal life he graduated in law from liverpool

ben jacob hakohen malachi ben jacob also known as the yad malachi was a renowned talmudist methodologist and one of the greatest kaballists of the century he was a student of the famous kabbalist rabbi joseph ergas author of the original kabbalistic text known as shomer emunim born in livorno sometime between and he passed on in the year and is considered the last of the great rabbinical authorities of italy praised effusively by his contemporaries and quoted frequently by major halakhic authorities of the and centuries he served as rabbi of livorno italy and apparently lived to an old age a decision by him dated nisan and referring to a civil case at rome is included in the responsa of rabbi isaiah bassani of reggio todat shelamim no during the controversy between jonathan eybeschutz and jacob emden he sided with the former letter of the rabbinate of leghorn in luḥot edut he is most famous for his yad mal'aki a methodological work and compilation in three parts part one contains an alphabetical list of all the rules and technical terms found in the talmud with explanations part two deals with rules regarding the codifiers part three deals with the rules relating to legal decisions explaining certain general principles of legal responsa malachi wrote also a liturgical work shibḥe todah containing prayers for the of shebaṭ a instituted by the community of leghorn in addition to these malachi also wrote a sefer torah in his own hand which then became an authoritative reference for many details regarding the correct formation of various hebrew letters yad malachi his major work the yad malachi first printed in livorno and later berlin was praised by his contemporaries as well as halakhic authorities of later generations rabbi yitzchak shmelkes wrote that every reader of this book will be amazed by the way this living lion the high priest dives in the mighty waters the sea of the talmud no secret is hidden from him while rabbi chaim joseph david azulai the chida wrote and after much time the sun shone upon the land with the precious book yad malachi and as the eyes of servants to the hand of their masters i have raised my eyes and seen the yad malachi was printed again in the late century and a new edition with greatly improved fonts format and biographical detail was printed in israel in in machon yerushalayim published a critical

generation descendant of zhu quan the seventeenth son of the hongwu emperor he attempted to usurp the throne and was the leader of the prince of ning rebellion biography zhu chenhao was not a military man but had literary talents and was a pleasure seeker however he was cunning and ambitious like almost all other princes aiming to become emperor zhu chenhao succeeded to the title prince of ning in from his father zhu jinjun in hongzhi's era the title was hereditary from their ancestor zhu quan the first prince of ning zhu chenhao lived in jiangxi province far away from the ming capital treason main article prince of ning rebellion zhu chenhao had long intended to rebel but he did not have an army or even bodyguards this situation started with his ancestor zhu quan at that time when the yongle emperor acceded to the throne he relocated zhu quan prince of ning to beijing then to prevent zhu quan's treason his army and bodyguards were withdrawn and never restored until zhu chenhao's reign rise to power in the summer of in zhengde emperor's era zhu chenhao sent a eunuch to beijing with an enormous bribe for liu jin the prince wanted liu jin to restore his princely bodyguards and its revenues in return for the bribe although the ministry of war objected the princely bodyguard was restored but it was withdrawn again in september the day before liu jin was executed zhu chenhao was undaunted he tried again to restore his army in through the ministry of war lu wan several years before lu wan was an officer in jiangxi and supporter to the prince lu wan agreed to do it but grand secretary fei hong refused to sign the draft in other words he did not approve the request since he knew what the prince would do however the prince had plotted with some imperial officials such as qian ning cang xian several eunuchs and some of emperor zhengde's personal staff to cheat fei hong the plot was a success fei hong was befooled and the imperial decree was issued the prince bodyguards being restored in june the prince requested seals to give him authority to control the military army in his region he also recruited hundreds of bandits to become his henchmen in august zhu chenhao requested authority to punish guilty imperial clansmen with recommendation from lu wan zhengde emperor agreed by this time the prince of ning referred to himself as ruler his bodyguards as imperial attendants and his order as imperial edicts he also order local officials to wear formal court robes when attending to him jiangxi governor speaking on behalf of his subordinates said that it would be improper and refused to do it zhu chenhao began to recruit strategists and advisors to his cause his principal advisor was a provincial examination graduate versed in military strategy local officials who refused to support the prince were eliminated a judicial intendant of jiangxi who reported the prince's treason to the court was arrested and killed under these circumstances other local officials cooperated and said nothing in may several eunuchs from zhu chenhao's household secretly went to beijing to report his unlawful activities commander of imperial bodyguard qian ning reported this to the prince then the eunuchs were arrested and beaten to die before reaching their objective uprising in july when zhu chenhao was attending a banquet in honor of his birthday a spy arrived from beijing with the news that high officials had been sent to arrest him for that was what had been rumored in beijing he left the banquet at once and called an urgent meeting of his advisors they all agreed that the prince's plot was known and could not wait any longer to take action on july zhu chenhao assembled local officials and announced that eunuch li kuang had fooled hongzhi emperor into thinking that zhengde emperor was his son according to him the person on the throne was the child of a commoner the prince also announced that he had received an edict from the empress to punish those bandits sun sui governor of jiangxi asked the prince to show the empress's edict but he was rejected then sun sui accused the prince of treason sun sui and several officials who refused to cooperate were executed summarily the prince's army issued out from his headquarters the city of nanchang to secure the route to the yangtze river jiujiang city fell on july and the prefectural city of anqing was besieged on july when this news reached wang yangming governor of southern jiangxi at that time he soon took action wang yangming spread a false report that a huge imperial army from beijing was marching to nanchang the prince of ning did not dare to leave his headquarters for several days until he realized it was a false report on august the rebel prince and his main army reached anqing and besieged the city over ten days after many lives were lost anqing city still could not be taken on august wang yangming and his army reached nanchang the prince's headquarters was not garrisoned well and only a few soldiers of the army defended the city soon after the siege of nanchang news reached zhu chenhao he ordered a retreat from anqing and back to nanchang to protect his base wang yangming stormed nanchang and had a serious battle with the prince of ning then on august the rebel prince and his army were totally defeated by wang the prince was going to flee with a small boat but it was discovered by wang wang burned the boat before the prince reached it and soon the prince was captured wang yangming successfully put down the uprising that lasted for forty days death all allies of the prince of ning were captured including the commander of the imperial guard qian ning and the minister of war lu wan both were punished by death by slicing the imperial status of zhu chenhao was removed in and he was allowed to take his own life on january after which his corpse was burned all of the prince's family members were also executed john gunthorpe john gunthorpe died was an english administrator keeper of the privy seal and dean of wells education and career gunthorpe was a student at cambridge university and had already entered into clergyship and received holy orders by private appointment he served as a secretary to queen elizabeth by he was master of arts at cambridge university and served as a junior proctor in gunthorpe traveled to italy and was in ferrara in august he had been attending the lectures of guarino da verona on rhetoric at ferrara his teacher guarino died at the end of and this may be why gunthorpe moved on in january gunthorpe was formally taken into papal service pope pius ii examined gunthorpe for fitness and appointed him as a papal chaplain and minor penitentiary in st peter's basilica and in the papal curia from gunthorpe went through a period of study in italy where he perfected his latin rhetorical style he also learned greek and presumably italian and gained experience in the international arena of the papal court service under the king gunthorpe returned to england in and became intimately integrated into the religious diplomatic financial and political life of the court and government of edward iv gunthorpe's involvement in diplomacy concluded in when he was one of the ambassadors commissioned on march by king edward iv to embark upon an ultimately fruitless effort to persuade enrique iv against the repudiation of the treaty between their kingdoms gunthorpe was in the royal household as a king's chaplain by the summer of in he returned to cambridge university and was granted a baccalaureate in theology on december gunthorpe became the king's almoner the person who had charge of the king's charities from gifts of money to the distribution of surplus food from the king's table the office can be traced back at least to the twelfth century john gunthorpe was the first person on record to have been called king's high almoner he was also a warden in gunthorpe became a monk at st stephen's chapel and remained a monk of st stephen's for the rest of his life he was also a monk of many other chapels however even though he was a monk at all of these chapels his place of residence was with

iii he reappointed gunthorpe on june the appointment was reiterated on july the day of richard's magnificent coronation ceremony in westminster abbey john was the only keeper of the privy seal to serve richard iii he was not seen as a very smart choice of keeper since he was the former secretary of queen elizabeth and richard was fearful of a woodville faction in while serving as keeper of the privy seal gunthorpe served his king in diplomacy by in scotland and extension of a truce with francis ii duke of brittany he also helped work out a truce with the tudor family in brittany in october which was extended to why picked gunthorpe's geographical origins might have recommended him to richard in and gunthorpe was a learned man but it is the perennial enigma of richard iii that brings attention to gunthorpe in richard gave gunthorpe a present the swans in the waters of somerset the birds having a long association with royalty and chivalry tudor authority richard iii died on august and gunthorpe went to service under henry tudor henry vii also soon after richard iii died gunthorpe became the resident dean of wells as the dean of wells gunthorpe's interests extended into the judicial sphere though the court christian within his authority he presided over many cases including the case of john pope last years and death in the last year of his life gunthorpe found himself playing host to the king gunthorpe was a man of learning a rhetorician and linguist a priest and theologian and an experienced diplomat and secretary but is not survived by substantial literary remains on june john gunthorpe died he is buried in st katherine's chapel wells cathedral he answered the call of three kings to a wide variety of royal service and moved smoothly in the highest

school derbyshire under the rev william hardestee dedication of vocabularium latiale edition he subsequently took orders and moved to london in he was keeping school in dean street fetter lane but some time after he obtained the mastership of the free school at stratford bow in dyche's book a guide to the english tongue was being published by the linguist bartholomaeus ziegenbalg in tharangambadi this is believed to be the first book published in english in asia in he rashly attempted to expose in print the peculations of the notorious john ward of hackney in discharge of his ward's trust about repairing dagnam breach thereupon ward sued dyche for libel and at the trial june was awarded sizeable damages dyche seems to have died between and dyche's new general english dictionary was in print from to and went through eighteen editions his work identified as conspicuous was a guide to the english tongue which was in print from its first publication in through a edition in and a final print in this work differed from other similar works in that it emphasized pronunciation within the book words were sorted into groups where words with two syllables were further into those that emphasized the first syllable and to those that emphasized the second syllable sorting words by sound and then in order led to lists that attracted comment hiss kiss miss piss bliss this work was a good foundation for his later work on pronunciation in english which defined over words although this work was called a dictionary of words us'd in the english tongue it was a guide to spelling and pronunciation the work included a number of suggestions for changing the spelling of various words and these suggestions were in time accepted into modern english this work went

for other people with the same name see james anderson dr james anderson c was a scottish writer and minister born and educated in aberdeen scotland he was ordained a minister in the church of scotland in and moved to london where he ministered to the glass house street congregation until to the presbyterian church in swallow street until and at lisle street chapel until his death he is reported to have lost a large sum of money in the south sea company crash of anderson is best known however for his association with freemasonry biography he was the brother of adam anderson james was born about in aberdeen where he was educated and probably took the degrees of and in he was appointed minister of the presbyterian church in swallow street london whence he was transferred in to a similar charge in lisle street leicester fields according to the gentleman's magazine he is said to have been well known among the people of that persuasion resident in london as bishop anderson and he is described as a learned but imprudent man who lost a considerable part of his property in the fatal year several of his sermons were printed one of them no preached in on the anniversary of the execution of charles i was a zealous defence of the conduct of the presbyterians during the civil wars and reached a second edition anderson was a freemason and when in on the revival of freemasonry in england the grand lodge determined to produce an authoritative digest of the constitutions of the fraternity the task was assigned to him entick's edition of the constitutions et seq it was as a grand warden of the lodge that he presented to it on completing his task the constitutions of the containing the history charges regulations c of that most ancient and right worshipful fraternity for the use of the lodges london in the year of masonry anno domini this work which passed through several editions was long recognised by the english freemasons to be the standard code on its subject and was translated into german an american facsimile of the first edition of was issued at new york city in and there are reprints of the same edition in cox's old constitutions belonging to the freemasons of england and ireland and in the first volume of kenning's masonic archæological library anderson also contributed to masonic literature a defence of masonry occasioned by a pamphlet called masonry dissected which was translated into german and is reprinted in golden remains of the early masonic writers by george oliver freemasonry anderson was a freemason the master of a masonic lodge and a grand warden of the grand lodge of london and westminster he was commissioned in september by the grand lodge to write a history of the and it was published in as the constitutions of the anderson's name does not appear on the title page but his authorship is declared in an appendix anderson's work although of the first importance to the history of freemasonry is unfortunately marred by a number of extravagant claims which are simply incredible indeed it was shown at the tercentenary conference of the respected quatuor coronati research lodge at queen's college cambridge that anderson's history of the founding of the grand lodge is doubtful since the public houses mentioned could probably not have accommodated the meetings that he claims were held in anderson's account must be broadly accurate having been widely published within six years of the events described but it may have been backdated by two or three years perhaps to aggrandise some brethren as past grand officers works in appeared the work by which anderson is chiefly remembered royal genealogies or the genealogical tables of emperors kings and princes from adam to these times professedly based on genealogische tabellen of johann hübner it was largely supplemented by anderson's industry while the earlier sections of the work are of little historical value the later are often of use in relation to the genealogies of continental dynasties and houses the volume closes with a synopsis of the english peerage and in the preface the author intimated his readiness if adequately encouraged to delineate and dispose at full length the genealogies of all the peers and great gentry of the britannic isles anderson's last work which he was commissioned to undertake by the first earl of egmont and his son from materials furnished by them bore the title a genealogical history of the house of yvery in its different branches of yvery lovel perceval and gournay but the first volume alone was completed when anderson died on may and a second volume subsequently published was due to another pen see to the reader in vol ii the work was soon withdrawn from circulation on account of some disparaging remarks in it on the condition of the english peerage and on the character of the irish people it was however without the offensive passages in see notes and queries series and letters of horace walpole n and much of the genealogical matter in the book has been pronounced to be mythical drummond's histories of noble british families art percival another work of anderson's news from elysium or dialogues of the dead between leopold roman emperor and louis xiv king of france was published shortly after his death in the constitutions was edited and reprinted by benjamin franklin in philadelphia in becoming the first masonic book printed in america an electronic edition of that work is online a second london edition much expanded appeared in the work was translated into many

william lucombe began his horticultural career as head gardener in the service of merchant thomas ball at mamhead park circa it was while working at mamhead that he founded his nursery the first commercial plant nursery in southwest england marketing many of the plants collected by ball during the latter's commercial travels abroad most famously the holm oak lucombe bred his eponymous oak at his nursery in st thomas exeter which he founded in in his son john lucombe took possession of the nursery on alphington road later known as the exeter nursery in benjamin pince became a partner in the business and by the nursery enterprise was trading as john lucombe pince co at this time they bought the adjoining nursery of william ford and son on alphington street in john lucombe sold the business to captain robert pince for the nursery flourished under his son robert taylor pince but began to decline in the late century and the site was sold to the city of exeter in part of the land became pinces gardens a public park part allotments and the remainder housing main trunk of the lucombe oak at kew gardens lucombe oaks the natural hybrid lucombe oak was first spotted in when lucombe noticed that one of the saplings produced from a turkey oak acorn he had planted kept its leaves in winter he later observed that these features occurred where both parent species grew quercus cerris turkey oak and quercus suber cork oak true lucombe oaks are clones of the original tree but the name lucombe oak is also often used to refer to any spanish oak a frequently occurring hybrid between turkey oaks and cork oaks a large tree developing a deeply furrowed bark when mature leaves to about x glossy dark green above grey beneath and edged with sharp teeth raised at the lucombe nursery exeter from seed of q cerris in about it produces viable seed and many seedlings of it have been distributed one of the early lucombe oaks went to kew gardens lucombe oaks along with their descendants which include back crosses with the naturalised turkey oak are common in the landscape of east devon as well as in parks and gardens the tree register of the british isles trobi champion is at phear park in exmouth measuring metres in height with a trunk diameter of centimetres in lucombe felled the original hybrid in keeping timber from it from which his coffin was to be made when he died he stored the boards under his bed however he lived for the age an exceptionally long life dying at the age of years by that time the planks had decayed in the devon dampness instead on his death timber from one of his early graft propagations was used to make his coffin henry wemyss henry wemyss died was a prelate from the century kingdom of scotland he appears in the sources in the bishopric of galloway for the first time in and rose to become bishop of galloway in a position he held until his death in biography origin he was said to have been the son of john wemyss fifth son of sir john wemyss of wemyss by a daughter of sir john arnot of arnot in fife if true this would make him a relative of david arnot sometime bishop of galloway who resigned that bishopric in wemyss favour robert keith thought he may have been related to king james v as a brother but this was a mistake based on textual misreading mispunctuating which resulted in henry's name being confused with that of james stewart earl of moray the king's actual brother earlier career henry is found as the official of the diocese of galloway on february and again on january the last known holder of this position occurred on march so that henry must have taken this position at some point between and henry was parson of the parish church of auchterderran outherdekan fife in the diocese of st andrews and is found to be archdeacon of galloway on december like his position as official it not known when he ascended the archdeaconry and the last occurrence of a predecessor occurs on november bishopric of galloway the letter from bishop henry to abbot william kennedy of crossraguel bishop henry's signature is visible in the henry wemyss received provision to the bishopric of galloway with the position of dean of the chapel royal stirling when david arnot resigned his bishopric on january arnot retained right of return upon any future vacancy and half of the revenue of the diocese although arnot also resigned his position as commendator of tongland for once again a lifelong pension and with right of return on vacancy arnot may have effectively held on to tongland abbey for a few more years repeated crown nominations of wemyss to tongland failed apparently because of arnot while william stewart a canon of glasgow cathedral also got crown nomination until the pope finally agreed to give bishop henry wemyss tongland abbey in commendam in with stewart resigning his rights the commend of dundrennan abbey came into wemyss possession after a crown nomination on december to which he was admitted on april henry also retained the archdeaconry of galloway after becoming bishop at least until he resigned the position to patrick arnot on february bishop wemyss was a frequent attender of parliament and his name occurs frequently as a witness to charters under the great seal of scotland he appeared for the last time in the latter capacity on march he died soon after this date and was certainly dead by may on may andrew durie abbot of melrose was put in charge of the vacant temporalities of galloway and tongland durie indeed succeeded wemyss to these positions later in the year there survive some correspondences between bishop henry wemyss and william kennedy abbot of crossraguel written in the english language bishop henry and abbot william have been said to have been close friends two letters sent by bishop wemyss dated to july and to december survive the first was addressed to jhone makmaister and maister patrik ryschert officials at crossraguel abbey and the second to

clashed with montenegrins in lješanska nahija rufim reinforced them with katunjani during the day and sent dozens of small groups in total amount of warriors to spy and to attack the opponent from rear the battle lasted through whole night when at the dawn montenegrins launched a sudden charge surprising the enemy was wounded and retreated with casualties while his šaban ćehaja was killed battle of kosov lug towards the end of september newly appointed of shkodër balićević renewed attacks on montenegrins splitting his forces in two and tasking first army with penetration to cetinje and second army with suppressing rebellious forces around spuž both armies failed as the first one was stopped in lješanska nahija again without reaching cetinje and the second one was defeated when rufim personally led a side attack of katunjani in the aid of piperi bjelopavlići and rovčani forces which were already engaging enemy around the village of kosov lug the battle resulted in sultan's official recognition of montenegrin autonomy by issuing a berat which states that no turkish official if not authorised by sultan can enter montenegro without the permission from montenegrins themselves legacy although informations about his life are scarce rufim is one of better known metropolitans of montenegrin history from predynastic period his long tenure is well remembered and he is often mentioned as a contemporary of patriarch pajsije in his history of montenegro sima sarajlija lists as one of his more memorable deeds that he this metropolitan has done an exceptional deed for

by albanian priests with whom they share a border and sibling relations sima milutinović sarajlija history of montenegro it is thus possible that it was him rather than metropolitan rufim boljević who

died february was a scottish noble and prelate coming from a branch of clan campbell in the allegiance of the earl of argyll his career began in the still only a minor serving the earl of argyll's interest he was made bishop of brechin and almost immediately alienated the majority of the bishopric's historical resources into the hands of the earl after some traveling to receive a protestant education at geneva he returned to scotland in the as an adult and resumed his career as minister and now titular bishop of brechin he held this position until a year before his death accession and alienation a native of atholl and the son of eóin caimbeul sir john campbell laird of ardkinglas he was born in the century during the minority of king james vi of scotland alexander's brother seamus caimbeul james campbell of ardkinglass became comptroller still a minor on may at the instigation of gilleasbaig caimbeul the protestant earl of argyll alasdair caimbeul was put to the vacant bishopric of brechin crown nomination to the papacy was sent on july and although caimbeul was acting with a bishop's authority almost immediately there is no proof that he had received consecration until he is clearly represented as in a document dating to july the earl's purpose in pushing his young kinsman into the bishopric was made clear by the new bishop's following actions bishop alasdair proceeded to alienate most of the bishopric's lands and revenues giving the lion's share to the earl according to the historian robert keith bishop alasdair retained for his successors scarce so much as would be a moderate competency for a minister in brechin travels in may alasdair caimbeul received royal licence to leave scotland though he was still in the country in july when he voted against the proposal to annul the divorce between mary queen of scots and the earl of bothwell although his activities are difficult to trace caimbeul was attending school in geneva in january but travelled back to scotland later in the year with his tutor andrew polwart and the latter's friend andrew melville who were in edinburgh by july of the same year later episcopate after returning to his native country he resumed his charge as minister and titular bishop of brechin attending general assemblies of the scottish church in his capacity as bishop james paton bishop of dunkeld another argyll acolyte accused caimbeul of giving out pensions on the revenues of his bishopric this came before the edinburgh assembly of march which ordered that john erskine of dun superintendent for angus and the mearns instruct caimbeul on the duties befitting a bishop five years later bishop alasdair was once again in trouble with the church he failed to attend a summons issued to him by the dundee assembly of july and in another assembly ordered the presbytery of the mearns to bring charges against him the outcome of these charges is however not known as the records do not survive in the following two decades though caimbeul can be seen to take an active part in establishment politics attending many assemblies parliaments and meetings of the privy council often acting as a supporter

tōtōmi who had been defeated by imagawa yoshimoto and became a vassal of imagawa the ii family had no male heir so natora's uncle ii naomitsu tried to betrothe ii naochika his son to her so that he

prove naotora's loyalty to imagawa ujizane otazu and tsurutatsu fought to defend the castle and chikanori was killed naotora was presumed to have difficulty securing clan leadership because of the

domenico san floriano arca di san domenico niccolò c march was an italian early renaissance sculptor he is also known under the names niccolò da ragusa niccolò da bari and niccolò d'antonio d'apulia the surname refers to his contribution to the arca di san domenico the place and the year of his birth are not certain he was probably born in apulia perhaps in bari and then most likely lived for some time in dalmatia according to c gnudi see ref he received training there by the dalmatian sculptor giorgio da sebenico the burgundian elements in his sculpture are attributed by some art historians to his presumed participation in the triumphal arch of the castel nuovo in naples during the where he would have known the catalan sculptor guillem sagrera and would be influenced by his style others rejecting his training in naples contend instead that he travelled to france in the late according to them his further training then allegedly took place in siena influenced by the works of jacopo della quercia and donatello he was mentioned for the first time in september in bologna as maestro nicolò da puglia a master of terracotta figures this probably refers to the compianto sul cristo morto terracotta group in the sanctuary of santa maria della vita in bologna also mentioned in a bull of by pope paul ii a group of six separate figures stand lamenting in a semicircle around the dead christ in a lying posture the dramatic pathos the expressions of grief and torment of the figures is intensified by the realism of their dramatic facial details however the date of this innovative contribution to renaissance sculpture is uncertain instead of c some date it between and in he got the commission of an ambitious new addition on the arca di san domenico a spiral superstructure and several figures on top of the sarcophagus this sarcophagus with the remains of saint dominic had been sculpted two centuries before by nicola pisano and his workshop between and it had been completed by lapo arnolfo di cambio and fra guglielmo agnelli niccolò added an elaborate spire with an impressive statue of god the father on top of a candelabrum held by two putti and four dolphins all covered with festoons with fruit on the cornice at its base is in the middle a small pietà flanked by two angels while on the four corners stand the four evangelists in oriental dress the lower part of the superstructure is surrounded by figures the patron saints of bologna saint francis of assisi san petronio began by niccolò but finished by young michelangelo in saint dominic and saint florian on the back stand st anne st john the baptist sculpted by girolamo cortellini in san procolo and san vitale niccolò also added the angel on the left side of the altar slab the one on the right side is by michelangelo niccolò worked on this masterpiece between and leaving it unfinished he probably continued intermittently at it until his death art critics see in this masterpiece a blend of influences burgundian florentine and such as details in clothing the way these statuettes express their emotions and the patterns in their dresses and hair evoke the style of jacopo della quercia some other important works include the terracotta bust of saint dominic in the museum of the basilica of san domenico in bologna a marble statue of st john the baptist in the escorial in madrid and the terracotta figure of saint monica c museum palace in modena also notable is the terracotta high relief of madonna di piazza on the wall of the palazzo comunale in bologna in the marked drapery folds is seen the influence of jacopo della quercia and also traces of the dynamic naturalism of his contemporary andrea del verrocchio pietà arca di san domenico polychromed terracotta of saint dominic madonna di piazza bologna mummy juanita momia juanita spanish for mummy juanita also known as the lady of ampato is the frozen body of an inca girl who was killed as an offering to the inca gods sometime between and when she was approximately years old she was discovered on mount ampato part of the andes cordillera in southern peru in by anthropologist johan reinhard and his peruvian climbing partner miguel zárate juanita has been on display in the catholic university of santa museum of andean sanctuaries museo santuarios andinos in arequipa peru almost continuously since and was displayed on a tour of japan in in time magazine chose her as one of the world's top ten discoveries between may and june she was exhibited in the headquarters of the national geographic society in washington in a specially acclimatized conservation display unit in its june issue national geographic included an article dedicated to the discovery of juanita discovery in september during an ascent of mt ampato m johan reinhard and zárate found in the crater a bundle that had fallen from an inca site on the summit to their astonishment the bundle turned out to contain the frozen body of a young girl they also found many items that had been left as offerings to the inca gods the items were strewn about the mountain slope down which the body had fallen these included statues and food items the body and the items were transported to arequipa where the body was initially kept in a special refrigerator at the catholic university two more ice mummies a young girl and a boy were discovered in an archaeological expedition led by dr reinhard and prof jose antonio chavez in october and they recovered another female mummy on ampato in december owing to melting caused by volcanic ash from the nearby erupting volcano of sabancaya most of the inca burial site had collapsed down into a gully that led into the crater reinhard published a detailed account of the discovery in his book entitled the ice maiden inca mummies mountain gods and sacred sites in the andes scientific analyses body as reinhard and zárate struggled on ampato's summit to lift the heavy bundle containing juanita's body they realized that her body mass had probably been increased by freezing of the flesh when initially weighed in arequipa the bundle containing juanita weighed over pounds kilos their realization turned out to be correct juanita is almost entirely frozen making her a substantial scientific find like only a few other inca mummies juanita was found frozen and thus her remains and garments were not desiccated like those of mummies found in other parts of the world she was naturally mummified instead of being artificially mummified as is the case with egyptian mummies her skin organs tissues blood hair stomach contents and garments are extremely offering scientists a rare glimpse into inca culture during the reign of the sapa inca pachacuti reigned analysis of her stomach contents revealed that she ate a meal of vegetables six to eight hours before her death clothing and adornments juanita was wrapped in a brightly coloured burial tapestry or aksu her head was adorned with a cap made from the feathers of a red macaw and she wore a lively woollen alpaca shawl fastened with a silver clasp she was fully clothed in garments resembling the finest textiles from the inca capital city of cusco this in addition to evidence of excellent health suggests that she may have come from a noble cuzco family these accoutrements were almost perfectly preserved providing valuable insight into sacred inca textiles and on how the inca nobility dressed tools and equipment found with her in the burial tapestry was a collection of grave goods bowls pins and figurines made of gold silver and shell genetic analysis according to the institute for genomic research tigr the closest kin they could find in the database in were the ngobe people of panama but the later research has shown her to share genetic patterns found in people from the andes scientists at tigr examined two mitochondrial dna d loop sequences and found that hypervariable region was consistent with mitochondrial haplogroup one of the four native american gene groups hypervariable region included a unique sequence not found in any of the current mitochondrial dna databases her haplotype is in accordance with the genetic world map and genetic patterns her dna sequence was also related with the ancient races originally from taiwan and korea which supports the theory that had pacific links cause of death radiologist elliot fishman concluded that she was killed by blunt trauma to the head he observed that her cracked right eye socket and the fracture in her skull are injuries typical of someone who has been hit by a baseball bat the blow caused a massive hemorrhage filling her skull with blood and pushing her brain to one side thomé lopes thomé lopes sometimes modernized as tomé lopes was a portuguese scrivener writer of an eyewitness account of the second journey of vasco da gama to india thomé lopes's background is obscure all that is known is that he was a native of porto portugal in early thomé lopes was hired as a escrivão captain's clerk aboard an unnamed ship owned and outfitted by ruy mendes de brito a gentleman of the royal chamber of king manuel i of portugal and captained by an italian giovanni buonagratia joão de buonagracia of florence this ship was part of a portuguese squadron of five ships under the overall command of estêvão da gama cousin of vasco da gama this squadron set out from lisbon on april intending to catch up and join the portuguese india armada of admiral vasco da gama which had left a few months earlier february according to lopes their squadron caught up with the main armada on august at anjediva island off the malabar coast of india among the most memorable passages in lopes's account is a detailed description of the notorious massacre of the muslim pilgrim ships october a day that i remember every day of my life on the orders of vasco da gama later portuguese chroniclers have dealt uneasily with this act of cruelty but lopes's vivid and often narrative leaves little unmentioned another famous episode reported by lopes is the execution by impaling of three muslims in cochin on the orders of the trimumpara raja the hindu prince of cochin for the sacrilege of selling a cow for beef to the crew of a portuguese ship in harbor it is notable that it was admiral vasco da gama himself not usually known for his cultural sensitivity who arrested the three men and handed them over to the cochinese authorities for justice and forbade any further purchases of cows by portuguese sailors lopes and the armada left india in february beginning its return journey back to portugal lopes reports how his ship was nearly sunk in a collision with another off mozambique island somewhere around the cape of good hope in july lopes reports an encounter with two of the ships of the outgoing armada of afonso de albuquerque on july thomé lopes's ship accompanied by two others came across and landed on the south atlantic island of saint helena lopes refers to it as an unknown island and gives its position relative to ascension island which he refers to by that name it is commonly accepted that ascension island was first discovered in may on the outward journey of joão da nova and some writers have questioned how lopes could have known about that island as he left lisbon before nova's fleet returned a clue is given in lopes's own account where he describes how in august they picked up letters in malindi left by the returning joão da nova these letters might have described nova's discovery of ascension island on the outward journey although not of course nova's own discovery of saint helena on his return in may the only quibble remains with lopes's use of the name ascension island as it is commonly thought nova originally named it conceição conception island and it was only renamed ascension later may by afonso de albuquerque one possible explanation is that lopes's account might not have been written immediately in but a little later after his arrival in portugal after the name of ascension island had already been settled upon but the most probable explanation is simply that the name and maybe even the locational information was reported to thomé lopes precisely by the two armada ships that as already mentioned lopes just encountered near the cape of good hope the two would have been coming precisely from albuquerque's of ascension island the original portuguese version of thomé lopes's account has been lost but an italian translation was published in in venice in a collection of travelogues collected by giovanni battista ramusio a translation back to portuguese was commissioned and published in thomé lopes's account is one of several eyewitness account of the portuguese india armada of it is widely regarded as reliable and frequently resorted to by historians to correct the accounts by later chroniclers joão de barros gaspar correia etc

during the italian renaissance biography tobias and the angel antonio del pollaiolo he was born in florence his brother piero was also an artist and the two frequently worked together their work shows both classical influences and an interest in human anatomy reportedly the brothers carried out dissections to improve their knowledge of the subject they took their nickname from the trade of their father who in fact sold poultry pollaio meaning hen coop in italian antonio's first studies of goldsmithing and metalworking were under either his father or andrea del castagno the latter probably taught him also in painting other sources relate that he worked in the florence workshop of bartoluccio di michele where lorenzo ghiberti also received his training during this time he also took an interest in engraving some of pollaiuolo's painting exhibits strong brutality of which the characteristics can be studied in his portrayal of saint sebastian painted in for the pucci chapel of the ss annunziata of florence however in contrast his female portraits exhibit a calmness and a meticulous attention to detail of fashion as was the norm in late century portraiture he achieved his greatest successes as a sculptor and the exact ascription of his works is doubtful as his brother piero did much in collaboration with him the addition of the infant twins romulus and remus to an existing bronze sculpture of the ancient roman mythological who nursed them has been attributed by some to him he only produced one surviving engraving the battle of the nude men but both in its size and sophistication this took the italian print to new levels and remains one of the most famous prints of the renaissance in antonio took up his residence in rome where he executed the tomb of pope sixtus iv now in the museum of st peter's finished in a composition in which he again manifested the quality of exaggeration in the anatomical features of the figures in he went to florence in order to put the finishing touches to the work already begun in the sacristy of santo spirito he died in rome as a rich man having just finished his mausoleum of pope innocent viii also in st peter's and was buried in the church of san pietro in vincoli where a monument was raised to him near that of his brother his main contribution to florentine painting lay in his analysis of the human body in movement

of col manuel andre or andry this plantation was later called woodland and no longer exists who owned a total of slaves in a letter printed in the philadelphia political and commercial advertiser on february that year deslondes was mistakenly described as a free person of color the revolt main article german coast uprising deslondes had organized slaves and maroons for revolt in what is now st john the baptist parish part of the german coast of the mississippi river because it had been settled by many german immigrants in the long before cultivation of sugar cane in the area deslondes's forces recruited other slaves from plantations along the way southeast into st charles parish before turning back shortly before encountering militia sent from new orleans accounts of the number of insurgents vary from to men the men killed two whites near the beginning of their march and burned down three plantation houses and some crops they fought primarily with cane knife and captured a limited number of weapons although they had planned on more on january a planter militia led by col manuel andry attacked the main body of insurgents at the back of bernard bernoudy's plantation west of new orleans andry and his overseer a free man of color by the name of petit baptiste thomassin had been the first targets of the insurrection mr thomassin discovered the rebels who then killed him and then attacked manuel andré and seriously wounded him with an ax there have many articles which stated the younger andry had been killed as well this is completely false the younger andré gilbert andré died on january the and was buried on january the five days prior to the start of the revolt gilbert was married to the daughter of jacques deslondes marie marcelline deslondes the militia killed about forty slaves in the battle from which many slaves fled into the swamps shortly afterward militia killed fourteen more slaves in other skirmishes and captured many more although as many as may have escaped permanently after they interrogated the captives they quickly tried and executed eighteen slaves at the destrehan plantation they tried and executed eleven slaves in new orleans a total of insurgents were killed in the aftermath of rebellion deslondes was among the first captured by dogs after the battle the militia did not hold him for trial or interrogation samuel hambleton described deslonde's fate charles deslondes had his hands chopped off then shot in one thigh then the other until they were both broken then shot in the body and before he had expired was put into a bundle of straw and roasted his dying cries sent a message to the other escaped slaves in the marshes johann schobert johann schobert c or august was a composer and harpsichordist his date of birth is given variously as about about or about his place of birth as silesia alsace or nuremberg he died after eating poisonous mushrooms that he insisted were edible career in or schobert moved to paris where he served in the household of louis françois i de bourbon prince de conti he composed many books of sonatas for his instrument most of them with an accompanying part for one or more other instruments schobert also wrote harpsichord concertos symphonies and the opéra comique le et le braconnier in paris schobert came into contact with leopold mozart during the family's grand tour reportedly schobert was offended by mozart's comments that his children played schobert's works with ease nevertheless schobert was a significant influence on the young wolfgang amadeus mozart who arranged a number of movements from schobert's sonatas for use in his own piano concertos mozart biographer dyneley hussey writes that it was schobert's music that opened up mozart to the possibility of adopting a poetic stance in his music citing téodor de wyzewa and georges de work on mozart hussey points out that the four piano concertos which are deliberate studies from schobert have a typically mozartian stylized nature which is actually present in the schobert works that he was emulating hussey concludes so we may regard schobert to whom wolfgang owes so much of the romantic element which appears in his work alongside of its classic grace and vigour as being the first of his real masters in schobert went mushroom picking with his family in le near paris he tried to have a local chef prepare them but was told they were poisonous after unsuccessfully trying again at a restaurant at bois de boulogne and being incorrectly told by a doctor acquaintance of his that the mushrooms were edible he decided to use them to make a soup at home schobert his wife all but one of their children and his doctor friend died works op sonatas for harpsichord violine ad libitum op

orchard wyndham in somerset was a daughter of john wadham died of merryfield ilton in somerset and edge branscombe in devon and was a sister and of nicholas wadham of wadham college oxford buried alive her fame rests on a remarkable escape from a horrific death and her singular importance to the survival of the wyndham family in she married sir john wyndham of orchard wyndham and a year later was taken ill and thought to have died she was buried in the wyndham family vault in st decuman s church at watchet somerset and that same night a covetous sexton opened her coffin in order to remove her rings and cut one of her fingers in the process she had in fact fallen into some sort of cataleptic trance and was now awakened by the pain and rose from her coffin the sexton fled leaving his lantern behind him and with its aid she made her way home across the fields to her astounded family soon afterwards she gave birth to her only son sir john wyndham from whom every member of the wyndham family is descended apart from a branch of the family in the united states whose progenitor is vice admiral sir thomas wyndham henry viii's distinguished naval commander her remarkable survival and importance as a valuable heiress is celebrated in the family by successive generations naming the eldest son wadham wyndham most especially by the salisbury branch of st edmund's college founded by sir wadham wyndham source of story the source of the story is unclear but it appears to have become much embellished over time delderfield calls the sexton a verger by the name of attewell one of the earliest renditions is by the somerset historian collinson published in who was more charitable to the than later narrators and states relatively simply it is said that this lady was the year after her marriage sic her son was born in buried having in a sickness lost all appearance of life but the sexton hearing some noise in the coffin as he was closing the vault in the church of st decuman's she was happily taken up and soon after delivered of sir john wyndham lady wyndham's return see full text on wikisource s lady wyndham's return a poem about her remarkable escape called lady wyndham's return was written by rev lewis h court vicar of st decuman's church and includes the following verses he seized the slender fingers white and stiff in their repose then sought to file the circlet through when to his horror blood he drew and the fair sleeper rose she sat a moment gazed around then great was her surprise and sexton startled saw at a glance this was not death but a deep trance and madness leapt to his eyes the stagnant life steam in her veins again began to flow she felt the sudden quickening for her it was a joyous thing for him a fearsome woe roderick maclean for the canadian politician see roderick maclean for the scottish bishop see roderick maclean bishop roderick edward maclean june was a scotsman who attempted to assassinate queen victoria on march at windsor england with a pistol this was the last of eight attempts by separate people to kill or assault victoria over a period of four decades maclean's motive was purportedly a curt reply to some poetry that he had mailed to the queen the attempted murder followed the arrival of the royal train conveying the queen princess beatrice and the court from windsor queen victoria had just walked across the platform of windsor station to a carriage in waiting when maclean who was standing at the entrance of the station yard among a number of spectators deliberately fired a revolver at her the shot missed and maclean was seized by chief superintendent hayes of the borough police and the weapon wrenched from his grasp by someone in the crowd birmingham daily gazette other accounts state that the revolver was a toy and that his aim was disrupted by an eton schoolboy the weapon was a mere toy and the life the beloved monarch was not seriously endangered a number of eton boys were round the station at the time and one of them rushed forward and struck maclean with his umbrella disconcerting his aim which was unlikely enough in any case to have been accurate the boy in question gordon wilson was called to the castle by her majesty and thanked for his promptitude he was the son of sir samuel wilson the australian wool magnate who introduced salmon into the australian rivers and afterwards sat in parliament for a short time for portsmouth gordon wilson married lady sarah a sister of lord randolph and lady wimborne he was killed in the early days of the war the wretched lunatic therefore survived all the other chief actors in his poor little drama paying dearly for his brief notoriety he had however the distinction of undergoing trial for high treason lichfield mercury at his trial dr charles vernon hitchins testified that maclean had been certified insane in june two years before the attempted assassination and he had been sent to somerset lunatic asylum he was living wadham street in dr hitchins stated that maclean was complaining of headaches and believed that all the people in england are against him and he felt he must injure someone because they are conspiring to deceive him he had also sent letters to his sister in caroline maclean stating that if i cannot commit a murder one way i will another way and all can add is if there is more difficulty there may be more victims multiple doctors also testified that maclean was insane and did not believe he was capable of appreciating the nature or quality of any act which he might commit tried for high treason on april the scotsman was found not guilty but insane by a jury after five minutes deliberation overseen by lord chief justice coleridge and he lived out his remaining days in broadmoor asylum the verdict prompted the queen to ask for a change in english law so that those implicated in cases with similar outcomes would be considered as guilty but insane this led to the trial of lunatics act a poem was later written about maclean's attempt on the queen's life by william topaz mcgonagall joachim gans joachim gans other spellings jeochim jochim gaunz ganse gaunse was a bohemian mining expert renowned for being the first jew in north america biography early life gans was born in prague kingdom of bohemia and therefore was most likely related to david gans who settled there in england he is first mentioned in his professional capacity at keswick cumberland in he introduced a new process for the making of copper vitriall and coppris and smeltinge of copper and leade ures gans figured in the english state papers of the reign of elizabeth i and a full description of his operations is preserved in these documents printed by donald gans's most dramatic scientific discovery was to reduce the time to purify a batch of copper ore from sixteen weeks to just four days additionally gans was able to use the impurities removed from the copper ore in textile mordants colonization of america gans became the first bohemian and the first recorded jew in colonial america when in sir walter raleigh recruited him for an expedition to find a permanent settlement in the virginia territory of the new world sir ralph lane governor of raleigh's expedition led the roanoke colony on roanoke island off the coast of modern north carolina in among the ruins at the roanoke site archaeologists have discovered lumps of smelted copper and a crucible attributed to gans's work at the colony because the royal mining company failed to resupply colonists who were also becoming increasingly fearful of conflicts with the native americans they accepted an offer from sir francis drake in june to sail them to england each of the colonists including gans left north america later life and trial for blasphemy gans moved to the town of bristol where he gave hebrew lessons to english gentlemen who wanted to read the bible in its original tongue in bishop of chichester richard curteys visited gans who in speaking in the hebrue tonge proclaimed himself a jew bishop curteys asked gans do you deny jesus christ to be the son of god gans replied what needeth the almighty god to have a son is he not almighty gans was brought before the mayor and aldermen of bristol for blasphemy rather than embarrass an associate of the royal mining company town fathers referred his case to the privy council which included major investors of the royal mining company gans was transported back to london to face their judgment francis walsingham who was then joint principal secretary and other members of the council also knew him the council appears to have taken no hostile action however although the trial's outcome and all subsequent history of gans is unknown as no information is available posterity his discoveries along with the general body of his scientific work led to a degree of fame some critics have suggested that gans was the model for the jewish scientist joabin in sir francis bacon's utopian novel new atlantis although others have suggested joabin is named after joab the commander of king david's army and david's in uriah the hittite's death edward phelips

spanish accountant and captain of one of the five ships led by ferdinand magellan in his expedition of the first circumnavigation of the earth cartagena frequently argued with magellan during the voyage and questioned his authority following a failed mutiny attempt of which cartagena was the principal organizer magellan marooned cartagena on a remote island in patagonia in before continuing on to the strait of magellan early life cartagena was a native of burgos the historic capital of old castile cartagena was a confidante and nephew of archbishop juan rodríguez de fonseca the influential head of the casa de contratación which regulated trade with american colonies historians have interpreted nephew as a euphemism indicating that cartagena was fonseca's illegitimate son his age at the time of magellan's expedition is unknown but he was married and had a daughter doña catalina magellan's voyage trained as an accountant cartagena had no experience as a seaman despite this he used his influence with fonseca to secure appointment as inspector general veedor general of magellan's armada de molucca with authority to supervise the expedition's financial and trading operations king charles v of spain also directed cartagena to report on the expedition directly rather than through magellan as this split responsibility would be a source of difficulty during the subsequent voyage in recognition of cartagena's influence and in order to please his supporters magellan named him captain of the largest ship of the expedition the san antonio subject only to magellan's own authority as of the fleet cartagena earned a salary of maravedí the highest of anyone in the fleet including magellan tensions surfaced between cartagena and magellan as soon as the fleet departed spain in councils between captains cartagena routinely opposed magellan's navigation decisions and refused to salute his superior when required by custom to do so a storm delayed the fleet south of tenerife and food had to be rationed cartagena took this opportunity to publicly criticise magellan and suggest he was not competent to command magellan promptly had him arrested relieved of his command and confined aboard the victoria for the remainder of the voyage to south america mutiny cartagena remained a captive until the fleet reached patagonia on april he secretly left the victoria and reboarded the san antonio where he rallied supporters among the spanish crew and officers in opposition to the portuguese magellan in company with captain gaspar de quesada pilot juan sebastián elcano and thirty spanish crew members cartagena seized control of san antonio and declared the vessel independent of magellan's command the officers of both concepción and victoria joined in the mutiny and on april a letter was sent to magellan's flagship the trinidad demanding that the acknowledge that the fleet was no longer under his command magellan brought the trinidad alongside victoria and lowered a boat to carry back his reply when the boat crew reached victoria's deck they made a pretense of handing over a letter when victoria's captain sought to take it the boat crew stabbed him to death simultaneously fifteen men from magellan's ship climbed aboard and attacked the mutineers victoria's crew joined their cause and the ship was seized cartagena had relocated to concepción prior to the battle and so remained temporarily free however only that vessel and san antonio remained in the mutineer's hands magellan ranged his three ships across the mouth of the bay in which the fleet had anchored and cleared the decks for engagement with cartagena's two vessels in strong winds overnight on april san antonio dragged its anchor and drifted helplessly toward trinidad magellan ordered a broadside fired at which the crew of san antonio surrendered and allowed the vessel to be retaken realising the mutiny had failed on april cartagena followed suit and surrendered concepción without resistance death after the mutiny magellan held a trial of the conspirators cartagena's ally gaspar de quesada captain of the concepción was sentenced to death by beheading however magellan was reluctant to execute a close relative of fonseca so cartagena was sentenced to be marooned along with another conspirator the priest pedro sánchez de la reina the sentence was carried out on august four months after the mutiny shortly before the fleet departed their winter quarters at st julian cartagena and the priest were given a small supply of ship's biscuits and drinking water and left on a small island off the patagonian coast neither was seen or heard from again george forster murderer for other people named george forster see george forster disambiguation george forster or foster was found guilty of murdering his wife and child by drowning them in paddington canal london he was hanged at newgate on january shortly after which his body was taken to a nearby house where it was used in an experiment by italian scientist giovanni aldini at his trial the events were reconstructed forster's recounted that her daughter and grandchild had left her house to see forster at on saturday december joseph bradfield in whose house forster lodged reported that they had stayed together that night and gone out at on the sunday morning he also stated that forster and his wife had not been on good terms because she wished to live with him various witnesses saw forster with his wife and child in public houses near paddington canal during the day on the sunday the body of his child was found on the monday morning after the canal was dragged for three days his wife's body was also found forster claimed that upon leaving the mitre he set out alone for barnet in order to see his other two children who were in the workhouse there though he was forced to turn back at whetstone due to the failing light this was contradicted by a waiter at the mitre who said the three left the inn together scepticism was also expressed that he could have walked to whetstone in the time he claimed the jury found him guilty he was sentenced to death and also to be dissected thereafter this sentence was designed not only to provide medicine with corpses on which to experiment but also to ensure that the condemned could not rise on judgement day their bodies having been cut into pieces and selectively discarded forster was hanged on january shortly before which he made a full confession he said he had come to hate his wife and had twice before taken his wife to the canal but his nerve had both times failed him a recent bbc knowledge documentary real horror frankenstein questions the fairness of the trial it notes that friends of george forster's wife later claimed that she was extremely suicidal and had often talked about killing herself and her daughter according to this documentary forster attempted suicide by stabbing himself with a crudely fashioned knife this was to avoid awakening during the dissection of his body should he not have died when hanged this was a real possibility owing to the crude methods of execution at the time the same reference suggests that his confession was obtained under duress in fact it alleges that pass a beadle on aldini's payroll the whole trial and legal procedure in order to obtain the freshest corpse possible for his benefactor an illustration of a galvanised corpse after the execution forster's body was given to giovanni aldini for experimentation aldini was the nephew of fellow scientist luigi galvani and an enthusiastic proponent of his uncle's method of stimulating muscles with electric current known as galvanism the experiment he performed on forster's body was a demonstration of this technique the newgate calendar a record of executions at newgate reports that on the first application of the process to the face the jaws of the deceased criminal began to quiver and the adjoining muscles were horribly contorted and one eye was actually opened in the subsequent part of the process the right hand was raised and clenched and the legs and thighs were set in motion several of those present believed that forster was being brought back to life the newgate calendar reports that even if this had been so he would have been since his sentence was to hang until he be dead and one man mr pass the beadle of the surgeons company was so shocked that he died shortly after leaving the hanged man was certainly dead since his blood had been drained and his spinal cord severed after the execution media the galvanism experiment performed on george forster was explored in the science channel's dark matters twisted but true george forster was noted on history channel show called zombies a living history

cuningham commendatory verses in english prefixed to thomas gale's enchiridion of chirurgerie and to the same author's institution of a chirurgian gregory iv of athens gregory iv greek γρηγόριος αργυροκαστρίτης albanian grigor gjirokastriti died was a greek or albanian scholar and cleric who became metropolitan of athens in title page of the new testament in greek and albanian gregory was born in gjirokastër aryrokastro in the mid to century in he was a teacher in the new academy a famous educational institution in moscopole a leading center of greek culture at the time in he was appointed bishop of paramythia but remained in this position for only a few months in while patriarch of constantinople was gregory v he was appointed archbishop of euboea also called bishop of evripos in the summer of when the greek war of independence spread to euboea the turks put him under detention until january when freed he immediately put himself at the disposition of the greek revolutionary government in his letter to the high parliament he thanks god for saving him from the hands of the tyrants of the nation expresses his will to do his best effort for everything for the benefit of greece and especially for the people of this island euboea and requests the parliament to use him for everything that may be beneficial to the homeland it seems though that before his detention gregory had already been involved in the revolution because a good number of epirots and indeed many from argyrokastro had been fighting in euboea it is assumed by the historians that this is the reason that the turks had arrested him gregory kept on informing the central government on the situation in euboea but the government did not use him for the revolution by july the failure of revolution in euboea as well as the usurpation of his position by bishop neophytos of north euboea forced gregory among many others to flee to corfu retaining his title in corfu he translated the new testament from ancient greek to albanian along with vangjel meksi this work was partially published in corfu in and fully in it contains both the greek and the albanian text the latter printed in greek letters too gregory divided the originally one volume edition of pages into two volumes considering it a more suitable solution because albanians kept the holy scriptures close to their chest it for this work one of his biographers kourilas considers gregory as the founder of the albanian philology adding that albanologists use this translation as basic text but they only mention his gregory's name but nothing about his home country and life kourilas in he returned to euboea and on september he was appointed metropolitan of athens and remained so until his death in march he was buried in chalkis euboea in accordance to his will thomas beard thomas beard thomas beard died was an english clergyman and theologian of puritan views he is known as the author of the theatre of gods

could initiate him in this birth ridding process perur village perur is sacred not only because it is one of the sivasthalams of kongunadu but also because the divine grace of lord siva is so immanent

governorship of derry speak of his service in the wars one of the oldest depictions of fort derry ireland derry was sacked and burned by the o'doherty mcdavitt clans in he began at derry by buying land from the constable sir henry docwra who had built a town there more than thirty years after the destruction of randolph's settlement docwra incurred the hostility of charles blount baron mountjoy who became earl of devonshire lord deputy of ireland by supporting donnell ballagh o'cahan sir cahir o'doherty and niall garve o'donnell who he thought had been james i agreed with devonshire on irish policy about the desirability of ruling ulster through hugh ó neill earl of tyrone and rory ó donnell earl of tyrconnell without much regard for minor chiefs devonshire died april but he had previously approved the sale of docwra's property to paulet whom he knew well docwra accordingly sold him his house land which he had bought and his company of foot at a low price the of derry was thrown in without extra charge the new governor was established at derry in the early winter of and on february following sir arthur chichester the new lord deputy told robert cecil earl of salisbury that he was unfit for the place and that there had been many dissensions since his arrival he fell out with george montgomery the new bishop of derry over land claims tyrone and tyrconnell fled from ireland early in september the flight of the earls o'cahan who ruled the greater part of what is now county londonderry and of o'doherty the chief of inishowen in county donegal came under some suspicion docwra had tried to divide these chiefs from the earls but paulet had his own ideas on handling them o'doherty put some armed men on tory island but this seems to have been done with the consent of the few inhabitants sir richard hansard who commanded for the plantation of ulster at lifford in donegal recounts that o'dogherty left burt castle on lough swilly at the end of october to superintend the felling of timber for building but that this gave rise to a report that he was in rebellion he then began to arm about seventy followers refusing all recruits from outside his own district paulet made an unsuccessful attempt to seize burt in the chief's absence and reported everything to chichester o'doherty remonstrated with him in a temperate letter paulet then falsely denied strongly that he had ever intended to surprise burt and accused o'doherty of treason o'doherty went to dublin early in december and made his excuses to chichester who accepted them but without much confidence on april the privy council ordered him to be fully restored to such of his ancestral lands as were still withheld but this order did not reach the irish government until he was actually in rebellion rebellion main article burning of derry the annals of the four masters state that paulet struck o'doherty there is more support for the idea that paulet provoked o'doherty into rebellion by insults paulet's carelessness invited attack though chichester warned him repeatedly to keep good watch on the night of monday april o'doherty at the head of fewer than a hundred men seized the outpost at culmore by a trick and surprised derry itself an hour before daybreak paulet was killed by phelim reagh macdavitt and the city was sacked and burned sir josias bodley not however an reported that paulet fell fighting valiantly but the english government spoke of his cowardice paulet had been warned by richard hansard who held his own against the rebels at lifford despite the early success at derry rebellion was defeated by the swift response of the dublin government a force was sent out which recovered the ruins of derry and killed o'doherty at the battle of kilmacrennan marriage and issue paulet married joan kyme daughter of richard kyme of lewes sussex and margery humphrey they had a son and a daughter frances paulet married richard mascall of south malling sussex

to the ussr background peter dorschel was a ship's cook little is known of his background other than that he came from what was then the german democratic republic east germany and had visited britain on occasion prior to when employed as a seaman he had worked legally under the english permit system and in january had married christine an english model at lübeck some time prior to may and probably during his honeymoon he had been approached in his home country by two compatriots who were operating as agents for the ussr they proposed to provide finances enabling dorschel to acquire a small hotel in dunoon scotland by use of which he would be able to obtain information from local us service personnel regarding fleet movements and facilities at their polaris nuclear submarine base at the holy loch the information would be passed on by dorschel to the agents in april dorschel rented a house at hunter's quay this provided him with a good view of activity at the polaris base arrest and trial dorschel was living at webster grove prestwich england when he was arrested on may in connection with his activities then aged he was accused of inciting another man william alexander macaffer sometimes spelled mcaffer to obtain documents which might be or were intended to be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state macaffer was a bookmaker who lived at argyll street in dunoon another who was involved in the conspiracy was garry lee ledbetter a us navy shipfitter from dexter missouri us who was stationed on uss simon lake the submarine tender serving the polaris fleet at holy loch ledbetter supplied two documents to macaffer who in turn supplied them to dorschel uss simon lake at kings bay in although arrested and

fairbairn acting in his defence at the high court of justiciary in edinburgh dorschel was sentenced on june to seven years imprisonment having heard the prosecutor describe dorschel as a probably a little fish and amateurish the sentencing judge recorded that this case i am satisfied is by no means as serious as some which have happened in recent years in england nevertheless it appears that this was only through the efficient work of the security services that your activities were stopped before real tragedies occurred i agree that you were perhaps a little fish in this particular sea of trouble nevertheless these charges are always grave and serious the times reported that despite the seriousness of the charge the court hearing had been marked by some moments of levity on the public benches and drolleries from the legal participants one instance giving rise to this was a statement regarding dorschel's naivety he had been asked to supply photographs of hythe and poole to his spymasters and had instead sent picture postcards fairbairn noted that if this is how foreign espionage in matters as important as nuclear submarines is conducted we have little to fear from it alleged accomplices dorschel had from the outset with the investigation and fairbairn said that he had received no training nor had any particular ideological basis for his activities at the time of dorschel's sentencing the us navy reported that investigations were still proceeding with regard to ledbetter later ledbetter was charged by the navy with supplying a training booklet and another unspecified document to a man and a woman dorschel gave evidence in camera against ledbetter at the court martial in august macaffer and his sister frances isabella macaffer or hardless both attended but refused to supply information ledbetter who had been subjected to a polygraph test was found guilty he was sentenced to six months hard labour and discharged from the navy although charges had been laid against macaffer they were dropped in september the crown office who were responsible for prosecuting said that it was unable to provide a reason for this macaffer whose sister was the girlfriend of ledbetter then claimed that he had notified the us and british authorities of dorschel's initial approach to him and had been trying to trap dorschel since that time he also claimed that he had been told there were six east germans involved in the spy ring official bodies of both countries denied his claims of macaffer faced further charges in october relating to alleged avoidance of customs duty and illegal bookmaking that had been discovered in may later events dorschel was released in january and deported to west germany later in that year his wife christine who had been aged

poet and cleric who was provost of st giles church in edinburgh he was the uncle of the queen's new husband archibald douglas earl of angus the queen had put him forward on january just a few days after brown's death douglas had lately missed out on the position of archbishop of st andrews and so this was in some way intended as compensation douglas had a proctor pay florins to the papal see and pope leo x confirmed his position on may meanwhile andrew stewart's brother john stewart earl of atholl pressured the chapter of dunkeld cathedral to elect andrew to the see instead of douglas alexander myln in his century vitae dunkeldensis ecclesiae episcoporum lives of the bishops of dunkeld related that after hearing news of bishop brown's death atholl visited dunkeld and requested that his brother be made bishop as many of the canons were either related by blood to atholl or else held lands under atholl's power the pressure was significant and andrew stewart was accordingly elected to the see a letter was sent to john stewart duke of albany governor of scotland and guardian of the young james v of scotland albany was in france and refused to deal with the disposal of any bishopric until his return to the country when albany returned in may still he subverted queen margaret confirmed the appointment of andrew and compelled the chapter of dunkeld to hand over the temporalities of the see in july the queen agreed to andrew stewart's appointment and albany imprisoned douglas for breaking the laws of the kingdom that is on account of his purchase of the bishopric at rome however andrew stewart failed to secure confirmation from the papacy albany gave up his support for andrew and released douglas from imprisonment in september he agreed to douglas accession to the see of dunkeld douglas was consecrated on september on july albany wrote to the pope requesting that andrew stewart be given the now vacant see of caithness the pope agreed and on december andrew

renaissance he was one of the first composers of polyphony associated with the basilica of st mark's in venice and the earliest known composer to write a polyphonic setting of the magnificat for four voices life he was a priest and originally from the diocese of in the vicinity of l'aquila in the abruzzo region of central italy sometime before he began to work as a singer at san marco in venice which was then at the very beginning of its rise to fame the first mention of a choir there is found in a document of by the end of the century it was one of the most renowned musical institutions in europe quadris worked at san marco from at least the date given on his magnificat to the time that a vatican document listed him as deceased in he made repeated requests to pope nicholas v to obtain a prebend in aquileia music his musical style is highly varied and possibly he wrote his surviving pieces over a career of more than the twenty documented years the motet gaudeat ecclesia and the magnificat are stylistically related to the music of the late middle ages with a cantus firmus surrounded by texturally distinct vocal lines the other works with their lighter texture are more characteristic of italian composers writing later in the century clarity of the text is foremost in these works as is liturgical utility according to giulio cattin writing in the new grove taken as a whole his output developed in a way typical of the century from a northern late gothic idiom to the expressive tuneful simplicity of italian music the magnificat is the earliest polyphonic setting of the canticle for four voices the few surviving earlier settings are all for two or three only it is marked pbr johannes de quatris mensis maij a notation which may refer to the time and place of composition may venice or perhaps an occasion for performance or even the date the manuscript was copied quadris's music remained popular for more than half a century as shown by the many copies made of his hymn iste confessor as well as the printing of his music for the passion by ottaviano petrucci in the only source that gives quadris as the composer the music for the passion which includes lessons for matins as well as a set of lamentations also has been found in a manuscript now in vicenza which was copied around his settings of the lamentations were in use at san marco until they were replaced by those by giovanni croce in another indication of the esteem in which they were held works attributed to johannes de quadris in contemporary sources chants for a good friday procession two voices gaudeat ecclesia motet for four voices iste confessor hymn for three voices attributed to him in the manuscript by antonius janue around lamentations two voices magnificat four voices signed

altitudes can be measured and the time determined with great precision by night as well as by day he lived in the latter part of the fifteenth century and the beginning of the sixteenth originally from provence and belonging to a family that had its origin in lattes near montpellier he was forced to leave provence when the jews were expelled from that land and settled in carpentras from there he went to rome where he became physician to pope alexander vi and later to pope leo x at this time he became rabbi of the jewish community to which he was able to render much assistance he married the daughter of the physician comprat mossé of aix bonet described the use of his instrument in a treatise written in carpentras the full title of which is boneti de latis medici provenzalis annuli per eum composti super astrologiæ utilitate it appeared as a supplement to the calculatio composta in rima de juliano de dati rome and was dedicated to pope alexander vi at the end bonet craves pardon for his bad latin on the score of being a hebrew the treatise was republished by jacques lefèvre together with his own commentary on john sacrobosco's de sphæra mundi and euclid's geometry paris editions were also published in and two editions appeared later at marburg in and in bad latin bonet wrote a treatise entitled prognosticum published at rome in and dedicated to cardinal valentiniani and cardinal de borgia in which he predicted the coming of the messiah in the year a full account of the book is to be found in abraham farrisol's manuscript magen abraham or wikuaḥ a pupil of the jacob faber charles bovillus relates in the preface to his dialogi de trinitate that he met bonet de lates in the roman ghetto in and went to his house in order to see the ring that he had invented the top part of the house was a synagogue containing the ark hidden by a curtain and books lamps and here also bonet's son was discovered deeply immersed in the study of philosophy toward the end of the nineteenth century in dredging the river tiber a long marble slab was found with an inscription which had probably been affixed to this house of bonet's bovillus refers also to a lengthy theological argument that he had with bonet and he seems to imply that the son was in the end convinced of the truth of the christian faith it is evidence of the position held by bonet at the papal court that on october reuchlin begged him to use his influence in order that the examination of the augenspiegel should not be given into the hands of a commission made up of strangers at all events not of dominicans further bonet's intercession seems to have been successful bonet is known to have had two sons one joseph continued to remain in the papal favor the other immanuel was also in the

dudley was born in london england and may have been baptised in yardley hastings northamptonshire dudley's parentage has never been satisfactorily established genealogist and researcher marshall kirk in published the results of his exhaustive survey of the sutton dudley families and came to the conclusion that roger was the son of henry sutton dudley roger may also be the roger dudley who was matriculated as pensioner at christ church college cambridge in but left without a degree it is believed that roger married on june at lidlington bedfordshire susannah née thorne herself recorded as

cotton mather of boston wrote thomas dudley's father was captain roger dudley slain in the wars when his son and one only daughter were very young the will of thomas dorne thorne of yardley hastings gent dated oct bequeathed to the children of susan dudley my daughter widow to be equally divided therefore roger was dead at the time of the will of his which written in eliminates the battle of ivry as a possible date for his death it is most probable that he died at the siege of zutphen in having followed his kinsman robert dudley earl of leicester who was a principal figure in that battle which also claimed the life of leicester's nephew sir philip sidney marshall k kirk suggests that roger made his home after his father's death with peter grey a queen's servant whose manor of segenhoe was

painter of the venetian school who worked at the close of the century and beginning of the biography his real name appears to have been pietro luzzo pietro luci or lorenzo luzzo he is also known by the name zarato or zarotto either from the place of his death or because his father a surgeon was in zara during the son's childhood whether he was termed morto dead from his joyless temperament or for his investigations underground in the ancient roman palaces named grotte as domus aurea virgin and child civic museum of feltre born in feltre province of belluno he may probably have studied painting first in venice and surroundings initially an assistant of pinturicchio it is claimed by vasari that at an early age he went to rome and investigated the ancient especially the subterranean remains and thence to pozzuoli where he painted from the decorations of antique crypts or grotte the style of fanciful arabesque which he formed for himself from these studies gained the name of grottesche whence comes the term grotesque not indeed that morto was the first painter of arabesque in the italian renaissance for art of this kind had been developed both in painting and in sculpture towards but he may have powerfully aided its diffusion southwards his works were received with much favor in rome he afterwards went to florence and painted some fine grotesques in the palazzo pubblico and trained andrea di cosimo returning to venice towards he assisted giorgione in painting the fondaco dei tedeschi and seems to have remained with him till it may have been in that morto returned to his native feltre then in a very ruinous condition from the ravages of war in there he executed various works including some frescoes still partly extant and considered to be almost worthy of the hand of raphael in the loggia beside the church of santo stefano he may have met giovanni da udine towards the age of morto unquiet and dissatisfied abandoned painting and took to soldiering in the service of the venetian republic he was made captain of a troop of two hundred men and fighting valorously he is said to have died at zara in dalmatia in this story and especially the date of it

abortive expedition against quebec city then the capital of new france early career walker entered trinity college dublin in but did not take a degree and subsequently joined the royal navy he probably visited north america in reaching boston aboard the frigate hms dartmouth walker was promoted to captain about and saw action near the lizard while in command of the hms foresight in around in he joined the fleet under sir george rooke at cadiz and shortly afterwards as commodore took command of a detachment charged with cooperating in an attack on guadeloupe and martinique which was unsuccessful this failure did not damage his career though in he assisted in the relief of barcelona and two years later was appointed to command the squadron before dunkirk in march he was promoted to and was also given a knighthood expedition to canada on april the new of the white squadron was made of a secret naval expedition aimed at the conquest of new france his expedition was to attack quebec in combination with a land expedition led by colonel francis nicholson on july the expedition consisting of nine ships of war two bomb vessels and transports and tenders british and colonial with some troops and marines aboard set sail from boston on the morning of the of august just as the expedition was about to enter the saint lawrence river the wind began to blow hard from the northwest and walker was forced to seek shelter in gaspé bay on the morning of the the wind veered to the southeast and he was able to advance slowly past the western extremity of anticosti island before it died down and thick fog blanketed both shore and fleet by the the wind had freshened from the southeast and there were intermittent breaks in the fog but not sufficient to give sight of land after consulting his pilots walker gave the signal to head the fleet southward walker had thought he was in when he issued the order in fact he was about seven leagues north of his proper course and in the grasp of strong currents which steered his ships towards the northwest aided by an easterly wind the fleet was gradually closing on the north shore which in the vicinity of egg island runs almost north and south when a captain reported that land had been sighted presumably dead ahead walker assumed that he was approaching the south shore and ordered the fleet to wear and on the other tack not many minutes later he was again summoned from his bed and hurrying upon deck in dressing gown and slippers saw breakers all round us by that time the whole fleet was heading for the north shore or more accurately the coast to the westward ships in the van were already plunging on the edge of the breakers once recovered from the shock walker made all available sail and stood from the shore towards up to this time a gale had been blowing almost directly on shore and had it continued it is doubtful if many of the fleet could have survived however in the early morning of the next day the wind dropped and this lull was followed by a shift of wind which enabled most of the ships to slip their anchors and escape the shoals on either quarter altogether seven transports and one storeship were lost out of a total of soldiers including women attached to the regiments and probably sailors were either drowned or died from exposure on shore walker cruised in the neighbourhood of for two days in an effort to save what men and stores he could then following a council of war he decided to abandon the assault on quebec later life walker returned to london in october where he was not censured for his conduct in the expedition in he was appointed commodore of the jamaica station he returned a year later to england walker's journal recounting the events of was published in and

painter who was himself the pupil of the elder palma's workshop foreman bonifacio de pitati and who after bonifazio's death inherited bonifacio's shop and clientele the younger palma seems to have polished his style making copies after titian in guidobaldo ii della rovere duke of urbino recognized palma's talents supporting him for four years and sending him to rome where he remained until about shedding most remnants of roman manner after his return to venice palma adopted the inescapable models and mannerisms of tintoretto his early biographers assert that he found a place in the ageing titian's workshop when the master died palma stepped in to finish his last work the pietà in the accademia venice palma's first major public commission arrived after a fire in the doge's palace three scenes in its grand council hall by the he had digested tintoretto's versatile figure postures and titian's thick surfaces emphasis on light and loose brushstroke in palma giovane's output freedberg detects also an occasional discursive opulence à la veronese and inclinations towards descriptive naturalism à la bassano rejecting mannerism in the he embraced a reformist naturalism he varied the ingeniously synthesised amalgam according to subject matter and patrons own eclectic and conservative tastes with virtuoso skill and a facile intelligence monument to palma il giovane basilica di san giovanni e paolo he worked alongside veronese and tintoretto on the decorations in the doge's palace where he came to know fully the venetian tradition from he painted cycles of large canvases either for venetian schools or sacred buildings the sacristies of san giacomo dall'orio and of the jesuit church gesuiti the scuola di san giovanni evangelista and the oratorio dei crociferi thanks to the intelligent way they quoted from tintoretto and their own narrative drive these are palma the younger's best works after this he went back to official commissions at the doge's palace

francis hill and his wife elizabeth jenyns and hence the brother of abigail hill later baroness masham the failure of his father's business left the family dependent upon the largesse of their cousin sarah churchill later duchess of marlborough sarah paid for hill's education at the st albans grammar school from and obtained for him an appointment as a page to prince george of denmark in and then in as a groom of the bedchamber to the duke of gloucester after gloucester's death he briefly returned to prince george's household in military career the duke of marlborough obtained for hill a captaincy in the grenadier guards in november and he was made adjutant general to the forces sent into portugal in in may he was made colonel of the former lord stanhope's regiment of foot this rapid rise owed little to military talent while partly brought about through the patronage of marlborough it was increasingly due to the ascent of his sister abigail who was now displacing her cousin the duchess in anne's favour in he and his regiment took part in the expedition under earl rivers originally directed against the coast of france but subsequently diverted to lisbon in hill and the regiment were shipped to valencia to take part in the campaign which ended with the battle of almansa hill commanded a brigade during the battle comprising his own regiment with william steuart's and thomas alnutt's regiments hill's brigade attacked the french during the latter stages of the battle and allowed the remaining british forces to retreat in good order but he and his regiment were

was sent to advance the siege lines against the town and had to fight off a sally in which it suffered casualties including hill who was wounded rise under the tories by hill's sister lady masham had supplanted her cousin in the queen's affections and now joined robert harley to weaken marlborough and advance her brother the queen prompted by harley solicited for hill the colonelcy of the late earl of essex's regiment of dragoons marlborough refused to promote hill over officers more experienced and deserving placing additional strain on his relationship with the queen in april he was forced to accede to the queen's demand that hill be promoted brigadier general in may hill also received a pension of during the lifetime of the queen marlborough and the whigs in parliament attempted to have lady masham removed from court an unsuccessful move which ultimately precipitated marlborough's own political demise hill in the meantime was returned as a member of parliament for lostwithiel in he showed little activity in the house of commons although as his patroness the duchess of marlborough sourly noted he did trouble himself to vote once when ill to support harley's attacks on marlborough expedition against quebec main article quebec expedition with the harley ministry hill's star continued to rise when henry st john in revived a plan for the capture of quebec hill was proposed as to gain the queen's favor troops under hill's command in thirty transports escorted by ten ships of the line under sir hovenden walker embarked for quebec but eight transports with men were wrecked in the saint lawrence river on august owing to fogs and gales hill and walker after a council of war abandoned the enterprise without firing a shot and returned to england jonathan swift a confidant of hill noted that hill's friends privately blamed him for his irresolution and lack of leadership hill's tory connections however allowed him to escape any check in his career arising from this disaster further promotion in june hill became of the ordnance the whig thomas erle having been turned out and received the office of governor of dunkirk after the signing of the treaty of utrecht in july he was promoted major general and sworn of the privy council in november perhaps impelled by hopes of a peerage he did not stand for election in in london hill was elected to the society of wits headed by swift and st john and was known for his great conviviality he returned to dunkirk in february as a commissioner to inspect the fortifications but came back to england in august for the accession of george i later life with the death of anne and the accession of george i hill lost his offices but retained his commission as he sold his colonelcy to edward montagu in

today he was seized by the portuguese slave trader pedro gomes reinel sold to businessman juan palacios and later after transportation to what is now colombia in south america sold again to the spaniard alonso del campo in in cartagena de indias he established the maroon community of san basilio de palenque sometime in the century he was betrayed and hung by the governor of cartagena in the former african king escaped from the slave port of cartagena with ten others and founded san basilio de palenque then known as the village of the maroons in it became the first free village in the americas by decree from the king of spain when he gave up sending his troops on futile missions to attack their fortified mountain hideaway biohó made his first escape when the boat that was transporting him down the magdalena river sank he was recaptured but escaped again in into the marshy lands southeast of cartagena he organized an army that came to dominate all of the montes de maría region he also formed an intelligence network and used the information collected to help organize more escapes and to guide the runaway slaves into the liberated territory known as settlement he used the title king of arcabuco on july the governor of cartagena gerónimo de suazo y casasola unable to defeat the maroons offered a peace treaty to biohó recognising the autonomy of the matuna bioho palenque and accepting his entrance into the city armed and dressed in spanish fashion while the palenque promised to stop receiving more runaway slaves cease their aid in escape attempts and stop addressing biohó as king peace was finalized in under the governorship of diego fernández de velasco the treaty was violated by the spaniards in when they captured biohó as he was walking carelessly into the city he was hanged and quartered on march governor garcía girón who ordered the execution argued bitterly that it was dangerous the extent to which biohó was respected in the population and that his lies and enchantment would drive the nations of guinea away from the city the betrayal contributed to the history of distrust of government by the end of the seventeenth century the area of montes de maría had over maroons under the command of domingo padilla who claimed for himself the title of captain while his wife jane adopted that of viceroy and successfully challenged further

only in preview ismail pasha was an ottoman statesman who served as the governor of damascus and amir in prior to this post he served as the agha local commander of ma'arrat and steadily moved up the ranks to become the governor of the districts of ma'arrat hama and homs in and then governor of tripoli in before being assigned to the damascus governorship his consistent promotion was attributed to his successes in restoring order to the syrian countryside after a period of high instability protecting syria's farmlands from bedouin raids and ensuring the safety of the annual hajj pilgrim caravan to mecca although he was deposed from the governorship in he established his family as a major political household in syria whose members were frequently appointed as the governors of the damascus tripoli and sidon provinces and who often served longer than typical terms early career in central syria ismail was the son of a professional ottoman soldier who settled in ma'arrat ma'arra in the century ismail was known as ibn son of and early in his career as ismail agha he is first mentioned in the history records in when as the agha local military commander of ma'arra he sent wheat and barley provisions to homs after that city faced a food shortage following an attack by bedouin raiders in he was appointed the mutasallim district governor of the ma'arra homs and hama sanjaks districts ma'arra was part of aleppo eyalet while homs and hama were part of tripoli eyalet ismail was charged with repopulating villages that had been abandoned due to bedouin raids and restoring order in the districts in late the central authorities commanded him to forcibly settle the nomadic and frequently rebellious turkmen tribesmen of the region in villages in his territory was able to bring order and peace to the districts through forming local alliances and with the support of aleppo's wali provincial governor the latter used his influence to persuade the sublime porte ottoman imperial government to send ismail imperial troops to rein in the nomadic turkmen and mawali tribes the sublime porte also granted ismail and his family certain privileges that guaranteed them significant income ismail's restoration of order amid instability marked by frequent bedouin raids infighting among various military forces and the brutality of local administrators gained him a reputation as a resolute but just and even generous ruler according to historian dick douwes the chronicler muhammad praised ismail's rule and prayed that god give him strength and make him stand firm and prolong his rule and deliver him and his troops from his enemies although his appointment was for seven years by his second year in office in ismail was promoted as wali of tripoli eyalet and was thereafter known as ismail pasha during his term he successfully protected muslim pilgrim convoys on their way to damascus from where they would begin their departure to mecca to perform the hajj ismail pasha also ensured that the towns of tripoli eyalet had sufficient food supplies and he protected the province's farmlands from harvest thieves this contrasted with the other governors of tripoli who typically neglected their duties in the homs and hama districts due to the challenge posed in those regions by frequent bedouin depredations during ismail pasha's time in office the central authorities granted him a malikâne leasehold for life over the sanjak of hama while the town of hama became the countryside headquarters of the family after they moved there from ma'arra wali of damascus ismail pasha was transferred to the governorship of damascus eyalet in after a revolt in the city against wali çerkes osman pasha he was replaced by his brother sulayman pasha in tripoli while one of his sons was appointed mutasallim of hama as wali of damascus he was tasked with bringing order to the syrian interior from ma'arra in the north to the eastern bank of the jordan river in the south he was also concurrently appointed amir and was thus responsible for the safety and provisioning of the annual hajj caravan from damascus to mecca in his first four years as amir ismail pasha successfully countered four attempted bedouin raids against the caravan throughout his term in damascus ismail pasha appointed members of his family or their close associates as the mutasallims of hama homs and ma'arra he established lucrative monopolies as governor including on sheep from hama and was responsible for a number of building works in the city of damascus ismail pasha was dismissed from the governorship in late when the sublime porte accused him of embezzling money slated for provisioning the hajj caravan however this charge was deemed dubious by historian karl barbir ismail pasha was likely dismissed due to the ousting of sultan ahmed iii in a coup and the consequent dismissal of provincial governors appointed under ahmed's administration in addition to his imprisonment in the citadel of damascus ismail pasha's properties were seized by the authorities while his brother sulayman pasha was dismissed from the tripoli governorship however in ismail pasha and sulayman pasha were pardoned ismail pasha was appointed wali of crete eyalet in and served until sulayman pasha would later succeed ismail as wali of damascus in legacy ismail pasha established the foundations of the family's prominence in syria as the most powerful political household in the provinces of damascus sidon and tripoli in the century between and the family nearly monopolized the offices of wali of damascus and amir the frequent and consecutive appointments of members to damascus contrasted with the traditionally short typically terms that most governors of damascus served the fact that the were from syria also differed from the mostly officials who traditionally filled the post of wali of damascus during those years the family was able to prevent bedouin raids against syrian villages and maintained the protection of grain harvests and the grain supply to damascus among the governors that succeeded ismail pasha was his son as'ad pasha who ruled longer than any other wali of damascus serving for consecutive years jamie hawkesworth jamie hawkesworth is a british fashion and documentary photographer hawkesworth's first photography project was made in preston bus

harbored in oslo in the danish province of norway james vi joined her there and the wedding took place in norway instead of in scotland as had been planned in the spring of james vi returned to scotland after his marriage the regal voyage back from denmark was beset by storms the danish court at that time was greatly perplexed by witchcraft and the black arts and this must have impressed on the young king james in the summer of a great witch hunt was instituted in copenhagen the danish authorities issued an investigation to the cause of the storms the danish minister of finance christoffer valkendorff was accused by the admiral peder munk of having equipped the royal ship so insufficiently that it had been unable to withstand storm he defended himself by saying that the storm had been caused by witches in the house of karen the weaver who had sent little demons in empty barrows who had climbed up the keels of the ships and caused the storm karen was arrested in july she confessed to have caused the storms which hunted the royal ship by use of witchcraft and named other women as accomplices one of them was anna koldings during torture koldings described how a group of women had gathered in the house of karen where they had caused the storm of the princess ship by sending small devils up the keels of the ship she named five other women as accomplices among them malin wife of the mayor of copenhagen and margrethe jakob skrivers all women were arrested and charged while the spouse of skrivers unsuccessfully tried to defend her anne koldings was considered a very dangerous witch and referred to as mother of the devil she was treated as somewhat of a celebrity in prison and displayed to visitors she is known to have confessed to two priests and three female visitors while in prison anne koldings was judged guilty as charged and executed by burning at the stake at kronborg twelve women were reportedly executed for involvement in this witch trial in

keyboard arrangements of arias from popular operas of his time these were published in france the netherlands and germany as well as in england and formed the basis of his musical reputation his style was strongly influenced by his close acquaintance with handel johann mattheson thought he surpassed handel as an organ virtuoso but music historian charles burney criticised his manner of playing

disclosed the governor announced that he had fired kelly calling her action stupid and deceitful and claiming her actions had caused him to mislead the public that day kelly was named as a defendant in a federal class action lawsuit in the district court for the district of new jersey that cited a civil conspiracy and willful wanton arbitrary and egregious official misconduct in the wake of her firing police established no parking zones outside of kelly's home in ramsey to keep press and gawkers away while no trespassing signs were placed on the lawn of the home when she received subpoenas

involving political malfeasance kelly is a divorced mother with four jan suchorzewski portrait of suchorzewski jan suchorzewski or or a was a polish noble of the zaremba coat of arms soldier and politician he held the title of the wojski of wschowa he was a deputy from gniezno to the sejm parliament of and deputy from kalisz to the great sejm of he would be best remembered for his dramatic theatrical gestures from that period kazimierz bartoszewicz compared suchorzewski's look and attitude to that of zagłoba from henryk sienkiewicz's famous trilogy if more misguided he became an opponent of the reforms and joined the confederation of targowica biography jan was born in or as the son of jakub suchorzewski and jadwiga zajączek around he married joanna przyjemska they had three children during the great sejm suchorzewski was at first a supporter of the patriotic party in particular he supported the enlargement of the commonwealth's army in he published a brochure on the cities and law basics of urban laws zasady praw miejskich however he eventually switched sides and joined the hetman party opposed to the reforms around january he criticized the recently premiered the return of the deputy powrót posła comedy of julian ursyn niemcewicz for its political content his critique was not well received and he was ridiculed for it losing prestige despite his opposition of many reforms he nonetheless played a major if perhaps not necessarily intentional role in the passage of the free royal cities act in april as his rather unexpected involvement in the discussion boosted the supporters of the act and eased its passing for that the king rewarded him with the order of saint stanislaus suchorzewski unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the king from signing the constitution of may blocking his way and threatening to kill his own son to save him from the slavery of the constitution b in this way he repeated in an infamous or tragicomic way the gesture of tadeusz rejtan this incident was immortalized on jan matejko's painting constitution of may from suchorzewski's pocket a deck of cards has fallen out an allusion to the way he was bribed by the hetman party leaders russian ambassador otto magnus von stackelberg and hetman branicki later he would publish a critique of the constitution in the brochure uwagi nad konstytucją polską maja notes on the polish constitution of may and odezwa do narodu wraz z protestacyją dla śladu gwałtu i przemocy do której prawie w całym sejmie zbliżano a w dniu maja dokonano a declaration to the nation with a protestation for the evidence of rape and violence which was planned throughout most of the sejm and on day may carried out suchorzewski on jan matejko's painting constitution of may suchorzewski with several other opponents of the constitution departed to saint petersburg in the russian empire where he became one of the founding members and officials konsyliarz of the confederation of targowica derdej speculated that out of all those who signed the act of the confederation suchorzewski was the only one who might have thought they were really acting in the country's best interest he commanded a cavalry brigade in the confederation forces during the war in defense of the constitution that the confederates eventually won overthrowing the constitution during the kościuszko insurrection he was sentenced in absentia to a death by hanging eternal infamy loss of all titles and confiscation of possessions his effigy was hanged on the september john of gloucester john of gloucester or john of pontefract based on historical hypothesis was a son of king richard iii of england john is so called because his father was duke of gloucester at the time of his birth his father appointed him captain of calais a position he lost after his father's death he seems to have been held in custody at some point during the reign of henry vii and may have been executed around early life the identity of john's mother is not known nor is his date of birth however since katherine richard iii's other illegitimate child was old enough to be wedded in and john was old enough to be knighted in september in york minster when his half brother edward richard's only legitimate heir was invested prince of wales and to be made captain of calais in march most historians agree these children were fathered during richard's teen years there is no trace of infidelity on richard's part after his marriage in when he was around dr suggests that john was conceived during richard's first solo expedition to the eastern counties in the summer of at the invitation of john howard and that the boy was born in and named after his friend and supporter richard himself noted john was still a minor not being yet when he issued the royal patent appointing him captain of calais on march possibly on his seventeenth birthday an order referring to his appointment as captain of calais calls him john de pountfreit bastard because of this it has been suggested that he was born at pontefract michael hicks has suggested that john's mother was alice burgh who was granted an annuity of pounds when richard was at pontefract on march the grant states that it was made for certain special causes and considerations another candidate is katherine haute who rosemary horrox has suggested was a mistress of richard and possibly the mother of richard's illegitimate daughter katherine who married william herbert earl of pembroke horrox notes that richard granted katherine haute an annuity of five pounds in it is unknown however whether katherine and john had the same mother they were both of edward of middleham prince of wales career john was one of two persons knighted on september in york during the celebrations which invested his edward of middleham as prince of wales john is known to have been in calais by november and was officially appointed captain of calais by his father on march his letter of appointment has richard referring to him as our dear bastard son the patent appointing john gave him all of the necessary powers of his position except of appointing officers which it reserved until he turned it does not indicate how close to turning he was a warrant dated march to deliver clothing to the lord bastard probably refers to john under henry vii after richard was killed in the battle of bosworth field august henry vii removed john from the position of captain of calais but did not further persecute him and on march granted him an annual income of pounds sterling in his confession perkin warbeck stated that when he began his impersonation of richard duke of york in king richard's bastard son was in the hands of the king of england in the seventeenth century an early defender of richard iii george buck claimed that around the time of the executions of warbeck and edward earl of warwick in there was a base son of king richard iii made away and secretly having been kept long before in prison buck who does not identify john by name claims that he was executed to prevent him from falling into the hands of certain irishmen who wished to make him their chief or prince there are no other sources for john's execution robert browne elizabethan actor robert browne died october was an english actor of the elizabethan era and the owner and manager of the boar's head theatre he was also part of an enduring confusion in the study of english renaissance theatre two robert brownes the relevant documents of english renaissance drama contain numerous references to robert browne early scholars like e k chambers and edwin nunzeger assumed that these records referred to a single individual later scholars principally charles jasper sissons and herbert berry argued persuasively that two separate individuals had been confused and conflated into one or two at least there were obviously at least two and could easily have been three or more robert brownes who had to do with the companies and playhouses of the time to distinguish between two robert brownes the earliest years of the seventeenth century are key one robert browne was busy running the boar's head theatre in through another robert browne was performing with english actors in germany between and the boar's head browne died in and so can reasonably be termed an elizabethan actor the career of the other robert browne extended through the first two decades of the seventeenth century he can sensibly be called a jacobean actor the elizabethan actor the robert browne who is the subject of this article was the man who ran the boar's head theatre and who was married to susan browne later susan greene later susan baskervile and the father of their five children including the actor william browne browne of the boar's head was in all likelihood the browne who was a leader among the acting troupe derby's men and who received payments for court performances by derby's men in and a robert browne wrote to edward alleyn in when the subject of this article died in october joan alleyn wrote the news to her husband the later robert browne wrote to alleyn in showing that the alleyns knew both men concerning edward alleyn and the two brownes one scholar has written from the scanty record it would appear that the first was of particular interest to alleyn but not on good terms while the second appears from occasional notes to alleyn to have been confident and respectful it is not impossible that there was a family relationship between the two brownes since familial connections were common among actors and theatre people in the era consider john and lawrence dutton in queen elizabeth's men anthony and humphrey jeffes in the admiral's men a generation later plus robert pallant father and son apparently and other such pairs to compound the confusion both robert brownes had sons named robert browne jacqulyn buglisi jacqulyn buglisi is an american choreographer artistic

from monmouth county had blood she also collected culex species in the same counties out of which only contained blood the blood samples were from meals of the following mammals humans cats or dogs as well as opossums gray squirrels cottontail rabbits and a mouse in the study it was suggested by her and her team that of humans were bitten by a albopictus in a suburban monmouth while the urban

and judge of the seventeenth century he was born at rathgar then deep in the countryside now a suburb of dublin the second son of robert cusack of rathgar castle which adam inherited on the death of his elder brother and his wife alice daughter of sir george sexton of limerick his father sat in the irish house of commons as mp for kells in he was the grandson of john cusacke died a wealthy dublin merchant who was lord mayor of dublin in and his wife margaret gough née allen the cusacks originally came from ballymolghan county meath during the battle of rathmines in august rathgar castle was surrounded by troops but not attacked adam and his father were both in the castle at the time he was educated at trinity college dublin and became a fellow of the college in he entered lincoln's inn in was called to the bar in and entered the king's inn in his choice of the law as a profession may have been influenced by the fact that james barry baron barry of santry a leading barrister who became lord chief justice of ireland in was his cousin his mother being adam's paternal aunt anne cusacke adam was appointed second justice of the provincial court of connacht in and became the last chief justice of connacht in on the abolition of that office in he was appointed a justice of the court of common pleas ireland in the relaxed political atmosphere of the early his background and tolerant attitude to roman catholics were not a professional disadvantage he had also the advantage of having married catherine keating sister of john keating later to be chief justice of the irish common pleas and niece of maurice eustace lord chancellor of ireland the only serious objection to his appointment to the high court bench was his health from early middle age onwards he suffered badly from gout which became so severe that he was unable to perform his judicial duties for at least two years he died aged only about in and was buried in st audoen's church dublin in his will which according to elrington ball shows his kindly and charitable nature he left money to the poor of st audoen's parish and of rathfarnham for the relief of poor prisoners and bequests to the bluecoat school at oxmantown and to the army hospital at back lane dublin the bulk of his estate was left to his widow catherine who remarried his cousin nicholas cusack she and adam had no children rathgar castle fell into decay in the eighteenth century and was a ruin by when the artist gabriel beranger did a watercolour which shows two men surveying the remains the castle's precise location is something of a mystery but it probably stood on what is now highfield road at the present site of st luke's hospital rathgar it was built by the segrave family in the sixteenth century on what had previously been monastic land and was bought by adam's grandfather john in hatem beg ordubadi hatem beg ordubadi persian حاتم بیگ اردوبادی was an iranian aristocrat from the ordubadi family who served as the grand vizier of the safavid king shah abbas i r from to biography background and early life hatem was the son of bahram khan ordubadi the lord of ordubad the homeland of the ordubadi family an iranian family which was descended from the medieval philosopher and polymath nasir hatem later succeeded his father as the lord of urdubad and received the title of beg lord due to local disagreements he resigned however and went to the royal court in the ensuing period he served as vizier of the governor of khoy however when the latter was dismissed later on hatem beg lost his job as well and settled again in ordubad and later ardabil his fortunes changed in the early rule of abbas i when he was appointed as the vizier of the governor of kerman vali beg yuz bashi afshar and was later made the accountant mostowfi of yazd vizierate under shah abbas i in hatem's brother abu taleb beg then the mostowfi was sent as an envoy to the ruler of the uzbeks abdullah khan ii who was trying to take herat from the safavids at the time abdullah khan ii was not interested in negotiations and had abu taleb beg executed by putting him in front of the mouth of a cannon as a result of this gruesome tale in relation to his close relative hatem beg was taken under abbas i's wings and in he appointed him as the mostowfi of all of iran while six months later he made him his grand vizier hatem beg who became known by his honorific of daulat trusty support of the state which was given to every safavid grand vizier demonstrated to be a statesman of noteworthy capacity during his tenure as grand vizier during his tenure he managed to form a highly potent state administration that allowed the country to persist to prosper under considerably less adept shahs after abbas i's death the safavid court historian iskandar beg munshi who was attached to the retinue of hatem beg states that he brought security into the lives of iranians and was a model for all in regard to the administration of justice his knowledge of accounting procedures and his organisation of divan affairs hatem beg was evenly held in high regard by the europeans the carmelite monk father paul simon recounted hatem beg's calmness in dealing with difficult tasks he describes how hatem beg used to despatch petitions in a morning and after having sat and given a hearing for six or seven hours would go out as serene as if he were coming from taking his horse for a walk aside from his administrative responsibilities hatem beg also distinguished him as a military commander in the consolidation of the country it was unusual for a person of iranian stock to be involved in military affairs the iranian statesman mirza salman jaberi who had served as grand vizier from to had as a result of his involvement in military affairs made the qizilbash hostile towards him who felt that their power had been usurped mirza salman jaberi was eventually murdered by the qizilbash hatem beg's involvement in military affairs however did not arouse the antagonism of the qizilbash which in the words of david blow was a sign of changing times in hatem beg together with a group of administrators and accountants were sent to the newly subdued province of gilan where they improved the structure of tax charge and contribution which supposedly was done at the demand of the residents who were discontent with the oppressive governorship of mehdi qoli khan shamlu more likely however this reform took place due to the economic capability the province offered its rich silk manufacture tea caviar and lumber encouraged abbas i to dispatch his most prominent officers to overhaul the economic system of the province in a just approach death and offspring hatem beg died in near urmia during an expedition he was buried in mashhad his son mirza taleb khan ordubadi succeeded him as grand vizier occupying the office till he was reappointed as grand vizier during the reign of shah safi r from until where he was assassinated by the eunuch saru taqi due to a personal hatred he had towards the ordubadi family the reason being that hatem beg had denied to give saru taqi's father a post which he had asked for tupoumoheofo tupoumoheofo was tu'i kanokupolu of tonga and the only female to ever hold that title she was the principal wife to the tu'i tonga though she may have been of higher social rank than him because of her matrilineal descent after a vacancy in the tu'i kanokupolu title she used her status to designated herself successor reigning on tongatapu for slightly less than one year starting in perhaps before being forcibly deposed by her distant relative tupoumoheofo retreated to retirement in the northern tongan island of under the protection of the ulukalala family family and social rank in the late century tupoumoheofo may have been the person in tonga due to her matrilineal descent her mother was tamaha the sacred eldest daughter of the eldest sister and thus the person holding the highest rank in der grijp she also earned high status through her patrilineal descent as her father was tupoulahi the kanokupolu tupoumoheofo was a sister of the kanokupolu in the late tupoumoheofo married tonga paulaho the tu'i tonga as principal wife the moheofo whom she is often considered to have helped in assassinating in with her husband paulaho tupoumoheofo had several daughters fuanunuiava the future tonga is often said also to be a son of this marriage and that obtaining him his future title was one of main goals a genealogy collected by neil gunson suggests however that fuanunuiava was not son but instead son from his secondary wife herda and therefore tupoumoheofo would have little reason to push him into power the death of her husband there is some disagreement over when paulaho was murdered whether it was or a decade later he most likely died in or just before tupoumoheofo claimed the title of kanokupolu in an interview by a spanish sailor years later tupoumoheofo claimed to have been a leading participant in an alliance of the kanokupolu lineage that set out from tonga with some large canoes putting into the ports of annamoka nomuka and happai they passed to vavao where paulajo paulaho as the head of his people received them there was a clash which ended with the death of the latter at the hands of vuna after these two leaders fought hand to hand this put her in alliance with mumui who though later her challenger was a relative of the kanokupolu line the result was to completely debase the power of the tonga line and elevate the kanokupolu line ascension to tu'i kanokupolu around the kanokupolu gave up his title rather quickly after attaining it some surmise that either he lost influence he obtained a different title that mumui and forced him out or that tupoumoheofo herself instigated the change though the next kanokupolu would be officially voted on by the ngata chiefs ancestral protectors of the kanokupolu line in hihifo tongatapu the decision was really because of her rank mumui a powerful elder chief on tongatapu expected to receive the title he shared ancestry with tupoumoheofo through the sixth kanokupolu but his was of a lesser line politically ambitious son and then governor of eua strongly supported his claim with hopes of securing power for their line tupoumoheofo however did the unexpected by naming herself as kanokupolu she went to hihifo put a mat about her waist and sat with her back to the koka tree beneath which the installation of the kanokupolu took place then she came back and declared herself kanokupolu this appropriateness of ascension is controversial among historians early european missionaries in tonga labeled her act as subversive tyrannical odious in the extreme and an anthropologist has considered it unrightful more recent scholarship has suggested that her action was not actually without historical precedent and was positively in line with her traditional position and rank tupoumoheofo did have the immediate the support of many chiefs war with incensed by tupoumoheofo taking the title of kanokupolu instead of giving it to his own father mumui denounced tupoumoheofo and seized some her estates she refused to step down reminding him that he was of a lower rank than she was she threatened his life if he continued his insubordination in he invaded tongatapu with an army and defeated her though the tongatapu chiefs guaranteed her safety because she was the daughter of a tamaha and allowed her into exile in tupoumoheofo soon raised a new army and attacked tongatapu but was again unsuccessful this time she was pursued to where her army was trapped on the island of sic and slaughtered its bones were still easily visible in great number half a century later as victor in the brief war appointed his father kanokupolu tupoumoheofo spent the remainder of her days in under the safety of the ulukalala family which was at odds with and mumui it was finau ulukalala ii and his relative toupouniua who assassinated in william mariner a british sailor taken in by finau ulukalala from to writes that the assassination was done at the insistence of tupoumoheofo to avenge her earlier defeat legacy and sources most of the primary sources about tupoumoheofo come from europeans who often had conflicting accounts descriptions timelines and biases the absence of consensus makes her a controversial figure many of these historiographers were guests of enemies who eventually gained power and defeated her the descendants of these enemies are current royal family these sources tend to perceive her negatively as an egregious usurper of power she is also often accused of using her power to implant her supposed son fuanunuiava as the tonga recent scholarship however claims her actions were within historical precedent and acceptable to her social rank there is also some evidence that suggests that fuanunuiava was not in fact her son there is agreement that at the close of the century the old order that divided responsibilities between the tonga tu'i ha'atakalaua and tu'i kanokupolu chiefly lines dissolved and that the kanokupolu line controlled by the tupou family eclipsed the others actions and those of her immediate successors are best understood as an attempt to consolidate power during this chaotic time charles dieupart charles dieupart after was a french harpsichordist violinist and composer although he was known as charles to his contemporaries his real name may have been françois he was most probably born in paris but spent much of his life in london where he settled sometime after a prominent member of the drury lane musical establishment dieupart was active both as composer and performer and actively participated in the musical life of the city however after about he earned his income mostly by teaching and in his later years lived in poverty he is best remembered today for a collection of six harpsichord suites which influenced johann sebastian bach's english suites life details of dieupart's early life and training are sketchy and the reason for his emigration to england is unknown the earliest document to refer to the composer is his own six suittes de clavessin published in amsterdam in he is next heard of on february in london when he performed corelli's music at drury lane with gasparo visconti dieupart settled in london and eventually became an important member of the drury lane musical establishment he collaborated with playwright peter anthony motteux composer thomas clayton and others he also participated in performances of music by italian composers such as giovanni bononcini and domenico scarlatti in late dieupart became involved in establishing an operatic project at the queen's theatre in the haymarket london although he evidently played a significant part in the project he was dropped by the management after about a year in late dieupart tried organizing a series of concerts at york buildings in and but ended up giving only a few after he was mostly active as a teacher although his music was still performed in concerts until at least and he was apparently a regular member of the drury lane orchestra dieupart's last known public appearance was in according to music historian john hawkins whose work is the most important source on dieupart's biography the composer died at a very advanced age and in poverty music dieupart's work is six suittes de clavessin amsterdam as the title indicates it contains six harpsichord suites all of them are in seven movements always with the sequence ouverture allemande courante sarabande gavotte a menuet or a passepied and a gigue as the final movement some of the movements are linked thematically the music represents a highly successful synthesis of french italian and english styles married with imaginative harmony the same can be said about most of dieupart's other music which has been neglected in recent times the suites were popular even during the composer's lifetime they were reissued already in arranged for violin or recorder voice flute and fourth flute and basso continuo and then of the movements were published in london in as select lessons for the harpsichord or spinnett johann sebastian bach copied all six suites sometime between and and was influenced by dieupart's music particularly in the famous english suites dieupart's suites may have also inspired nicolas siret whose first book adopts the suite's initial opening as an example list of works six

of queen margaret leijonhufvud and thereby great grandmother of king john iii of sweden and king charles ix of sweden she is remembered as one of several possible people later identified with the famous legend of pintorpafrun biography anna karlsdotter was the daughter of noble riksråd karl bengtsson of the vinstorpa family and katarina karin lagesdotter sparre d and sister of knight and riksråd örjan karlsson d in she married to riksråd lord erik karlsson vasa of stäkeholm and rumlaborg a cousin of erik johansson vasa father of gustav i of sweden she became a widow when her husband was shot in for harassing a priest in she remarried erik eriksson gyllenstierna the younger who was lynched in for having capitulated to the danes at älvsborg she had many children among them ebba eriksdotter vasa and margareta von melen upon the death of her childless brother she became the last descendant of the vinstorpa family iii and the heir of the family estates after having been widowed a second time she bought the manor pinntorp in sudermannia in and devoted the rest of her life to the management of her estates in addition to the estates she inherited she expanded her lands by acquired more and more land in västergötland over a period of almost fifty years and became a very substantial rich and noted landowner in for example her borrowed money from her to be able to lodge her daughter ebba and their children in västerås abbey while he attended the coronation in stockholm something that saved them from the stockholm bloodbath upon the marriage of her granddaughter margaret leijonhufvud to the king in she benefited as did all the relatives of margaret and was granted land and privileges such as the right to certain taxes and fines from the king as a landowner anna has been pointed out as one of the possible people identified with pintorpafrun the infamous pintorpa lady known for torturing her tenants to death while she did own the estate pintorpa there are no sources which portray her as cruel and a more likely person behind the pintorpafrun is barbro eriksdotter bielke she was however known for being a firm and tough businessperson who did not hesitate to involve in conflict and court cases over inheritance and land disputes in her accumulation of land and during the she was reportedly involved in a number of court cases over land with several members of the royal council in contrast to her daughter ebba eriksdotter vasa and granddaughter margaret leijonhufvud lady anna does not appear to have been a supporter of the catholic church in her business ambitions she took advantage of the new law introduced by the swedish reformation which allowed for people to retract property donated to the church by their ancestors in accordance with the reduction of gustav i of sweden and confiscated property from the skara church by retracting the donation letters on her own accord and without asking for the necessary permit from the king more or less by force but was ordered in a strict letter from the king to give it back to his majesty she was also reprimanded by the king for having expanded her estates and founded more farms than she was allowed to thereby having intruded on the both the land of the king as well as the common land of the peasantry joseph vernon joseph vernon in character as thurio in the two gentlemen of verona

fast jimmy philip jimmy philip was the very first manager of scottish football club aberdeen fc he was in charge of the club from its foundation in until his retirement in he died in a car crash in belfast in early life little is recorded about philip's early life but it is known that he was a native aberdonian that he had a wide range of sporting interests and that he had proposed to underwrite the very first overseas tour by a scottish international team he was also a referee although by profession he was a aberdeen fc manager philip was appointed manager for the first competitive game of the new club a draw with stenhousemuir on august in that first season aberdeen won the aberdeenshire cup and subsequently made a bid to be elected to the scottish league first division philip was despatched to glasgow to make the club's case and returned with the promise of enough support however the final decision of the existing league members was to elect aberdeen to the second division during that second season the qualifying cup was won at dens park in dundee a victory over renton former scottish cup holders progress in the league was not so straightforward and the club ended the season in seventh place of twelve however a proposal by celtic to expand division to clubs meant that places were available for the season and aberdeen were duly elected thereafter progress was steady rather than spectacular the club finishing in position in the next two seasons although there was a scottish cup in in which celtic prevailed at pittodrie for the next few seasons aberdeen seem to have been genuine contenders for league honours topping the table on more than one occasion but never at season's end in the season both rangers and celtic were beaten at pittodrie for the first time and another cup followed that game too was lost to celtic but the strength of the side that season led to an invitation to a close season tour of bohemia moravia and poland after the end of the season philip served as a referee at the olympic games in stockholm in april philip's position became in spite of the relative penury of the club at this time but during wartime the position reverted to the manager and players struggled on through the early years of the war the team often made up of locally billeted servicemen but by early the strain on finances and the lack of public enthusiasm was too much and the club withdrew from competition on the resumption of football in philip was offered his old post at a salary of per annum a move which caused some controversy among the directors at the time philip accepted and prepared to take the club forward into the new decade the early proved no more fruitful for philip and his team than the prewar era but one record was set which still stands as of aberdeen's record victory of over peterhead in there were two further unsuccessful cup in and but philip's reign came to an end with no senior silverware to show for it final years philip retired as aberdeen manager at the end of the season becoming a director and was also involved with the clan macgregor he died in a road traffic accident in belfast in managerial honours aberdeen aberdeenshire cup scottish qualifying cup managerial statistics as of december rahua ocllo the coya rahua ocllo or araua ocllo floruit was a princess and queen consort coya of the inca empire by marriage to her brother the sapa inca huayna capac r marriage rahua ocllo was the daughter of the inca topa inca yupanqui and sister of huayna capac after his succession to the throne in her brother the inca first married their sister coya cusirimay who became his queen he also had many children by several concubines however coya cusirimay had no sons and may also have died early on topa inca married another sister rahua ocllo who became the mother of huáscar and chuqui huipa reign of huáscar at the time of her huayna capac death in she her daughter and his entire harem was in quito with him her spouse had willed his throne to his illegitimate son her stepson atahualpa but her own son huáscar had the will overturned executed his fathers executors and claimed the throne for himself he then ordered for his mother sister and the rest of the harem to be brought to cuzco as he wished to follow the ancient custom to marry his sister to even more ensure that his own blood line would be completely legitimate the wedding was performed with some difficulty rahua ocllo had initially refused to give her consent to it which was crucial for it to take place her reason is reported to have been personal discontent with huascar and disapproval of his execution of her late husband's executors she is reported to have favored the illegitimate son of her spouse atahualpa who had been brought up in her household before huascar as the wedding was important for the succession to continue undisturbed this presented a problem for huáscar she was finally forced to consent and the wedding and coronation could take place huascar viewed his brother atauhalpa as a threat and had many people at court executed because he believed their loyalty to be faltering atauhalpa who resided in a different part of the realm had been absent from the coronation of huascar he did however send his loyalists and spokespersons with gifts and greetings to the queen and her mother in cuzco who received them kindly this exposed them both to suspicions from huascar who assumed them to belong to the opposition and of taking sides with atauhalpa against him as soon as the visitors left huascar caused a scene by entering the queen's audience chamber and accusing rahua ocllo of being the prime adviser of atauhalpa and them both of disloyalty both rahua ocllo and her daughter denied the accusations and huascar was not able to prove anything against them he did however had them placed under guard and spies placed around them to report of their every act the queen reacted very badly to be placed under such circumstances reportedly she took such offence of being put under watch that she refrained from eating during day time and only took one meal during the night to ensure that the spies would have nothing to report not even such innocent activities such as eating her new conditions also caused a depression and she reportedly took to abuse coca both to sleep at night but also during day time the bad relationship between the royal couple was noticed and attracted public attention and bad publicity when huascar had several members of the embassy atauhalpa had sent to him in quito executed the remaining member of his embassy quilaco appealed to the queen and her mother for help when the civil war erupted between the two brothers the situation for the queen and her mother became even more difficult when atauhalpa escaped from his brothers custody they were both reportedly very close to being arrested and executed reign of atahualpa in huascar was defeated and taken prisoner by the army of atauhalpa who paraded him in public as a prisoner to the capital of cuzco after the battle of quipaipan upon entering the city the loyalists of atauhalpa reportedly called rahua ocllo a concubine rather than a queen in order to present huascar as illegitimate despite this rahua ocllo approached her captive and deposed son by reproaching him in public she explained that though he was her son he deserved his present predicament because of his execution of atauhalpa's ambassadors for all his misdeeds and for having dragged down his entire family including her in his ruin without cause and slapped him in public qazi ghulam mustafa qazi ghulam mustafa died c ah ad was one of the prominent noblemen during the mughal empire he was entitled kar talab khan by bahadur

was a noblewoman of the fitzgerald dynasty in ireland english writers of the tudor period including sir walter raleigh helped popularise the old countess of desmond as a nickname for her due to her longevity one estimate placed her age at death in excess of years another ranged as high as most likely she lived to about a recent biography of the countess suggested that katherine was at least when she died life lady desmond was the daughter of sir john fitzgerald second lord of decies in waterford and ellen fitzgibbon she was probably born at dromana in county waterford in she married becoming

the crown after the desmond rebellions inchiquin castle and its lands were granted to new england colonist sir walter raleigh who then leased out some of the land while preserving the life interest of the countess in the castle she survived far beyond raleigh's expectations and sir richard boyle who purchased raleigh's colonial possessions in ireland including the castle brought proceedings to evict the old lady a legend claims that to protect her interests in the castle the impoverished old countess set out from cork in after sailing to bristol she walked the road to london with her invalid daughter who she pulled along in a cart in the century it was claimed that this story arose from a confusion with another dowager countess of desmond who travelled to london to petition

and that she fell hurt her thigh contracted fever and died another attributed her death to a fall while picking cherries she is believed to be buried with her husband in a franciscan friary at youghal clodagh tait has questioned the generally accepted date of death of citing evidence that lady katherine may have died as early as there are two portraits of lady desmond whose provenance is confirmed and a third whose authenticity is less age raleigh in his history of the world maintained that lady desmond married in the time of king edward iv making her at least years old at the time of her death she was said to have danced with king richard iii then duke of gloucester in fact she could not have been married earlier than as her husband's first wife sheila gilis the daughter of the lord of muskerry was still alive in that year the tradition that she died at age was recounted in fynes moryson's itinerary and sir francis bacon's history of life harington writing in referred to a man who lived longer than years and to a woman and she a countess who lived longer than if katherine fitzgerald married in her early twenties this latter description would match her historian ian mortimer

syriac orthodox priest and bishop who played a significant role in printing the first syriac bible and served as perhaps the first syriac in europe biography moses was born in the village of qaluq near mardin in the tur abdin region moses is first mentioned in as an envoy of the jacobite patriarch of antioch ignatius abdullah i stephan to rome to seek the means to print syriac copies of the new testament his mission also included negotiations of unity with the catholic church in anticipation of the patriarch's arrival whilst in rome moses stayed in the monastery of st stephen of the abyssinians where johannes potken had printed the first ge'ez book psalterium david et cantica aliqu here he printed a syriac manuscript with the assistance of the cardinals marcello cervini reginald pole and jean du bellay however the manuscript produced was defective as the printers did not understand the language in moses travelled to venice to meet guillaume postel to promote the idea of printing a syriac copy of the new testament which postel had been working on since despite this postel could not help print it as he did not have the characters to print in syriac in moses then returned to rome where he taught syriac to andreas masius and johann albrecht widmannstetter among others upon the advice of masius he left rome in the company of cardinal pole as he was returning to england to meet johann jacob fugger in augsburg however whilst staying in dillingen he met johann albrecht widmanstetter then chancellor of the austrian lands both sharing the same goals of printing a syriac copy of the new testament widmanstetter travelled with moses to vienna where they convinced ferdinand i to fund their project thus one thousand copies of the syriac version of the new testament was printed in and moses himself received half of which to distribute in the east moses remained in europe until before returning to the east however before departing he sold copies on the european market in he is mentioned returning to rome as a bishop accompanied by the deposed patriarch ignatius nemet allah i in moses was appointed professor of syriac at the college of the neophytes mushe of

in or shortly before the aim of the mission was to search for syriac printed books or for opportunities to produce them whether mushe was additionally entrusted with the delicate task of improving relations between the syr orth and the roman catholic church remains disputed mushe lived in rome and traveled through europe until some time after in rome he established contacts with some of the earliest western scholars interested in syriac among them were guillaume postel johann albrecht widmanstetter and andreas masius he collaborated with widmanstetter in the publication of the first edition of the syriac nt which appeared in vienna in and whose syriac typeface derived from handwriting mushe served as syriac teacher in rome and the latter frequently consulted him in particular while he was preparing his syrorum peculium a syriac glossary that was included in vol of the antwerp polyglot mushe and masius corresponded in syriac a number of letters belonging to the period are preserved masius also translated into latin a profession of faith that mushe is said to have made in and which masius included in one of his later publications its exact status remains unclear during his time in europe mushe copied many syriac mss several of these are extant including the remarkable ms london brit libr harley which contains parts of the roman missal in latin written in serṭo script along with three syriac anaphoras mushe wrote it for the bp of the abyssinian convent san stefano in rome where he often resided and it shows his interest in and familiarity with the catholic liturgy after mushe returned to the middle east where he copied some further mss among them michael chronicle probably from the autograph and where the solely honorific title of metropolitan bp was conferred on him he returned to rome probably in the company of patr niʿmatullāh following the abdication in in rome he copied and annotated several more syriac and arabic mss he died in or shortly

of tofield alberta authorities suspect he wasn't from alberta but most likely worked as a migrant worker discovery sam was found wearing a blue levi shirt with snap buttons a gray blue jeans and imitation wallabee shoes his decomposed body was wrapped in a yellow bed sheet and tied up with a nylon rope sam was found by a local couple scavenging their abandoned property for a septic tank pump after seeing his leg bobbing in their old septic tank they alerted the tofield royal canadian mounted police rcmp detachment two officers came to the scene to recover sam's body where they spent an hour emptying the meter deep septic tank with empty ice cream pails autopsy a medical examiner in edmonton determined sam to be of european canadian descent his bones and teeth suggested he suffered from an unspecified illness at five years old sam's cause of death was two gunshots to the head and chest although it was possible there could've been more if any of the bullets didn't reach his skeleton before his death sam had been tortured he'd been beaten tied up burned with a small butane torch and cigarettes and sexually mutilated with farm shears the sexual mutilation was so severe that the medical examiner took several months to positively identify him as a male based on the burn marks on his shirt sleeves sam could've been tied to a bed while tortured after sam's death he'd been covered in quicklime most likely in an attempt to quicken decomposition investigation due to a lack of evidence in the septic tank sam was most likely murdered elsewhere and the septic tank was only a dumpsite sam's murderers are believed to have known him due to how viciously he'd been killed it's also suspected sam's murderers were tofield locals or were familiar with the area due to the location of sam's dumpsite being on a rural property sam's body has been exhumed from his unmarked grave in an edmonton cemetery twice in sam's remains were flown out to clyde snow and betty gatliff

sam the two could tell by measuring his hands that he was right handed snow believed sam to be of indigenous origin and around years old contradicting the rcmp's belief of sam being a european canadian and between to sam was exhumed and reconstructed for the second time in by cyril chan who was with the edmonton medical examiner's office at the time aftermath the residents of tofield at the time were horrified to hear of sam's murder farmers checked their own septic tanks for bodies and business owners worried that sam's murderers could've been regular customers many speculated sam had been sexually mutilated due to committing a sex crime or being unfaithful in a relationship ed lammerts one of the officers who helped recover sam's body has since retired he believes sam will never

her hat he sprang on his wheel and raced jolting and pounding down the corduroy to meet them the bird woman stopped the horse and the angel gave him the bit of print paper freckles leaned the wheel against a tree and took the proof with eager fingers he never before had seen a study from any of his chickens he stood staring when he turned his face toward them it was transfigured with delight you see he exclaimed and began gazing again oh me little chicken he cried oh me ilegant little chicken i'd be giving all me money in the bank for you then he thought of the angel's muff and mrs duncan's hat and added or at least all but what i'm needing bad for something else would you mind stopping at the cabin a minute and showing this to mother duncan he asked give me that little book in your pocket said the bird woman she folded the outer edges of the proof so that it would fit into the book explaining as she did so its perishable nature in that state freckles went hurrying ahead and they arrived in time to see mrs duncan gazing as if awestruck and to hear her bewildered weel i be drawed on freckles and the angel helped the bird woman to establish herself for a long day at the mouth of sleepy snake creek then she sent them away and waited what luck would bring to her now what shall we do inquired the angel who was a bundle of nerves and energy would you like to go to me room awhile asked freckles if you don't care to very much i'd rather not said the angel i'll tell you let's go help mrs duncan with dinner and play with the baby i love a nice clean baby they started toward the cabin every few minutes they stopped to investigate something or to chatter over some natural history wonder the angel had quick eyes she seemed to see everything but freckles were even quicker for life itself had depended on their sharpness ever since the beginning of his work at the swamp they saw it at the same time someone has been making a flagpole said the angel running the toe of her shoe around the stump evidently made that season freckles what would anyone cut a tree as small as that for i don't know said freckles well but i want to know said the angel no one came away here and cut it for fun they've taken it away let's go back and see if we can see it anywhere around there she turned retraced her footsteps and began eagerly searching freckles did the same there it is he exclaimed at last leaning against the trunk of that big maple yes and leaning there has killed a patch of dried bark said the angel see how dried it appears freckles stared at her angel he shouted i bet you it's a marked tree course it is cried the angel no one would cut that sapling and carry it away there and lean it up for nothing i'll tell you this is one of jack's marked trees he's climbed up there above anyone's head peeled the bark and cut into the grain enough to be sure then he's laid the bark back and fastened it with that pole to mark it you see there're a lot of other big maples close around it can you climb to that place yes said freckles if i take off my i can then take them off said the angel and do hurry can't you see that i am almost crazy to know if this tree is a marked one when they pushed the sapling over a piece of bark as big as the crown of freckles hat fell away i believe it looks kind of nubby encouraged the angel backing away with her face all screwed into a twist in an effort to intensify her vision freckles reached the opening then slid rapidly to the ground he was almost breathless while his eyes were flashing the bark's been cut clean with a knife the sap scraped away and a big chip taken out deep the trunk is the twistiest thing you ever saw it's full of eyes as a bird is of feathers the angel was dancing and shaking his hand oh freckles she cried i'm so delighted that you found it but i didn't said the astonished freckles that tree isn't my find it's yours i forgot it and was going on you wouldn't give up and kept talking about it and turned back you found it you'd best be looking after your reputation for truth and veracity said the angel you know you saw that sapling first yes after you took me back and set me looking for it scoffed freckles the clear ringing echo of strongly swung axes came crashing through the limberlost tis the gang shouted freckles they're clearing a place to make the camp let's go help hadn't we better mark that tree again cautioned the angel it's away in here there's such a lot of them and all so much alike we'd feel good and green to find it and then lose it xiv wolf on the anniversary of the night mescal disappeared the mysterious voice which had called to hare so often and so strangely again pierced his slumber and brought him bolt upright in his bed shuddering and listening the dark room was as quiet as a tomb he fell back into his blankets trembling with emotion sleep did not close his eyes again that night he lay in a fever waiting for the dawn and when the gray gloom lightened he knew what he must do after breakfast he sought august naab may i go across the river he asked the old man looked up from his carpenter's task and fastened his glance on hare mescal yes i saw it long ago he shook his head and spread his great hands there's no use for me to say what the desert is if you ever come back you'll bring her yes you may go it's a man's deed god keep you hare spoke to no other person he filled one with grain another with meat bread and dried fruits strapped a leather back of silvermane's saddle and set out toward the river at the he removed silvermane's equipments and placed them in the boat at that moment a long howl as of a dog baying the moon startled him from his musings and his eyes sought the up and down and then the opposite side an animal which at first he took to be a gray was running along the of the landing pretty white for a wolf he muttered might be a navajo dog the beast sat down on his haunches and lifting a lean head sent up a doleful howl then he began trotting along the bar every few paces stepping to the edge of the water presently he spied hare and he began to bark furiously it's a dog all right wants to get across said hare where have i seen him suddenly he sprang to his feet almost upsetting the boat he's like mescal's wolf he looked closer his heart beginning to thump and then he yelled wolf hyer hyer the dog leaped straight up in the air and coming down began to dash back and forth along the sand with piercing yelps it's wolf mescal must be near cried hare a veil obscured his sight and every vein was like a hot cord wolf wolf i'm coming with trembling hands he tied silvermane's bridle to the stern seat of the boat and pushed off in his eagerness he rowed too hard dragging silvermane's nose under water and he had to check himself time and again he turned to call to the dog at length the bow grated on the sand and silvermane emerged with a splash and a snort wolf old fellow cried hare where's mescal wolf where is she he threw his arms around the dog wolf whined licked hare's face and breaking away ran up the sandy trail and back again but he barked no more he waited to see if hare was following all right wolf coming never had hare saddled so speedily nor mounted so quickly he sent silvermane into the trail close behind the dog up on the rocky bench and then under the bulging wall wolf reached the level between the canyon and echo cliffs and then started straight west toward the painted desert he trotted a few rods and turned to see if the man was coming doubt fear uncertainty ceased for hare with the first blast of dust scented air in his face he knew wolf was leading him to mescal he knew that the cry he had heard in his dream was hers that the old mysterious promise of the desert had at last begun its fulfilment he gave one sharp exultant answer to that call the horizon lay before him and the treeless plains the slopes the sandy stretches the massed blocks of black mesas all seemed to welcome him his soul sang within him for mescal was there far away she must be a mere grain of sand in all that world of drifting sands perhaps ill perhaps hurt but alive waiting for him calling for him crying out with a voice that no distance could silence he did not see the sharp peaks as pitiless barriers nor the mesas and domes as death nor the sands as foes to plant and beast and man that painted wonderland had sheltered mescal for a year he had loved it for its color its change its secrecy he loved it now because it had not been a grave for mescal but a home therefore he laughed at the deceiving yellow distances in the foreground of glistening mesas at the deceiving purple distances of the horizon the wind blew a song in his ears the dry desert odors were fragrance in his nostrils the sand tasted sweet between his teeth and the quivering veiling the desert in transparent haze framed beautiful pictures for his eyes wolf kept to the fore for some thirty paces and though he had ceased to stop he still looked back to see if the horse and man were following hare had noted the dog occasionally in the first hours of travel but he had given his eyes mostly to the broken line of sky and desert in the west to the receding contour of echo cliffs to the spread and break of the desert near at hand here and there life showed itself in a gaunt coyote sneaking into the cactus or a horned toad huddling down in the dust or a lizard sunning himself upon a stone it was only when his excited fancy had cooled that hare came to look closely at wolf but for the dog's color he could not have been distinguished from a real wolf his head and ears and tail drooped and he was lame in his right front paw love paul had been many times up to willey farm during the autumn he was friends with the two youngest boys edgar the eldest would not condescend at first and miriam also refused to be approached she was afraid of being set at nought as by her own brothers the girl was romantic in her soul everywhere was a walter scott heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps she herself was something of a princess turned into a in her own imagination and she was afraid lest this boy who nevertheless looked something like a walter scott hero who could paint and speak french and knew what algebra meant and who went by train to nottingham every day might consider her simply as the unable to perceive the princess beneath so she held aloof her great companion was her mother they were both and inclined to be mystical such women as treasure religion inside them breathe it in their nostrils and see the whole of life in a mist thereof so to miriam christ and god made one great figure which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset burned out the western sky and ediths and lucys and rowenas brian de bois guilberts rob roys and guy mannerings rustled the sunny leaves in the morning or sat in her bedroom aloft alone when it snowed that was life to her for the rest she drudged in the house which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been mucked up immediately by the trampling of her brothers she madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe him and stifle him in her love she went to church reverently with bowed head and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the other and from the voice of the curate she fought with her brothers whom she considered brutal louts and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart but only wanted to have as easy a time as he could and his meals when he was ready for them she hated her position as she wanted to be considered she wanted to learn thinking that if she could read as paul said he could read colomba or the voyage autour de ma chambre the world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect she could not be princess by wealth or standing so she was mad to have learning whereon to pride herself for she was different from other folk and must not be scooped up among the common fry learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire her beauty that of a shy wild quiveringly sensitive thing seemed nothing to her even her soul so strong for rhapsody was not enough she must have something to reinforce her pride because she felt different from other people paul she eyed rather wistfully on the whole she scorned the male sex but here was a new specimen quick light graceful who could be gentle and who could be sad and who was clever and who knew a lot and who had a death in the family the poor morsel of learning exalted him almost in her esteem yet she tried hard to scorn him because he would not see in her the princess but only the and he scarcely observed her then he was so ill and she felt he would be weak then she would be stronger than he then she could love him if she could be mistress of him in his weakness take care of him if he could depend on her if she could as it were have him in her arms how she would love him as soon as the skies brightened and was out paul drove off in the heavy float up to willey farm mr leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy then clicked to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly in the freshness of the morning white clouds went on their way crowding to the back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime the water of nethermere lay below very blue against the seared meadows and the it was four and a half miles drive tiny buds on the hedges vivid as were opening into rosettes and thrushes called and blackbirds shrieked and scolded it was a new glamorous world miriam peeping through the kitchen window saw the horse walk through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the still bare then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down he put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the ruddy farmer handed down to him miriam appeared in the doorway she was nearly sixteen very beautiful with her warm colouring her gravity her eyes dilating suddenly like an ecstasy i say said paul turning shyly aside your daffodils are nearly out it early but they look cold cold said miriam in her musical caressing voice the man who died i returned from the city about three on that may afternoon pretty well disgusted with life i had been three months in the old country and was fed up with it if anyone had told me a year ago that i would have been feeling like that i should have laughed at him but there was the fact the weather made me liverish the talk of the ordinary englishman made me sick i get enough exercise and the amusements of london seemed as flat as that has been standing in the sun richard hannay i kept telling myself you have got into the wrong ditch my friend and you had better climb out it made me bite my lips to think of the plans i had been building up those last years in buluwayo i had got my pile not one of the big ones but good enough for me and i had figured out all kinds of ways of enjoying myself my father had brought me out from scotland at the age of six and i had never been home since so england was a sort of arabian nights to me and i counted on stopping there for the rest of my days but from the first i was disappointed with it in about a week i was tired of seeing sights and in less than a month i had had enough of restaurants and theatres and i had no real pal to go about with which probably explains things plenty of people invited me to their houses but they seem much interested in me they would fling me a question or two about south africa and then get on to their own affairs a lot of imperialist ladies asked me to tea to meet schoolmasters from new zealand and editors from vancouver and that was the dismalest business of all here was i years old sound in wind and limb with enough money to have a good time yawning my head off all day i had just about settled to clear out and get back to the veld for i was the best bored man in the united kingdom that afternoon i had been worrying my brokers about investments to give my mind something to work on and on my way home i turned into my club rather a which took in colonial members i had a long drink and read the evening papers they were full of the row in the near east and there was an article about karolides the greek premier i rather fancied the chap from all accounts he seemed the one big man in the show and he played a straight game too which was more than could be said for most of them i gathered that they hated him pretty blackly in berlin and vienna but that we were going to stick by him and one paper said that he was the only barrier between europe and armageddon i remember wondering if i could get a job in those parts it struck me that albania was the sort of place that might keep a man from yawning about six i went home dressed dined at the café royal and turned into a it was a silly show all capering women and men and i did not stay long the night was fine and clear as i walked back to the flat i had hired near portland place the crowd surged past me on the pavements busy and chattering and i envied the people for having something to do these and clerks and dandies and policemen had some interest in life that kept them going i gave to a beggar because i saw him yawn he was a at oxford circus i looked up into the spring sky and i made a vow i would give the old country another day to fit me into something if nothing happened i would take the next boat for the cape my flat was the first floor in a new block behind langham place there was a common staircase with a porter and a liftman at the entrance but there was no restaurant or anything of that sort and each flat was quite shut off from the others i hate servants on the premises so i had a fellow to look after me who came in by the day he arrived before eight every morning and used to depart at seven for i never dined at home i was just fitting my key into the door when i noticed a man at my elbow i had not seen him approach and the sudden appearance made me start he was a slim man with a short brown beard and small gimlety blue eyes i recognized him as the occupant of a flat on the top floor with whom i had passed the time of day on the stairs can i speak to you he said may i come in for a minute he was steadying his voice with an effort and his hand was pawing my arm i got my door open and motioned him in no sooner was he over the threshold than he made a dash for my back room where i used to smoke and write my letters then he bolted back iv the work which had called clay to the mines kept him there for some time and it was not until the third day after the arrival of the langhams that he returned again to the palms on the afternoon when he climbed the hill to the bungalow he found the langhams as he had left them with the difference that king now occupied a place in the family circle clay was made so welcome and especially so by king that he felt rather ashamed of his sentiments toward him and considered his three days of absence to be well repaid by the heartiness of their greeting for myself said mr langham i don't believe you had anything to do at the mines at all i think you went away just to show us how necessary you are but if you want me to make a good report of our resident director on my return you had better devote yourself less to the mines while you are here and more to us clay said he was glad to find that his duties were to be of so pleasant a nature and asked them what they had seen and what they had done they told him they had been nowhere but had waited for his return in order that he might act as their guide then you should see the city at once said clay and i will have the volante brought to the door and we can all go in this afternoon there is room for the four of you inside and i can sit on the with the driver no said king let hope or me sit on the then we can practise our spanish on the driver not very well clay replied for the driver sits on the first horse like a postilion it's a sort of tandem without reins haven't you seen it yet we consider the volante our proudest exhibit so clay ordered the volante to be brought out and placed them facing each other in the open carriage while he climbed to the from which position of vantage he pointed out and explained the objects of interest they passed after the manner of a professional guide it was a warm beautiful afternoon and the clear mists of the atmosphere intensified the rich blue of the sky and the brilliant colors of the houses and the different shades of green of the trees and bushes that lined the highroad to the capital to the right as we descend said clay speaking over his shoulder you see a tin house it is the home of the resident director of the olancho mining company limited and of his able lieutenants mr theodore langham and mr macwilliams the building on the extreme left is the in which mr macwilliams stores his three locomotive engines and in the far is mr macwilliams himself in the act of repairing a he is the one in a suit of blue overalls and as his language at such times is free we will drive rapidly on and not embarrass him besides added the engineer with the happy laugh of a boy who had been treated to a holiday i am sure that i am not setting him the example of fixity to duty which he should expect from his chief they passed between high hedges of spanish bayonet and came to mud cabins thatched with and alive with naked little children who laughed and cheered to them as they passed it's a very beautiful country for the pueblo was clay's comment different parts of the same tree furnish them with food shelter and clothing and the sun gives them fuel and the government changes so often that they can always dodge the from the mud cabins they came to more substantial houses of adobe with the walls painted in two distinct colors blue pink or yellow with roofs and the names with which they had been christened in bold black letters above the entrances then the carriage rattled over paved streets and they drove between houses of two stories painted more decorously in pink and light blue with windows guarded by heavy bars of finely wrought iron and ornamented with scrollwork in stucco the principal streets were given up to stores and cafés all wide open to the pavement and protected from the sun by brilliantly striped awnings and gay with the national colors of olancho in flags and streamers in front of them sat officers in uniform and the dandies of valencia in white duck suits and panama hats toying with tortoise shell canes which could be converted if the occasion demanded into blades of toledo steel in the streets were priests and mule drivers and ragged ranchmen with cloaks hanging to their sandals and negro women with bare shoulders and long trains vending lottery tickets and rolling huge cigars between their lips it was an old story to clay and king but none of the others had seen a city before they were familiar with the far east and the mediterranean but not with the fierce hot tropics of their sister continent and so their eyes were wide open and they kept calling continually to one another to notice some new place or figure a terrible loss there could be no doubt of the fact princess ozma the lovely girl ruler of the fairyland of oz was lost she had completely disappeared not one of her subjects not even her closest friends knew what had become of her it was dorothy who first discovered it dorothy was a little kansas girl who had come to the land of oz to live and had been given a delightful suite of rooms in ozma's royal palace just because ozma loved dorothy and wanted her to live as near her as possible so the two girls might be much together dorothy was not the only girl from the outside world who had been welcomed to oz and lived in the royal palace there was another named betsy bobbin whose adventures had led her to seek refuge with ozma and still another named trot who had been invited together with her faithful companion cap'n bill to make her home in this wonderful fairyland the three girls all had rooms in the palace and were great chums but dorothy was the dearest friend of their gracious ruler and only she at any hour dared to seek ozma in her royal apartments for dorothy had lived in oz much longer than the other girls and had been made a princess of the realm betsy was a year older than dorothy and trot was a year younger yet the three were near enough of an age to become great playmates and to have nice times together it was while the three were talking together one morning in dorothy's room that betsy proposed they make a journey into the munchkin country which was one of the four great countries of the land of oz ruled by ozma i've never been there yet said betsy bobbin but the scarecrow once told me it is the prettiest country in all oz i'd like to go too added trot all right said dorothy i'll go and ask ozma perhaps she will let us take the sawhorse and the red wagon which would be much nicer for us than having to walk all the way this land of oz is a pretty big place when you get to all the edges of it so she jumped up and went along the halls of the splendid palace until she came to the royal suite which filled all the front of the second floor in a little waiting room sat ozma's maid jellia jamb who was busily sewing is ozma up yet inquired dorothy i don't know my dear replied jellia i haven't heard a word from her this morning she hasn't even called for her bath or her breakfast and it is far past her usual time for them that's strange exclaimed the little girl yes agreed the maid but of course no harm could have happened to her no one can die or be killed in the land of oz and ozma is herself a powerful fairy and she has no enemies so far as we know therefore i am not at all worried about her though i must admit her silence is unusual perhaps said dorothy thoughtfully she has overslept or she may be reading or working out some new sort of magic to do good to her people any of these things may be true replied jellia jamb so i haven't dared disturb our royal mistress you however are a privileged character princess and i am sure that ozma wouldn't mind at all if you went in to see her of course not said dorothy and opening the door of the outer chamber she went in all was still here she walked into another room which was ozma's boudoir and then pushing back a heavy drapery richly broidered with threads of pure gold the girl entered the of the fairy ruler of oz the bed of ivory and gold was vacant the room was vacant not a trace of ozma was to be found very much surprised yet still with no fear that anything had happened to her friend dorothy returned through the boudoir to the other rooms of the suite she went into the music room the library the laboratory the bath the wardrobe and even into the great throne room which adjoined the royal suite but in none of these places could she find ozma so she returned to the anteroom where she had left the maid jellia jamb and said she isn't in her rooms now so she must have gone out i don't understand how she could do that without my seeing her replied jellia unless she made herself invisible she isn't there anyhow declared dorothy then let us go find her suggested the maid who appeared to be a little uneasy so they went into the corridors and there dorothy almost stumbled over a queer girl who was dancing lightly along the passage stop a minute scraps she called have you seen ozma this morning not i replied the queer girl dancing nearer i lost both my eyes in a tussle with the woozy last night for the creature scraped em both off my face with his square paws so i put the eyes in my pocket and this morning led me to aunt em who sewed em on again so i've seen nothing at all today except during the last five minutes so of course i haven't seen ozma xix the feast's end the feast was a noble feast as has already been said there was an elegant ingenuity displayed in the form of pies which delighted my heart once acknowledge that an american pie is far to be preferred to its humble ancestor the english tart and it is joyful to be reassured at a bowden reunion that invention has not yet failed beside a delightful variety of material the decorations went beyond all my former experience dates and names were wrought in lines of pastry and frosting on the tops there was even more elaborate reading matter on an excellent pie which we began to share and eat precept upon precept mrs todd helped me generously to the whole word bowden and consumed reunion herself save an undecipherable fragment but the most renowned essay in cookery on the tables was a model of the old bowden house made of durable gingerbread with all the windows and doors in the right places and sprigs of genuine lilac set at the front it must have been baked in sections in one of the last of the great brick ovens and fastened together on the morning of the day there was a general sigh when this fell into ruin at the feast's end and it was shared by a great part of the assembly not without seriousness and as if it were a pledge and token of loyalty i met the maker of the gingerbread house which had called up lively remembrances of a childish story she had the gleaming eye of an enthusiast and a look of high ideals i could just as well have made it all of frosted cake she said but twouldn't have been the right shade the old house as you observe was never painted and i concluded that plain gingerbread would represent it best it wasn't all i expected it would be she said sadly as many an artist had said before her of his work there were speeches by the ministers and there proved to be a historian among the bowdens who gave some fine anecdotes of the family history and then appeared a poetess whom mrs todd regarded with wistful compassion and indulgence and when the long faded garland of verses came to an appealing end she turned to me with words of praise sounded pretty said the generous listener yes i thought she did very well we went to school together an mary anna had a very hard time trouble was her mother thought she'd given birth to a genius an mary anna's come to believe it herself there i don't know what we should have done without her there ain't nobody else that can write poetry between here and way up towards rockland it adds a great deal at such a time when she speaks o those that are gone she feels it all and so does everybody else but she harps too much i'd laid half of that away for next time if i was mary anna there comes mother to speak to her an old mr gilbreath's sister now she'll be heartened right up mother'll say just the right thing the were as affecting as the meetings of these old friends had been there were enough young persons at the reunion but it is the old who really value such opportunities as for the young it is the habit of every day to meet their comrades the time of separation has not come to see the joy with which these elder kinsfolk and acquaintances had looked in one another's faces and the lingering touch of their friendly hands to see these affectionate meetings and then the reluctant partings gave one a new idea of the isolation in which it was possible to live in that after all thinly settled region they did not expect to see one another again very soon the steady hard work on the farms the difficulty of getting from place to place especially in winter when boats were laid up gave double value to any occasion which could bring a large number of families together even funerals in this country of the pointed firs were not without their social advantages and satisfactions i heard the words next summer repeated many times though summer was still ours and all the leaves were green the boats began to put out from shore and the wagons to drive away mrs blackett took me into the old house when we came back from the grove it was her father's birthplace and early home and she had spent much of her own childhood there with her grandmother she spoke of those days as if they had but lately passed in fact i could imagine that the house looked almost exactly the same to her i could see the brown rafters of the unfinished roof as i looked up the steep staircase though the best room was as handsome with its good wainscoting and touch of ornament on the cornice as any old room of its day in a town some of the guests who came from a distance were still sitting in the best room when we went in to take leave of the master and mistress of the house we all said eagerly what a pleasant day it had been and how swiftly the time had passed perhaps it is the great national anniversaries which our country has lately kept and the soldiers meetings that take place everywhere which have made reunions of every sort the fashion this one at least had been very interesting i fancied that old feuds had been overlooked and the old saying that blood is thicker than water had again proved itself true though from the variety of names one argued a certain adulteration of the bowden traits and belongings clannishness is an instinct of the heart it is more than a birthright or a custom and lesser rights were forgotten in the claim to a common inheritance hearts and other hearts stephen had brought a change of clothes as he had a habit of being ducked once at least during the day and since there was a halt in the proceedings and no need of his services for an hour or two he found rose and walked with her to a secluded spot where they could watch the logs and not be seen by the people you frightened everybody almost to death jumping into the river chided rose stephen laughed they thought i was a fool to save a fool i suppose perhaps not as bad as that but it did seem reckless i know and the boy no doubt would be better off dead but so should i be if i could have let him die rose regarded this strange point of view for a moment and then silently acquiesced in it she was constantly doing this and she often felt that her mental horizon broadened in the act but she could not be sure that stephen grew any dearer to her because of his moral altitudes besides stephen argued i happened to be nearest to the river and it was my job how do you always happen to be nearest to the people in trouble and why is it always your job if there are any rewards for good conduct being distributed i'm right in line with my hand stretched out stephen replied with meaning in his voice rose blushed under her flowery hat as he led the way to a bench under a sycamore tree that overhung the water she had almost convinced herself that she was as much in love with stephen waterman as it was in her nature to be with anybody he was handsome in his big way kind generous temperate well educated and no fault could be found with his family for his mother had been a teacher and his father though a farmer a college graduate stephen himself had had one year at bowdoin but had been recalled as the head of the house when his father died that was a severe blow but his mother's death three years after was a grief never to be quite forgotten rose too was the child of a gently bred mother and all her instincts were refined yes stephen in himself satisfied her in all the larger wants of her nature but she had an unsatisfied hunger for the world the world of portland where her cousins lived or better still the world of boston of which she heard through mrs wealthy brooks whose nephew claude often came to visit her in edgewood life on a farm a mile and a half distant from and stores life in the house with rufus who was rumored to be somewhat wild and unsteady this prospect seemed a trifle dull and uneventful to the trivial part of her though to the better part it was enough the better part of her loved stephen waterman dimly feeling the richness of his nature the tenderness of his affection the strength of his character rose was not destitute either of imagination or sentiment she did not relish this constant weighing of stephen in the balance he was too good to be weighed and considered she longed to be carried out of herself on a wave of rapturous assent but something seemed to hold her back some seed of discontent with the man's environment and circumstances some germ of longing for a gayer brighter more varied life no amount of or argument could change the situation she always loved stephen more or less more when he was away from her because she never approved his collars nor the set of his shirt bosom and as he naturally wore these despised articles of apparel whenever he proposed to her she was always lukewarm about marrying him and settling down on the river farm still she discovered in herself with positive gratitude a warmer feeling for him than she had experienced before he wore a new and becoming gray flannel shirt with the soft turnover collar that belonged to it and a blue tie the color of his kind eyes she knew that he had shaved his beard at her request not long ago and that when she did not like the effect as much as she had hoped he had meekly grown a mustache for her sake it did seem as if a man could hardly do more to please an exacting and she had admired him unreservedly when he pulled off his boots and jumped into the river to save alcestis crambry's life without giving a single thought to his own and was there ever after all such a noble devoted unselfish fellow or a better brother and would she not despise herself for rejecting him simply because he was countrified and because she longed to see the world of the in the magazines the logs are so like people she exclaimed as they sat down i could name nearly every one of them for somebody in the village look at mite shapley that dancing little

keenly and closely by intelligences greater than and yet as mortal as his own that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water with infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs serene in their assurance of their empire over matter it is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same no one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable it is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days at most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon mars perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise yet across the gulf of space minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us and early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment the planet mars i scarcely need remind the reader revolves about the sun at a mean distance of miles and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world it must be if the nebular hypothesis has any truth older than our world and long before this earth ceased to be molten life upon its surface must have begun its course the fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin it has air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence yet so vain is man and so blinded by his vanity that no writer up to the very end of the nineteenth century expressed any idea that intelligent life might have developed there far or indeed at all beyond its earthly level nor was it generally understood that since mars is older than our earth with scarcely a quarter of the superficial area and remoter from the sun it necessarily follows that it is not only more distant from beginning but nearer its end the secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already gone far indeed with our neighbour its physical condition is still largely a mystery but we know now that even in its equatorial region the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter its air is much more attenuated than ours its oceans have shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface and as its slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically inundate its temperate zones that last stage of exhaustion which to us is still incredibly remote has become a problem for the inhabitants of mars the immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects enlarged their powers and hardened their hearts and looking across space with instruments and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of they see at its nearest distance only of miles sunward of them a morning star of hope our own warmer planet green with vegetation and grey with water with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow seas and we men the creatures who inhabit this earth must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us the intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon mars their world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals to carry warfare sunward is indeed their only escape from the destruction that generation after generation creeps upon them how the grand gallipoot joined the nomes after leaving the whimsies guph continued on his journey and penetrated far into the northwest he wanted to get to the country of the growleywogs and in order to do that he must cross the ripple land which was a hard thing to do for the ripple land was a succession of hills and valleys all very steep and rocky and they changed places constantly by rippling while guph was climbing a hill it sank down under him and became a valley and while he was descending into a valley it rose up and carried him to the top of a hill this was very perplexing to the traveler and a stranger might have thought he could never cross the ripple land at all but guph knew that if he kept steadily on he would get to the end at last so he paid no attention to the changing hills and valleys and plodded along as calmly as if walking upon the level ground the result of this wise persistence was that the general finally reached firmer soil and after penetrating a dense forest came to the dominion of the growleywogs no sooner had he crossed the border of this domain when two guards seized him and carried him before the grand gallipoot of the growleywogs who scowled upon him ferociously and asked him why he dared intrude upon his territory i'm the lord high general of the invincible army of the nomes and my name is guph was the reply all the world trembles when that name is mentioned the growleywogs gave a shout of jeering laughter at this and one of them caught the nome in his strong arms and tossed him high into the air guph was considerably shaken when he fell upon the hard ground but he appeared to take no notice of the impertinence and composed himself to speak again to the grand gallipoot my master king roquat the red has sent me here to confer with you he wishes your assistance to conquer the land of oz here the general paused and the grand gallipoot scowled upon him more terribly than ever and said go on the voice of the grand gallipoot was partly a roar and partly a growl he mumbled his words badly and guph had to listen carefully in order to understand him these growleywogs were certainly remarkable creatures they were of gigantic size yet were all bone and skin and muscle there being no meat or fat upon their bodies at all their powerful muscles lay just underneath their skins like bunches of tough rope and the weakest growleywog was so strong that he could pick up an elephant and toss it seven miles away it seems unfortunate that strong people are usually so disagreeable and overbearing that no one cares for them in fact to be different from your fellow creatures is always a misfortune the growleywogs knew that they were disliked and avoided by every one so they had become surly and unsociable even among themselves guph knew that they hated all people including the nomes but he hoped to win them over nevertheless and knew that if he succeeded they would afford him very powerful assistance the land of oz is ruled by a girl who is disgustingly kind and good he continued her people are all happy and contented and have no care or worries whatever go on growled the grand gallipoot once the nome king enslaved the royal family of ev another lot that we detest said the general but ozma interfered although it was none of her business and marched her army against us with her was a kansas girl named dorothy and a yellow hen and they marched directly into the nome king's cavern there they liberated our slaves from ev and stole king roquat's magic belt which they carried away with them so now our king is making a tunnel under the deadly desert so we can march through it to the emerald city when we get there we mean to conquer and destroy all the land and recapture the magic belt again he paused and again the grand gallipoot growled go on guph tried to think what to say next and a happy thought soon occurred to him we want you to help us in this conquest he announced for we need the mighty aid of the growleywogs in order to make sure that we shall not be defeated you are the strongest people in all the world and you hate good and happy creatures as much as we nomes do i am sure it will be a real pleasure to you to tear down the beautiful emerald city and in return for your valuable assistance we will allow you to bring back to your country ten thousand people of oz to be your slaves twenty thousand growled the grand gallipoot all right we promise you twenty thousand agreed the general the gallipoot made a signal and at once his attendants picked up general guph and carried him away to a prison where the jailer amused himself by sticking pins in the round fat body of the old nome to see him jump and hear him yell introduction to the bride of lammermoor the author on a former occasion declined giving the real source from which he drew the tragic subject of this history because though occurring at a distant period it might possibly be unpleasing to the feelings of the descendants of the parties but as he finds an account of the circumstances given in the notes to law's memorials by his ingenious friend charles kirkpatrick sharpe esq and also indicated in his reprint of the rev mr symson's poems appended to the large description of galloway as the original of the bride of lammermoor the author feels himself now at liberty to tell the tale as he had it from connexions of his own who lived very near the period and were closely related to the family of the bride it is well known that the family of dalrymple which has produced within the space of two centuries as many men of talent civil and military and of literary political and professional eminence as any house in scotland first rose into distinction in the person of james dalrymple one of the most eminent lawyers that ever lived though the labours of his powerful mind were unhappily exercised on a subject so limited as scottish jurisprudence on which he has composed an admirable work he married margaret daughter to ross of balneel with whom he obtained a considerable estate she was an able politic and woman so successful in what she undertook that the vulgar no way partial to her husband or her family imputed her success to necromancy according to the popular belief this dame margaret purchased the temporal prosperity of her family from the master whom she served under a singular condition which is thus narrated by the historian of her grandson the great earl of stair she lived to a great age and at her death desired that she might not be put under ground but that her coffin should stand upright on one end of it promising that while she remained in that situation the dalrymples should continue to flourish what was the old lady's motive for the request or whether she really made such a promise i shall not take upon me to determine but it's certain her coffin stands upright in the isle of the church of kirklistown the belonging to the family the talents of this accomplished race were sufficient to have accounted for the dignities which many members of the family attained without any supernatural assistance but their extraordinary prosperity was attended by some equally singular family misfortunes of which that which befell their eldest daughter was at once unaccountable and melancholy miss janet dalrymple daughter of the first lord stair and dame margaret ross had engaged herself without the knowledge of her parents to the lord rutherford who was not acceptable to them either on account of his political principles or his want of fortune the young couple broke a piece of gold together and pledged their troth in the most solemn manner and it is said the young lady imprecated dreadful evils on herself should she break her plighted faith shortly after a suitor who was favoured by lord stair and still more so by his lady paid his addresses to miss dalrymple the young lady refused the proposal and being pressed on the subject confessed her secret engagement lady stair a woman accustomed to universal submission for even her husband did not dare to contradict her treated this objection as a trifle and insisted upon her daughter yielding her consent to marry the new suitor david dunbar son and heir to david dunbar of baldoon in wigtonshire the first lover a man of very high spirit then interfered by letter and insisted on the right he had acquired by his troth plighted with the young lady lady stair sent him for answer that her daughter sensible of her undutiful behaviour in entering into a contract unsanctioned by her parents had retracted her unlawful vow and now refused to fulfil her engagement with him the lover in return declined positively to receive such an answer from any one but his mistress in person and as she had to deal with a man who was both of a most determined character and of too high condition to be trifled with lady stair was obliged to consent to an interview between lord rutherford and her daughter but she took care to be present in person and argued the point with the disappointed and incensed lover with pertinacity equal to his own she particularly insisted on the levitical law which declares that a woman shall be free of a vow which her parents dissent from this is the passage of scripture she founded on if a man vow a vow unto the lord or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth if a woman also vow a vow unto the lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house in her youth and her father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand war and art this war is going to have a tremendous in fluence on art vitalize it you know and make it real and all that sort of thing in fact it's doing it already we took up the war last night our little group of serious thinkers you know in quite a serious way and considered it thoroughly in all its aspects and we decided that it would put more soul into art and into life too you know already you can see it on every hand how much serious purpose it is putting into lives that were merely trivial before even poor dear mamma and really it would be hard to imagine a more trivial person than mamma is knitting socks she is going to send them to the poles she wanted to send them to the belgians but i said to her positively mamma you are always behind the times don't you know the belgians are going out and the poles are coming in and you know it's been months since really smart people have knit for the belgians the poles are quite the thing now it's strange how great movements keep going on and on from mountain peak to mountain peak of usefulness like that isn't it changing their direction now and then as evolution itself does but always progressing progressing that is one wonderful thing about evolution it always progresses when one thinks it over one grows more and more conscious that the human race owes a great deal to evolution doesn't one what could we have done without it it's as somebody said about something else one time if we hadn't had it you know it would have been necessary to invent it though for the life of me i can't remember who it was or what he said about it although likely it was madame de stael we took her up once and it developed that she had said a most surprising number of things like that things you know that would be quite quotable if you could only remember them isn't memory a wonderful facility though i've always intended to go in for developing mine systematically and scientifically but i've never done it because i always forget whether i should order the people to send home a work on numismatics or a work on mnemonics one of them is about money you know and the other is about memory and once when i was shopping and thought i had it right it turned out the book did when i got it home to be all about air and things pneumatics you know wasn't it perfectly ridiculous but of course one learns by one's mistakes have you seen dear nijinsky we were discussing him last evening our little group you know and decided that while he has more personality than mordkin he has less temperament if you get what i mean one of the girls said last evening mordkin is more exotic but nijinsky is more esoteric and another said one of them shows intellect obviously mingled with spirit but the other shows spirit occultly mingled with intellect fothergil finch said they are alike in their differences but subtly differentiated in their likenesses pas fothy has a simply delightful faculty of summing a thing up in a sentence like that but it makes him very vain if you show you think so so i put him in his place and closed the discussion with one remark it is all i said it is all a question of interpretation and quite seriously when you come to think about it it usually is isn't it a spiritual dialogue last night i met hermione and eagerly she said to me thoughts from the ambient everywhere electrify our worldly air my soul i said grabs off such hints as butter whether pats or prints receives and holds all unaware small strands of drifting golden hair but have you thought o maiden fair o have you thought profoundly of the psychic consciousness in crows or why the malay when in love wears rubber earrings on his toes the lady shook her lovely head twas coiffed divinely and she said have you reflected on the part primeval instinct plays in art it's simply wonderful the way old things grow new from day to day that's true i said i often ape the ape to get my art in shape and with the simian going strong behold another rennysawng perhaps she said across the verge of darkness from the cosmic urge the light is speeding in bright waves e'en now to show the way to slaves the thought i said is cheerful but these swamis will chew alas she said alas too true but oh it's wonderful of you to sympathize and understand she gestured with a jeweled hand the joy of being understood our talk i said has done me good will the best people receive the superman socially we've been taking up metabolism lately our little group of serious thinkers you know and it's wonderful just simply wonderful i really don't know how i got along for so many years without it it opens up such new vistas doesn't it i can never think in the same way again about even the most trivial things since i have learned all about protoplasm and and well all these marvelous scientific things you know youth this could have occurred nowhere but in england where men and sea interpenetrate so to speak the sea entering into the life of most men and the men knowing something or everything about the sea in the way of amusement of travel or of we were sitting round a mahogany table that reflected the bottle the and our faces as we leaned on our elbows there was a director of companies an accountant a lawyer marlow and myself the director had been a conway boy the accountant had served four years at sea the lawyer a fine crusted tory high churchman the best of old fellows the soul of honour had been chief officer in the p o service in the good old days when were at least on two masts and used to come down the china sea before a fair monsoon with set alow and aloft we all began life in the merchant service between the five of us there was the strong bond of the sea and also the fellowship of the craft which no amount of enthusiasm for yachting cruising and so on can give since one is only the amusement of life and the other is life itself marlow at least i think that is how he spelt his name told the story or rather the chronicle of a voyage yes i have seen a little of the eastern seas but what i remember best is my first voyage there you fellows know there are those voyages that seem ordered for the illustration of life that might stand for a symbol of existence you fight work sweat nearly kill yourself sometimes do kill yourself trying to accomplish something and you not from any fault of yours you simply can do nothing neither great nor little not a thing in the world not even marry an old maid or get a wretched cargo of coal to its port of destination it was altogether a memorable affair it was my first voyage to the east and my first voyage as second mate it was also my first command admit it was time he was sixty if a day a little man with a broad not very straight back with bowed shoulders and one leg more bandy than the other he had that queer appearance you see so often in men who work in the fields he had a face chin and nose trying to come together over a sunken mouth and it was framed in fluffy hair that looked like a chin strap of sprinkled with and he had blue eyes in that old face of his which were amazingly like a with that candid expression some quite common men preserve to the end of their days by a rare internal gift of simplicity of heart and rectitude of soul what induced him to accept me was a wonder i had come out of a crack australian clipper where i had been third officer and he seemed to have a prejudice against crack clippers as aristocratic and he said to me you know in this ship you will have to work i said i had to work in every ship i had ever been in ah but this is different and you gentlemen out of them big ships but there i dare say you will do join i joined it was years ago and i was just twenty how time passes it was one of the happiest days of my life fancy second mate for the first time a really responsible officer i have thrown up my new billet for a fortune the mate looked me over carefully he was also an old chap but of another stamp he had a roman nose a long beard and his name was mahon but he insisted that it should be pronounced mann he was well connected yet there was something wrong with his luck and he had never got on as to the captain he had been for years in coasters then in the mediterranean and last in the west indian trade he had never been round the capes he could just write a kind of sketchy hand and care for writing at all both were thorough good seamen of course and between those two old chaps i felt like a small boy between two grandfathers the ship also was old her name was the judea queer name it she belonged to a man wilmer wilcox some name like that but he has been bankrupt and dead these twenty years or more and his name matter she had been laid up in shadwell basin for ever so long you may imagine her state she was all rust dust grime soot aloft dirt on deck to me it was like coming out of a palace into a ruined cottage she was about tons had a primitive windlass wooden latches to the doors not a bit of brass about her and a big square stern there was on it below her name in big letters a lot of scroll work with the gilt off and some sort of a coat of arms with the motto do or die underneath i remember it took my fancy immensely there was a touch of romance in it something that made me love the old thing something that appealed to my youth the amateur gardener the first step in amateur gardening is to sit down and consider what good you are going to get by it if you are only a tenant by the month as most people are it is obviously not of much use for you to plant a fruit orchard or an avenue of oak trees what you want is something that will grow quickly and will stand transplanting for when you move it would be a sin to leave behind you the plants on which you have spent so much labour and so much patent manure we knew a man once who was a bookmaker by trade and a leger bookmaker at that but had a passion for horses and flowers when he had a big win as he occasionally did it was his custom to have movable wooden stables built on skids put up in the yard and to have tons of the best soil that money could buy carted into the garden of the premises which he was occupying then he would keep splendid horses and grow rare roses and chrysanthemums his landlord passing by would see the garden in a blaze of colour and promise himself to raise the bookmaker's rent next quarter day however when the bookmaker took the knock as he invariably did at least twice a year it was his pleasing custom to move without giving notice he would hitch two to the stables and haul them right away at night he would not only dig up the roses trees and chrysanthemums he had planted but would also cart away the soil he had brought in in fact he used to shift the garden bodily he had one garden that he shifted to nearly every suburb in sydney and he always argued that the change of air was invaluable for chrysanthemums being determined then to go in for gardening on principles and having decided on the shrubs you mean to grow the next consideration is your chance of growing them if your neighbour keeps game fowls it may be taken for granted that before long they will pay you a visit and you will see the rooster scratching your pot plants out by the roots as if they were so much straw just to make a nice place to lie down and fluff the dust over himself goats will also stray in from the street and bite the young shoots off selecting the most valuable plants with a discrimination that would do credit to a professional gardener it is therefore useless to think of growing delicate or squeamish plants most amateur gardeners maintain a lifelong struggle against the devices of nature but when the forces of man and the forces of nature come into conflict nature wins every time nature has decreed that certain plants shall be hardy and therefore suitable to suburban amateur gardeners the suburban amateur gardener persists in trying to grow quite other plants and in despising those marked out by nature for his use it is to correct this tendency that this article is written the greatest standby to the amateur gardener should undoubtedly be the shrub known as plumbago this homely but hardy plant will grow anywhere it naturally prefers a good soil and a sufficient rainfall but if need be it will worry along without either fowls cannot scratch it up and even the goat turns away dismayed from its branches the flower is not strikingly beautiful nor ravishingly scented but it flowers nine months out of the year smothered with street dust and scorched by the summer sun you will find that faithful old plumbago plugging along undismayed a plant like this should be encouraged but the misguided amateur gardener as a rule despises it the plant known as the churchyard geranium is also one marked out by providence for the amateur so is cosmea which comes up year after year where once planted in creepers bignonia and lantana will hold their own under difficulties perhaps as well as any that can be found in trees the port jackson fig is a patriotic one to grow it is a fine plant to provide exercise as it sheds its leaves unsparingly and requires the whole garden to be swept up every day your aim as a student of nature should be to encourage the survival of the fittest there is a grass called nut grass and another called parramatta grass either of which holds its own against anything living or dead the average gardening manual gives you recipes for destroying these why should you destroy them in favour of a sickly plant that needs constant attention no the parramatta grass is the selected of nature and who are you to interfere with nature having decided to go in for strong simple plants that will hold their own and a bit over you must get your implements of husbandry the spade is the first thing but the average ironmonger will show you an unwieldy weapon only meant to be used by navvies don't buy it get a small spade about it is nice and light and doesn't tire the wrist and with it you can make a good display of enthusiasm and earn the hypocritical admiration of your wife after digging for or so get her to rub your back with any of the backache cures from that moment you will have no further need for the spade the burglars it was much too fine a night to think of going to bed at once and so although the witching hour of nine had struck edward and i were still leaning out of the open window in our nightshirts watching the play of the shadows on the moonlit lawn and planning schemes of fresh devilry for the sunshiny morrow from below strains of the jocund piano declared that the olympians were enjoying themselves in their listless impotent way for the new curate had been bidden to dinner that night and was at the moment unclerically proclaiming to all the world that he feared no foe his discordant vociferations doubtless started a train of thought in edward's mind for the youth presently remarked a propos of nothing that had been said before i believe the new curate's rather gone on aunt maria i scouted the notion why she's quite old i said she must have seen some summers of course she is replied edward scornfully it's not her it's her money he's after you bet didn't know she had any money i observed timidly sure to have said my brother with confidence heaps and heaps silence ensued both our minds being busy with the new situation thus presented mine in wonderment at this flaw that so often declared itself in enviable natures of fullest endowment in a man and a good cricketer for instance even as this curate edward's apparently in the consideration of how such a state of things supposing it existed could be best turned to his own advantage bobby ferris told me began edward in due course that there was a fellow spooning his sister once what's spooning i asked meekly oh i dunno said edward indifferently it's it's it's just a thing they do you know and he used to carry notes and messages and things between em and he got a shilling almost every time what from each of em i innocently inquired edward looked at me with scornful pity girls never have any money he briefly explained but she did his exercises and got him out of rows and told stories for him when he needed it and much better ones than he could have made up for himself girls are useful in some ways so he was living in clover when unfortunately they went and quarrelled about something don't see what that's got to do with it i said nor don't i rejoined edward but anyhow the notes and things stopped and so did the shillings bobby was fairly cornered for he had bought two ferrets on tick and promised to pay a shilling a week thinking the shillings were going on for ever the silly young ass so when the week was up and he was being dunned for the shilling he went off to the fellow and said your bella implores you to meet her at sundown by the hollow oak as of old be it only for a moment do not fail he got all that out of some rotten book of course the fellow looked puzzled and said what hollow oak i don't know any hollow oak perhaps it was the royal oak said bobby promptly cos he saw he had made a slip through trusting too much to the rotten book but this didn't seem to make the fellow any happier should think not i said the royal oak's an awful low sort of pub i know said edward well at last the fellow said i think i know what she means the hollow tree in your father's paddock it happens to be an elm but she wouldn't know the difference all right say i'll be there bobby hung about a bit for he hadn't got his money she was crying awfully he said then he got his shilling and wasn't the fellow riled i inquired when he got to the place and found nothing he found bobby said edward indignantly young ferris was a gentleman every inch of him he brought the fellow another message from bella i dare not leave the house my cruel parents immure me closely if you only knew what i suffer your bella out of the same rotten book this made the fellow a little suspicious cos it was the old ferrises who had been keen about the thing all through the fellow you see had tin but what's that got to i began again oh i dunno said edward impatiently i'm telling you just what bobby told me he got suspicious anyhow but he couldn't exactly call bella's brother a liar so bobby escaped for the time but when he was in a hole next week over a stiff french exercise and tried the same sort of game on his sister she was too sharp for him and he got caught out somehow women seem more mistrustful than men they're so beastly suspicious by nature you know i know said i but did the two the fellow and the sister make it up afterwards i don't remember about that replied edward indifferently but bobby got packed off to school a whole year earlier than his people meant to send him which was just what he wanted so you see it all came right in the end chapter xxviii how the comrades came over the marches of france after passing cahors the party branched away from the main road and leaving the river to the north of them followed a smaller track which wound over a vast and desolate plain this path led them amid marshes and woods until it brought them out into a glade with a broad stream swirling swiftly down the centre of it through this the horses splashed their way and on the farther shore sir nigel announced to them that they were now within the borders of the land of france for some miles they still followed the same lonely track which led them through a dense wood and then widening out curved down to an open rolling country such as they had traversed between aiguillon and cahors if it were grim and desolate upon the english border however what can describe the hideous barrenness of this ten times harried tract of france the whole face of the country was scarred and disfigured mottled over with the black blotches of burned and the gray gaunt of what had been chateaux broken fences crumbling walls vineyards littered with stones the shattered arches of bridges look where you might the signs of ruin and rapine met the eye here and there only on the farthest the gnarled turrets of a castle or the graceful pinnacles of church or of monastery showed where the forces of the sword or of the spirit had preserved some small islet of security in this universal flood of misery moodily and in silence the little party rode along the narrow and irregular track their hearts weighed down by this land of despair it was indeed a stricken and a blighted country and a man might have ridden from auvergne in the north to the marches of foix nor ever seen a smiling village or a thriving homestead from time to time as they advanced they saw strange lean figures scraping and scratching amid the weeds and thistles who on sight of the band of horsemen threw up their arms and dived in among the brushwood as shy and as swift as wild animals more than once however they came on families by the wayside who were too weak from hunger and disease to fly so that they could but sit like hares on a tussock with panting chests and terror in their eyes so gaunt were these poor folk so worn and spent with bent and knotted frames and sullen hopeless mutinous faces that it made the young englishman to look upon them indeed it seemed as though all hope and light had gone so far from them that it was not to be brought back for when sir nigel threw down a handful of silver among them there came no softening of their lined faces but they clutched greedily at the coins peering questioningly at him and champing with their animal jaws here and there amid the brushwood the travellers saw the rude bundle of sticks which served them as a home more like a fowl's nest than the of man yet why should they build and strive when the first adventurer who passed would set torch to their thatch and when their own feudal lord would wring from them with blows and curses the last fruits of their toil they sat at the lowest depth of human misery and hugged a bitter comfort to their souls as they realized that they could go no lower yet they had still the human gift of speech and would take council among themselves in their brushwood hovels glaring with bleared eyes and pointing with thin fingers at the great widespread chateaux which ate like a cancer into the life of the when such men who are beyond hope and fear begin in their dim minds to see the source of their woes it may be an evil time for those who have wronged them the weak man becomes strong when he has nothing for then only can he feel the wild mad thrill of despair high and strong the chateaux lowly and weak the brushwood hut but god help the seigneur and his lady when the men of the brushwood set their hands to the work of revenge through such country did the party ride for eight or it might be nine miles until the sun began to slope down in the west and their shadows to stream down the road in front of them wary and careful they must be with watchful eyes to the right and the left for this was no man's land and their only passports were those which hung from their belts frenchmen and englishmen gascon and provencal brabanter tardvenu scorcher flayer and free companion wandered and struggled over the whole of this accursed district so bare and cheerless was the outlook and so few and poor the dwellings that sir nigel began to have fears as to whether he might find food and quarters for his little troop it was a relief to him therefore when their narrow track opened out upon a larger road and they saw some little way down it a square white house with a great bunch of holly hung out at the end of a stick from one of the upper windows cleggett stands by his ship cleggett did not fear or rather expect since there was very little that cleggett feared an attack until well after nightfall nevertheless he began to prepare for it at once he called the entire ship's company aft with the exception of miss medley who was on duty with giuseppe jones my friends for i hope we stand in the relation of friends as well as that of commander and crew i have every reason to expect that the enemy will make a demonstration in force sometime during the night he said we have opposed to us the leader of a dangerous and powerful criminal organization he is in fact the president of a crime trust he will stop at nothing to compass the destruction of the jasper b and all on board her my quarrel with him has become in a sense personal i have no right to ask you to share my risk unless you choose to do so voluntarily therefore if there is anyone of you who wishes to leave the jasper b let him do it now cleggett paused but not a man moved on the contrary a little murmur of something like reproach ran around the semicircle the ship's company looked in each other's eyes they stood shifting their feet uneasily finally cap'n abernethy spoke clearing his throat with a prefatory hem if you was to ask me mr cleggett said the captain with less than his usual circumlocution i'd say the boys here ain't flattered by what you've just said the boys here does consider themselves friends of yours and if you was anxious to hear my opinion of it i'd say you've hurt their feelin's by your way of putting it speakin for myself mr cleggett as the nautical commander of this here ship to the military commander i don't mind owning up that my feelin's is hurt aye aye sir said george the greek addressing the nautical commander and the word went from lip to lip aye aye sir said dr farnsworth the captain speaks for us all and the reverend mr calthrop remarked with a sigh you may have cause to doubt my circumspection mr cleggett but you have no cause to doubt my courage cleggett was not the sort of man who is ashamed to acknowledge an error friends he cried impulsively forgive me i should have known better than to phrase my remarks as i did i would not have hurt your feelings for worlds i know you are devoted to me i call for volunteers for the perilous adventure which is before us the ship's company stepped forward as one man as if by magic the atmosphere cleared now said cleggett smiling back on the enthusiastic faces before him but inexpressibly touched by the fineness of his crew's devotion to get to the point there are seven of us but there are at least a dozen of them we have however the advantage in position for we can find cover on the ship whereas they must attack from the open more than that we will have the advantage in arms here is a magazine rifle for each of you while they if i am not mistaken will attack with pistols we must keep them at a distance if possible if they should attempt to rush us we will meet them with cutlasses and sabers mr cleggett said lady agatha rising when he had finished and speaking with animation will you permit me to make a suggestion she went on without waiting for an answer it is this choose your own ground for this battle the jasper b is now a schooner very well then sail her at the moment you are attacked weigh anchor fight your way to the mouth of the canal take up a position in the bay in front of morris's within easy rifle range and out of pistol shot and compel the place to surrender on your own terms as the brilliance of this plan flashed upon her hearers applause ran around the room and kuroki who spoke seldom cried in admiration the honorable miss englishman have hit her head on the nail let there be some naval warfares you are right cried cleggett catching fire with the idea a hundred times right and why wait to be attacked let us carry the war to the enemy's coast crack all sail upon her up with the anchors we will show these gentry that the blood of drake nelson and old dave farragut still runs red in the veins of their countrymen banzai cried kuroki also honorable admiral togo's veins a good breeze had sprung up out of the northwest while the conference in the cabin was in progress cleggett was relieved that it was not from the south there is not much room to maneuver a schooner in a canal and a breeze from the south might have sailed the jasper b backwards towards parker's beach which would undoubtedly have given the enemy the idea that cleggett was retreating the jasper b s bow was pointed south and cleggett was naturally anxious that she should sail south at the outset a slight difficulty presented itself with regard to the anchors for although as has been explained before the jasper b was a remarkably stable vessel cleggett had had the new anchors furnished by the contractor let down having the anchors down seemed somehow to make things more shipshape it appeared that no one of the adventurers was acquainted with an anchor song and cleggett and indeed all on board felt that these anchors should be hoisted to the accompaniment of some rousing chantey lady agatha was especially insistent on the point chapter iii it was daylight's night he was the centre and the head of the revel unquenchably joyous a contagion of fun he multiplied himself and in so doing multiplied the excitement no prank he suggested was too wild for his followers and all followed save those that developed into singing imbeciles and fell warbling by the wayside yet never did trouble intrude it was known on the yukon that when burning daylight made a night of it wrath and evil were forbidden on his nights men dared not quarrel in the younger days such things had happened and then men had known what real wrath was and been as only burning daylight could on his nights men must laugh and be happy or go home daylight was inexhaustible in between dances he paid over to kearns the twenty thousand in dust and transferred to him his moosehide claim likewise he arranged the taking over of billy rawlins mail contract and made his preparations for the start he despatched a messenger to rout out kama his a tananaw indian from his tribal home in the service of the invading whites kama entered the tivoli tall lean muscular and the pick of his barbaric race and barbaric still unshaken and unabashed by the revellers that rioted about him while daylight gave his orders um said kama tabling his instructions on his fingers get um letters from rawlins load um on sled grub for selkirk you think um plenty stop selkirk plenty kama um bring sled this place nine um clock bring um snowshoes no bring um tent mebbe bring um fly um little fly no fly daylight answered decisively um much cold we travel light savvee we carry plenty letters out plenty letters back you are strong man plenty cold plenty travel all right sure all right kama muttered with resignation much cold no care a damn um ready nine um clock he turned on his moccasined heel and walked out imperturbable neither giving nor receiving greetings nor looking to right or left the virgin led daylight away into a corner look here daylight she said in a low voice you're busted higher'n a kite i've eight thousand in mac's safe she began but daylight interrupted the loomed near and he shied like an unbroken colt it don't matter he said busted i came into the world busted i go out and i've been busted most of the time since i arrived come on let's waltz but listen she urged my money's doing nothing i could lend it to you a she added hurriedly at sight of the alarm in his face nobody me was the answer i stake myself and when i make a killing it's sure all mine no thank you old girl much obliged i'll get my stake by running the mail out and in daylight she murmured in tender protest but with a sudden ebullition of spirits he drew her toward the and as they swung around and around in a waltz she pondered on the iron heart of the man who held her in his arms and resisted all her wiles at six the next morning scorching with whiskey yet ever himself he stood at the bar putting every man's hand down the way of it was that two men faced each other across a corner their right elbows resting on the bar their right hands gripped together while each strove to press the other's hand down man after man came against him but no man put his hand down even olaf henderson and french louis failing despite their hugeness when they contended it was a trick a trained muscular knack he challenged them to another test look here he cried i'm going to do two things first weigh my sack and second bet it that after have lifted clean from the floor all the sacks of flour are able i'll put on two more sacks and lift the whole caboodle clean by gar ah take dat french louis rumbled above the cheers hold on olaf henderson cried i ban yust as good as you louis i yump half that bet put on the scales daylight's sack was found to balance an even four hundred dollars and louis and olaf divided the bet between them sacks of flour were brought in from macdonald's cache other men tested their strength first they straddled on two chairs the flour sacks beneath them on the floor and held together by many of the men were able in this manner to lift four or five hundred pounds while some succeeded with as high as six hundred then the two giants took a hand tying at seven hundred french louis then added another sack and swung seven hundred and fifty clear olaf duplicated the performance whereupon both failed to clear eight hundred again and again they strove their foreheads beaded with sweat their frames crackling with the effort both were able to shift the weight and to bump it but clear the floor with it they could not by gar daylight dis tam you mek one beeg meestake french louis said straightening up and stepping down from the chairs only one damn iron man can do dat one hundred pun more my frien not ten poun more the sacks were unlashed but when two sacks were added kearns interfered only one sack more a story remodeled the pretended halloween was a great success so very excited indeed did david become over the swinging apples and popping nuts that he quite forgot to tell mr jack what the lady of the roses had said until jill had gone up to bed and he himself was about to take from mr jack's hand the little lighted lamp oh mr jack i forgot he cried then there was something i was going to tell you never mind david it's so late suppose we leave it until suggested mr jack still with the lamp extended in his hand but i promised the lady of the roses that i'd say it demurred the boy in a troubled voice the man drew his lamp halfway back suddenly the lady of the roses do you mean she sent a message to me he demanded yes about the story the princess and the pauper you know with an abrupt exclamation mr jack set the lamp on the table and turned to a chair he had apparently lost his haste to go to bed see here david suppose you come and sit down and tell me just what you're talking about and first just what does the lady of the roses know about that that princess and the pauper why she knows it all of course returned the boy in surprise i told it to her you told it to her mr jack relaxed in his chair david yes and she was just as interested as could be i don't doubt it mr jack's lips snapped together a little grimly only she didn't like the ending either mr jack sat up suddenly she didn't like david are you sure did she say that david frowned in thought well i don't know as i can tell exactly but i'm sure she didn't like it because just before she told me what to say to you she said that that what she was going to say would probably have something to do with the ending anyway still david paused in yet deeper thought come to think of it there really isn't anything not in what she said that changed that ending as i can see they didn't get married and live happy ever after anyhow yes but what did she say asked mr jack in a voice that was not quite steady now be careful david and tell it just as she said it oh i will nodded david she said to do that too did she mr jack leaned farther forward in his chair but tell me how did she happen to to say anything about it suppose you begin at the beginning away back david i want to hear it all all david gave a contented sigh and settled himself more comfortably well to begin with you see i told her the story long ago before i was sick and she was ever so interested then and asked lots of questions then the other day something came up i've forgotten how about the ending and i told her how hard i'd tried to have you change it but you wouldn't and she spoke right up quick and said probably you didn't want to change it anyhow but of course i settled that question without any trouble went on david confidently by just telling her how you said you'd give anything in the world to change it and you told her that just that david cried the man why yes i had to answered david in surprise else she wouldn't have known that you did want to change it don't you see oh yes i see a good deal that i'm thinking you don't muttered mr jack falling back in his chair well then is when i told her about the logical ending what you said you know oh yes and that was when i found out she didn't like the ending because she laughed such a funny little laugh and colored up and said that she wasn't sure she could tell me what a logical ending was but that she would try to find out and that anyhow your ending wouldn't be hers she was sure of that david did she say that really mr jack was on his feet now she did and then yesterday she asked me to come over and she said some more things about the story i mean but she didn't say another thing about the ending she didn't ever say anything about that except that little bit i told you of a minute ago yes yes but what did she say demanded mr jack stopping short in his walk up and down the room she said you tell mr jack that i know something about that story of his that perhaps he doesn't in the first place i know the princess a lot better than he does and she isn't a bit the kind of girl he's pictured her yes go on go on now for instance she says when the boy made that call after the girl first came back and when the boy didn't like it because they talked of colleges and travels and such things you tell him that i happen to know that that girl was just hoping and hoping he'd speak of the old days and games but that she couldn't speak of course when he hadn't been even once to see her during all those weeks and when he'd acted in every way just as if he'd forgotten chapter xii the promise of a smooth career which my first calm introduction to thornfield hall seemed to pledge was not belied on a longer acquaintance with the place and its inmates mrs fairfax turned out to be what she appeared a woman of competent education and average intelligence my pupil was a lively child who had been spoilt and indulged and therefore was sometimes wayward but as she was committed entirely to my care and no injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement she soon forgot her little freaks and became obedient and teachable she had no great talents no marked traits of character no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of childhood but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her below it she made reasonable progress entertained for me a vivacious though perhaps not very profound affection and by her simplicity gay prattle and efforts to please inspired me in return with a degree of attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society this par parenthese will be thought cool language by persons who entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children and the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an idolatrous devotion but i am not writing to flatter parental egotism to echo cant or prop up humbug i am merely telling the truth i felt a conscientious solicitude for adele's welfare and progress and a quiet liking for her little self just as i cherished towards mrs fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness and a pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me and the moderation of her mind and character anybody may blame me who likes when i add further that now and then when i took a walk by myself in the grounds when i went down to the gates and looked through them along the road or when while adele played with her nurse and mrs fairfax made jellies in the storeroom i climbed the three staircases raised the of the attic and having reached the leads looked out afar over sequestered field and hill and along dim that then i longed for a power of vision which might overpass that limit which might reach the busy world towns regions full of life i had heard of but never seen that then i desired more of practical experience than i possessed more of intercourse with my kind of acquaintance with variety of character than was here within my reach i valued what was good in mrs fairfax and what was good in adele but i believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness and what i believed in i wished to behold who blames me many no doubt and i shall be called discontented i could not help it the restlessness was in my nature it agitated me to pain sometimes then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey backwards and forwards safe in the silence and solitude of the spot and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it and certainly they were many and glowing to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement which while it swelled it in trouble expanded it with life and best of all to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended a tale my imagination created and narrated continuously quickened with all of incident life fire feeling that i desired and had not in my actual existence it is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity they must have action and they will make it if they cannot find it millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine and millions are in silent revolt against their lot nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth women are supposed to be very calm generally but women feel just as men feel they need exercise for their faculties and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do they suffer from too rigid a restraint too absolute a stagnation precisely as men would suffer and it is in their more privileged to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings to playing on the piano and embroidering bags it is thoughtless to condemn them or laugh at them if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex when thus alone i not unfrequently heard grace poole's laugh the same peal the same low slow ha ha which when first heard had thrilled me i heard too her eccentric murmurs stranger than her laugh there were days when she was quite silent but there were others when i could not account for the sounds she made sometimes i saw her she would come out of her room with a basin or a plate or a tray in her hand go down to the kitchen and shortly return generally oh romantic reader forgive me for telling the plain truth bearing a pot of porter her appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral oddities and staid she had no point to which interest could attach i made some attempts to draw her into conversation but she seemed a person of few words a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort faithful's plain dealing with talkative they say you are a spot among christians and that religion fareth the worse for your ungodly conversation that some have already stumbled at your wicked ways and that more are in danger of being destroyed thereby your religion and an and covetousness and uncleanness and swearing and lying and keeping c will stand together the proverb is true of you which is said of a whore to wit that she is a shame to all women so are you a shame to all professors talk since you are ready to take up reports and to judge so rashly as you do i cannot but conclude you are some peevish or melancholy man not fit to be discoursed with and so adieu chr then came up christian and said to his brother i told you how it would happen your words and his lusts could not agree he had rather leave your company than reform his life but he is gone as i said let him go the loss is no man's but his own he has saved us the trouble of going from him for he continuing as i suppose he will do as he is he would have been but a blot in our company besides the apostle says from such withdraw thyself faith but i am glad we had this little discourse with him it may happen that he will think of it again however i have dealt plainly with him and so am clear of his blood if he perisheth chr you did well to talk so plainly to him as you did there is but little of this faithful dealing with men and that makes religion to stink so in the nostrils of many as it doth for they are these talkative fools whose religion is only in word and are debauched and vain in their conversation that being so much admitted into the fellowship of the godly do puzzle the world blemish christianity and grieve the sincere i wish that all men would deal with such as you have done then should they either be made more conformable to religion or the company of saints would be too hot for them then did faithful say how talkative at first lifts up his plumes how bravely doth he speak how he presumes to drive down all before him but so soon as faithful talks of like the moon that's past the full into the wane he goes and so will all but he that knows thus they went on talking of what they had seen by the way and so made that way easy which would otherwise no doubt have been tedious to them for now they went through a wilderness now when they were got almost quite out of this wilderness faithful chanced to cast his eye back and espied one coming after them and he knew him oh said faithful to his brother who comes yonder then christian looked and said it is my good friend evangelist ay and my good friend too said faithful for it was he that set me in the way to the gate now was evangelist come up to them and thus saluted them evan peace be with you dearly beloved and peace be to your helpers chr welcome welcome my good evangelist the sight of thy countenance brings to my remembrance thy ancient kindness and unwearied labouring for my eternal good faith and a thousand times welcome said good faithful thy company o sweet evangelist how desirable it is to us poor pilgrims evan then said evangelist how hath it fared with you my friends since the time of our last parting what have you met with and how have you behaved yourselves then christian and faithful told him of all things that had happened to them in the way and how and with what difficulty they had arrived at that place evan right glad am i said evangelist not that you have met with trials but that you have been victors and for that you have notwithstanding many weaknesses continued in the way to this very day i say right glad am i of this thing and that for mine own sake and yours i have sowed and you have reaped and the day is coming when both he that sowed and they that reaped shall rejoice together that is if you hold out for in due season ye shall reap if ye faint not john gal the crown is before you and it is an incorruptible one so run that you may obtain it cor some there be that set out for this crown and after they have gone far for it another comes in and takes it from them hold fast therefore that you have let no man take your crown rev you are not yet out of the of the devil you have not resisted unto blood striving against sin let the kingdom be always before you and believe steadfastly concerning things that are invisible let nothing that is on this side the other world get within you and above all look well to your own hearts and to the lusts thereof for they are deceitful above all things and desperately wicked set your faces like a flint you have all power in heaven and earth on your side the leprechaun the shell carried us straight back to the house of yolara larry was awaiting me we stood again before the tenebrous wall where first we had faced the priestess and the voice and as we stood again the portal appeared with all its disconcerting magical abruptness but now the scene was changed around the jet table were grouped a number of figures lugur yolara beside him seven others all of them and all men save one who sat at the left of the priestess an old old woman how old i could not tell her face bearing traces of beauty that must once have been as great as yolara's own but now ravaged in some way awesome through its ruins the fearful malicious gaiety shining out like a spirit of joy held within a corpse began then our examination for such it was and as it progressed i was more and more struck by the change in the o'keefe all flippancy was gone rarely did his sense of humour reveal itself in any of his answers he was like a cautious swordsman fencing guarding studying his opponent or rather like a who keeps sensing some purpose in the game alert contained watchful always he stressed the power of our surface races their multitudes their solidarity their questions were myriad what were our occupations our system of government how great were the waters the land intensely interested were they in the world war querying minutely into its causes its effects in our weapons their interest was avid and they were exceedingly minute in their examination of us as to the ruins which had excited our curiosity their position and surroundings and if others than ourselves might be expected to find and pass through their entrance at this i shot a glance at lugur he did not seem unduly interested i wondered if the russian had told him as yet of the girl of the rosy wall of the moon pool chamber and the real reasons for our search then i answered as briefly as possible omitting all reference to these things the red dwarf watched me with unmistakable amusement and i knew marakinoff had told him but clearly lugur had kept his information even from yolara and as clearly she had spoken to none of that episode when automatic had shattered the vase again i felt that sense of deep bewilderment of helpless search for clue to all the tangle for two hours we were questioned and then the priestess called rador and let us go larry was sombre as we returned he walked about the room uneasily hell's brewing here all right he said at last stopping before me i can't make out just the particular brand that's all that bothers me we're going to have a stiff fight that's sure what i want to do quick is to find the golden girl doc haven't seen her on the wall lately have you he queried hopefully fantastic laugh if you want to he went on but she's our best bet it's going to be a race between her and the o'keefe banshee but i put my money on her i had a queer experience while i was in that garden after you'd left his voice grew solemn did you ever see a leprechaun doc i shook my head again as solemnly he's a little man in green said larry oh about as high as your knee i saw one once in carntogher woods and as i sat there half asleep in yolara's garden the living spit of him stepped out from one of those bushes twirling a little shillalah it's a tight box ye're gettin in larry avick said he but don't ye be downhearted lad i'm carrying on said i but you're a long way from ireland i said or thought i did ye've a lot o friends there he answered an where the heart rests the feet are swift to follow not that i'm sayin i'd like to live here larry said he i know where my heart is now i told him it rests on a girl with golden eyes and the hair and breast of eilidh the fair but me feet don't seem to get me to her i said the brogue thickened an the little man in green nodded his head an whirled his shillalah it's what i came to tell ye says he don't ye fall for the the serpent woman wit the blue eyes she's a daughter of ivor lad an don't ye do nothin to make the coleen ashamed o ye larry o'keefe i knew yer great great grandfather an his before him aroon says he an wan o the o'keefe failin's is to think their hearts big enough to hold all the wimmen o the world a heart's built to hold only wan permanently larry he says an i'm warnin ye a nice girl don't like to move into a place all cluttered up wid another's washin an mendin an cookin an other things pertainin to general wife work not that i think the wan is keen for mendin an cookin says he you don't have to be comin all this way to tell me that i answer well i'm just a tellin you he says ye've got some rough knocks comin larry in fact ye're in for a devil of a time but remember that ye're the o'keefe says he an while the bhoys are all wid ye avick ye've got to be on the job yourself chapter xviii a settler in cloisterham at about this time a stranger appeared in cloisterham a personage with black eyebrows being buttoned up in a tightish blue surtout with a buff waistcoat and gray trousers he had something of a military air but he announced himself at the crozier the orthodox hotel where he put up with a portmanteau as an idle dog who lived upon his means and he farther announced that he had a mind to take a lodging in the picturesque old city for a month or two with a view of settling down there altogether both announcements were made in the of the crozier to all whom it might or might not concern by the stranger as he stood with his back to the empty fireplace waiting for his fried sole veal cutlet and pint of sherry and the waiter business being chronically slack at the crozier represented all whom it might or might not concern and absorbed the whole of the information this white head was unusually large and his shock of white hair was unusually thick and ample i suppose waiter he said shaking his shock of hair as a newfoundland dog might shake his before sitting down to dinner that a fair lodging for a single buffer might be found in these parts eh the waiter had no doubt of it something old said the gentleman take my hat down for a moment from that peg will you no i want it look into it what do you see written there the waiter read datchery now you know my name said the gentleman dick datchery hang it up again i was saying something old is what i should prefer something odd and out of the way something venerable architectural and inconvenient we have a good choice of inconvenient lodgings in the town sir i think replied the waiter with modest confidence in its resources that way indeed i have no doubt that we could suit you that far however particular you might be but a architectural lodging that seemed to trouble the head and he shook it anything cathedraly now mr datchery suggested mr tope said the waiter brightening as he rubbed his chin with his hand would be the likeliest party to inform in that line who is mr tope inquired dick datchery the waiter explained that he was the verger and that mrs tope had indeed once upon a time let lodgings herself or offered to let them but that as nobody had ever taken them mrs long a cloisterham institution had disappeared probably had tumbled down one day and never been put up again call on mrs tope said mr datchery after dinner so when he had done his dinner he was duly directed to the spot and sallied out for it but the crozier being an hotel of a most retiring disposition and the directions being fatally precise he soon became bewildered and went boggling about and about the cathedral tower whenever he could catch a glimpse of it with a general impression on his mind that mrs was somewhere very near it and that like the children in the game of hot boiled beans and very good butter he was warm in his search when he saw the tower and cold when he see it he was getting very cold indeed when he came upon a fragment of in which an unhappy sheep was grazing unhappy because a hideous small boy was stoning it through the railings and had already lamed it in one leg and was much excited by the benevolent sportsmanlike purpose of breaking its other three legs and bringing it down it im agin cried the boy as the poor creature leaped and made a dint in his wool let him be said mr datchery you see you have lamed him yer lie returned the sportsman e went and lamed isself i see im do it and i giv im a shy as a to im not to go is mutton any more come here i come when yer can ketch me stay there then and show me which is mr ow can i stay here and show you which is topeseses when topeseses is side the kinfreederal and over the crossings and round ever so many comers show me where it is and give you something come on then this brisk dialogue concluded the boy led the way and stopped at some distance from an arched passage pointing lookie yonder you see that there winder and door yer lie it indeed said mr datchery with a second look of some interest yes and i no nearer im i tell yer why not cos i to be lifted off my legs and ave my braces bust and be choked not if i knows it and not by im wait till i set a jolly good flint at the back o is jolly old ed some day now look side the harch not the side where door is side i see a little way in o that side a low door down two steps topeseses with is name on a hoval plate viii monseigneur in the country a beautiful landscape with the corn bright in it but not abundant patches of poor rye where corn should have been patches of poor peas and beans patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat on inanimate nature as on the men and women who cultivated it a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly a dejected disposition to give up and wither away monsieur the marquis in his travelling carriage which might have been lighter conducted by four and two postilions fagged up a steep hill a blush on the countenance of monsieur the marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding it was not from within it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control the setting sun the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the that its occupant was steeped in crimson it will die out said monsieur the marquis glancing at his hands directly in effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment when the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage slid down hill with a cinderous smell in a cloud of dust the red glow departed quickly the sun and the marquis going down together there was no glow left when the drag was taken off but there remained a broken country bold and open a little village at the bottom of the hill a broad sweep and rise beyond it a a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on the marquis looked with the air of one who was coming near home the village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poor tannery poor tavern poor for relays of poor fountain all usual poor appointments it had its poor people too all its people were poor and many of them were sitting at their doors shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many were at the fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten expressive signs of what made them poor were not wanting the tax for the state the tax for the church the tax for the lord tax local and tax general were to be paid here and to be paid there according to solemn inscription in the little village until the wonder was that there was any village left unswallowed few children were to be seen and no dogs as to the men and women their choice on earth was stated in the prospect life on the lowest terms that could sustain it down in the little village under the mill or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of his postilions whips which twined about their heads in the evening air as if he came attended by the furies monsieur the marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the gate it was hard by the fountain and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him he looked at them and saw in them without knowing it the slow sure filing down of face and figure that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years monsieur the marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him as the like of himself had drooped before monseigneur of the court only the difference was that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate when a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group bring me hither that fellow said the marquis to the courier the fellow was brought cap in hand and the other fellows closed round to look and listen in the manner of the people at the paris fountain i passed you on the road monseigneur it is true i had the honour of being passed on the road coming up the hill and at the top of the hill both monseigneur it is true what did you look at so fixedly monseigneur i looked at the man he stooped a little and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage all his fellows stooped to look under the carriage what man pig and why look there pardon monseigneur he swung by the chain of the shoe the drag who demanded the traveller monseigneur the man may the devil carry away these idiots how do you call the man you know all the men of this part of the country who was he your clemency monseigneur he was not of this part of the country of all the days of my life i never saw him swinging by the chain to be suffocated with your gracious permission that was the wonder of it monseigneur his head hanging over like this he turned himself sideways to the carriage and leaned back with his face thrown up to the sky and his head hanging down then recovered himself fumbled with his cap and made a bow what was he like monseigneur he was whiter than the miller all covered with dust white as a spectre tall as a spectre chapter the father of the marshalsea thirty years ago there stood a few doors short of the church of saint george in the borough of southwark on the side of the way going southward the marshalsea prison it had stood there many years before and it remained there some years afterwards but it is gone now and the world is none the worse without it it was an oblong pile of barrack building partitioned into squalid houses standing back to back so that there were no back rooms environed by a narrow paved yard hemmed in by high walls duly spiked at top itself a close and confined prison for debtors it contained within it a much closer and more confined jail for smugglers offenders against the revenue laws and defaulters to excise or customs who had incurred fines which they were unable to pay were supposed to be incarcerated behind an door closing up a second prison consisting of a strong cell or two and a blind alley some yard and a half wide which formed the mysterious termination of the very limited in which the marshalsea debtors bowled down their troubles supposed to be incarcerated there because the time had rather outgrown the strong cells and the blind alley in practice they had come to be considered a little too bad though in theory they were quite as good as ever which may be observed to be the case at the present day with other cells that are not at all strong and with other blind alleys that are hence the smugglers habitually consorted with the debtors who received them with open arms except at certain constitutional moments when somebody came from some office to go through some form of overlooking something which neither he nor anybody else knew anything about on these truly british occasions the smugglers if any made a feint of walking into the strong cells and the blind alley while this somebody pretended to do his something and made a reality of walking out again as soon as he done it neatly epitomising the administration of most of the public affairs in our right little tight little island there had been taken to the marshalsea prison long before the day when the sun shone on marseilles and on the opening of this narrative a debtor with whom this narrative has some concern he was at that time a very amiable and very helpless gentleman who was going out again directly necessarily he was going out again directly because the marshalsea lock never turned upon a debtor who was not he brought in a portmanteau with him which he doubted its being worth while to unpack he was so perfectly clear like all the rest of them the turnkey on the lock said that he was going out again directly he was a shy retiring man though in an effeminate style with a mild voice curling hair and irresolute hands rings upon the fingers in those days which nervously wandered to his trembling lip a hundred times in the first of his acquaintance with the jail his principal anxiety was about his wife do you think sir he asked the turnkey that she will be very much shocked if she should come to the gate morning the turnkey gave it as the result of his experience that some of em was and some of em in general more no than yes what like is she you see he philosophically asked what it hinges on she is very delicate and inexperienced indeed that said the turnkey is agen her she is so little used to go out alone said the debtor that i am at a loss to think how she will ever make her way here if she walks quoth the turnkey take a ackney coach perhaps the irresolute fingers went to the trembling lip i hope she will she may not think of it or said the turnkey offering his suggestions from the the top of his wooden stool as he might have offered them to a child for whose weakness he felt a compassion get her brother or her sister to come along with her she has no brother or sister niece nevy cousin serwant young ooman greengrocer dash it one or another on em said the turnkey repudiating beforehand the refusal of all his suggestions i fear i hope it is not against the rules that she will bring the children the children said the turnkey and the rules why lord set you up like a corner pin a playground o children here children why we swarm with em how many a you got two said the debtor lifting his irresolute hand to his lip again and turning into the prison the turnkey followed him with his eyes and you another he observed to himself which makes three on you and your wife another lay a crown which makes four on you and another coming lay make five on you and go another seven and sixpence to name which is the helplessest the unborn baby or you he was right in all his particulars she came next day with a little boy of three years old and a little girl of two and he stood entirely corroborated chapter xlviii surely the golden hours are turning gray and dance no more and vainly strive to run i see their white locks streaming in the wind each face is haggard as it looks at me slow turning in the constant clasping round dorothea's distress when she was leaving the church came chiefly from the perception that mr casaubon was determined not to speak to his cousin and that will's presence at church had served to mark more strongly the alienation between them will's coming seemed to her quite excusable nay she thought it an amiable movement in him towards a reconciliation which she herself had been constantly wishing for he had probably imagined as she had that if mr casaubon and he could meet easily they would shake hands and friendly intercourse might return but now dorothea felt quite robbed of that hope will was banished further than ever for mr casaubon must have been newly embittered by this thrusting upon him of a presence which he refused to recognize he had not been very well that morning suffering from some difficulty in breathing and had not preached in consequence she was not surprised therefore that he was nearly silent at luncheon still less that he made no allusion to will ladislaw for her own part she felt that she could never again introduce that subject they usually spent apart the hours between luncheon and dinner on a sunday mr casaubon in the library dozing chiefly and dorothea in her boudoir where she was wont to occupy herself with some of her favorite books there was a little heap of them on the table in the of various sorts from herodotus which she was learning to read with mr casaubon to her old companion pascal and keble's christian year but she opened one after another and could read none of them everything seemed dreary the portents before the birth of cyrus jewish antiquities oh dear devout epigrams the sacred chime of favorite hymns all alike were as flat as tunes beaten on wood even the spring flowers and the grass had a dull shiver in them under the afternoon clouds that hid the sun fitfully even the sustaining thoughts which had become habits seemed to have in them the weariness of long future days in which she would still live with them for her sole companions it was another or rather a fuller sort of companionship that poor dorothea was hungering for and the hunger had grown from the perpetual effort demanded by her married life she was always trying to be what her husband wished and never able to repose on his delight in what she was the thing that she liked that she spontaneously cared to have seemed to be always excluded from her life for if it was only granted and not shared by her husband it might as well have been denied about will ladislaw there had been a difference between them from the first and it had ended since mr casaubon had so severely repulsed dorothea's strong feeling about his claims on the family property by her being convinced that she was in the right and her husband in the wrong but that she was helpless this afternoon the helplessness was more wretchedly benumbing than ever she longed for objects who could be dear to her and to whom she could be dear she longed for work which would be directly beneficent like the sunshine and the rain and now it appeared that she was to live more and more in a virtual tomb where there was the apparatus of a ghastly labor producing what would never see the light today she had stood at the door of the tomb and seen will ladislaw receding into the distant world of warm activity and fellowship turning his face towards her as he went books were of no use thinking was of no use it was sunday and she could not have the carriage to go to celia who had lately had a baby there was no refuge now from spiritual emptiness and discontent and dorothea had to bear her bad mood as she would have borne a headache after dinner at the hour when she usually began to read aloud mr casaubon proposed that they should go into the library where he said he had ordered a fire and lights he seemed to have revived and to be thinking intently in the library dorothea observed that he had newly arranged a row of his on a table and now he took up and put into her hand a volume which was a table of contents to all the others you will oblige me my dear he said seating himself if instead of other reading this evening you will go through this aloud pencil in hand and at each point where i say mark will make a cross with your pencil this is the first step in a sifting process which i have long had in view and as we go on i shall be able to indicate to you certain principles of selection whereby you will i trust have an intelligent participation in my purpose this proposal was only one more sign added to many since his memorable interview with lydgate that mr casaubon's original reluctance to let dorothea work with him had given place to the contrary disposition namely to demand much interest and labor from her frank r stockton in the very olden time there lived a king whose ideas though somewhat polished and sharpened by the progressiveness of distant latin neighbors were still large florid and untrammeled as became the half of him which was barbaric he was a man of exuberant fancy and withal of an authority so irresistible that at his will he turned his varied fancies into facts he was greatly given to and when he and himself agreed upon anything the thing was done when every member of his domestic and political systems moved smoothly in its appointed course his nature was bland and genial but whenever there was a little hitch and some of his orbs got out of their orbits he was blander and more genial still for nothing pleased him so much as to make the crooked straight and crush down uneven places among the borrowed notions by which his barbarism had become semified was that of the public arena in which by exhibitions of manly and beastly valor the minds of his subjects were refined and cultured but even here the exuberant and barbaric fancy asserted itself the arena of the king was built not to give the people an opportunity of hearing the rhapsodies of dying gladiators nor to enable them to view the inevitable conclusion of a conflict between religious opinions and hungry jaws but for purposes far better adapted to widen and develop the mental energies of the people this vast amphitheater with its encircling galleries its mysterious vaults and its unseen passages was an agent of poetic justice in which crime was punished or virtue rewarded by the decrees of an impartial and incorruptible chance when a subject was accused of a crime of sufficient importance to interest the king public notice was given that on an appointed day the fate of the accused person would be decided in the king's arena a structure which well deserved its name for although its form and plan were borrowed from afar its purpose emanated solely from the brain of this man who every barleycorn a king knew no tradition to which he owed more allegiance than pleased his fancy and who ingrafted on every adopted form of human thought and action the rich growth of his barbaric idealism when all the people had assembled in the galleries and the king surrounded by his court sat high up on his throne of royal state on one side of the arena he gave a signal a door beneath him opened and the accused subject stepped out into the amphitheater directly opposite him on the other side of the inclosed space were two doors exactly alike and side by side it was the duty and the privilege of the person on trial to walk directly to these doors and open one of them he could open either door he pleased he was subject to no guidance or influence but that of the aforementioned impartial and incorruptible chance if he opened the one there came out of it a hungry tiger the fiercest and most cruel that could be procured which immediately sprang upon him and tore him to pieces as a punishment for his guilt the moment that the case of the criminal was thus decided doleful iron bells were clanged great wails went up from the hired mourners posted on the outer rim of the arena and the vast audience with bowed heads and downcast hearts wended slowly their homeward way mourning greatly that one so young and fair or so old and respected should have merited so dire a fate but if the accused person opened the other door there came forth from it a lady the most suitable to his years and station that his majesty could select among his fair subjects and to this lady he was immediately married as a reward of his innocence it mattered not that he might already possess a wife and family or that his affections might be engaged upon an object of his own selection the king allowed no such subordinate arrangements to interfere with his great scheme of retribution and reward the exercises as in the other instance took place immediately and in the arena another door opened beneath the king and a priest followed by a band of choristers and dancing maidens blowing joyous airs on golden horns and treading an epithalamic measure advanced to where the pair stood side by side and the wedding was promptly and cheerily solemnized then the gay brass bells rang forth their merry peals the people shouted glad hurrahs and the innocent man preceded by children strewing flowers on his path led his bride to his home this was the king's method of administering justice its perfect fairness is obvious the criminal could not know out of which door would come the lady he opened either he pleased without having the slightest idea whether in the next instant he was to be devoured or married on some occasions the tiger came out of one door and on some out of the other the decisions of this tribunal were not only fair they were positively determinate the accused person was instantly punished if he found himself guilty and if innocent he was rewarded on the spot whether he liked it or not there was no escape from the judgments of the king's arena chapter vi madame la vicomtesse hesitating on the step a lady stood in the doorway a study in black and white in a frame of pink roses the sash at her waist the lace mantilla that clung about her throat the deftly coiled hair with its sheen of the night waters these in black the simple gown a tribute to the art of her countrywomen in white mrs temple had gone forward to meet her but i stood staring marvelling forgetful in the path they were talking they were coming towards me and i heard mrs temple pronounce my name and hers madame de montméry i bowed she courtesied there was a baffling light in the brown eyes when i dared to glance at them and a smile playing around her mouth was there no word in the two languages to find its way to my lips mrs temple laid her hand on my arm david is not what one might call a ladies man madame she said the lady laughed he she said i am sure you will frighten him with your wit answered mrs temple smiling he is worth sparing he is worth frightening then said the lady in exquisite english and she looked at me again you and david should like each other said mrs temple you are both capable persons friends of the friendless and towers of strength to the weak the face became serious but still there was the expression i could not make out in an instant she seemed to have scrutinized me with a precision from which there could be no appeal i seem to know mr ritchie she said and added quickly mrs clive has talked a great deal about you she has made you out a very wonderful person my dear said mrs temple the wonderful people of this world are those who find time to comfort and help the unfortunate that is why you and david are wonderful no one knows better than i how easy it is to be selfish i have brought you an english novel said madame de montoméry turning abruptly to mrs temple but you must not read it at night lindy is not to let you have it until there said mrs temple gayly to me madame is not happy unless she is controlling some one and i am a rebellious subject you have not been taking care of yourself said madame she glanced at me and bit her lips as though guessing the emotion which my visit had caused listen she said the vesper bells you must go into the house and mr ritchie and i must leave you she took mrs temple by the arm and led her unresisting along the path i followed a thousand thoughts and conjectures spinning in my brain they reached the bench under the little tree beside the door and stood talking for a moment of the routine of mrs life madame it seemed had prescribed a regimen and meant to have it followed suddenly i saw mrs temple take the arm and sink down upon the bench then we were both beside her bending over her she sitting upright and smiling at us it is nothing she said i am so easily tired her lips were ashen and her breath came quickly madame acted with that instant promptness which i expected of her you must carry her in mr ritchie she said quietly no it is only momentary david said mrs temple i remember how pitifully frail and light she was as i picked her up and followed madame through the doorway into the little bedroom i laid mrs temple on the bed send lindy here said madame lindy was in the front room with the negress whom madame had brought with her they were not talking i supposed then this was because lindy did not speak french i did not know that madame de maid was a mute both of them went into the bedroom and i was left alone the door and windows were closed and a green candle was burning on the table i looked about me with astonishment but for the low ceiling and the wide cypress puncheons of the floor the room might have been a budoir in a on the polished mahogany table lay books in tasteful bindings a bookcase stood in the corner a fauteuil and various other chairs which might have come from the hands of an adam were ranged about tall silver candlesticks graced each end of the little and between them were two lowestoft vases having the temple coat of arms it might have been half an hour that i waited now pacing the floor now throwing myself into the by the fireplace anxiety for mrs temple problems that lost themselves in a dozen conjectures all idle these agitated me almost beyond my power of once i felt for the miniature took it out and put it back without looking at it at last i was startled to my feet by the opening of the door and madame de montméry came in she closed the door softly behind her with the deft quickness and decision of movement which a sixth sense had told me she possessed crossed the room swiftly and stood confronting me iii you are coming now miss morris exclaimed carlton from the front of the carriage in which they were moving along the sunny road to athens into a land where one restores his lost illusions anybody who wishes to get back his belief in beautiful things should come here to do it just as he would go to a german sanitarium to build up his nerves or his appetite you have only to drink in the atmosphere and you are cured i know no better antidote than athens for a siege of and muddy asphalt pavements and a course of robert elsmeres and the heavenly twins wait until you see the statues of the young athletes in the museum he cried enthusiastically and get a glimpse of the blue sky back of mount hymettus and the moonlight some evening on the acropolis and you'll be convinced that nothing counts for much in this world but health and straight limbs and tall marble pillars and eyes trained to see only what is beautiful give people a love for beauty and a respect for health miss morris and the result is going to be what they once had here the best art and the greatest writers and satirists and poets the same audience that applauded euripides and sophocles in the open theatre used to cross the road the same day to applaud the athletes who ran naked in the olympian games and gave them as great honor i came here once on a walking tour with a chap who wasn't making as much of himself as he should have done and he went away a changed man and became a personage in the world and you would never guess what it was that did it he saw a statue of one of the greek gods in the museum which showed certain muscles that he couldn't find in his own body and he told me he was going to train down until they did show and he stopped drinking and loafing to do it and took to exercising and working and by the time the muscles showed out clear and strong he was so keen over life that he wanted to make the most of it and as i said he has done it that's what a respect for his own body did for him the carriage stopped at the hotel on one side of the public square of athens with the palace and its gardens blocking one end and yellow houses with red roofs and gay awnings over the cafes surrounding it it was a bright sunny day and the city was clean and cool and pretty breakfast exclaimed miss morris in answer to carlton's inquiry yes i suppose so but i won't feel safe until i have my feet on that rock she was standing on the steps of the hotel looking up with expectant eager eyes at the great acropolis above the city it has been there for a long time now suggested carlton and i think you can risk its being there for a longer well she said reluctantly but i don't wish to lose this chance there might be an earthquake for instance we are likely to see them this morning said carlton as he left the hotel with the ladies and drove towards the acropolis nolan has been interviewing the english maid and she tells him they spend the greater part of their time up there on the rock they are living very simply here as they did in paris that is for the present on wednesday the king gives a dinner and a reception in their honor when does your dinner come off asked miss morris never said carlton grimly one of the reasons why i like to come back to athens so much said mrs downs is because there are so few other tourists here to spoil the local color for you and there are almost as few guides as tourists so that you can wander around undisturbed and discover things for yourself they don't label every fallen column and place fences around the temples they seem to put you on your good behavior then i always like to go to a place where you are as much of a curiosity to the people as they are to you it seems to excuse your staring about you a curiosity exclaimed carlton i should say so the last time i was here i tried to wear a pair of knickerbockers around the city and the people stared so that i had to go back to the hotel and change them i shouldn't have minded it so much in any other country but i thought men who wore jaeger underclothing and women's petticoats for a national costume might have excused so slight an eccentricity as knickerbockers they had no right to throw the first stone the rock upon which the temples of the acropolis are built is more of a hill than a rock it is much steeper upon one side than the other with a sheer fall a hundred yards broad on the opposite side there are the rooms of the hospital of aesculapius and the theatres of dionysus and herodes atticus the top of the rock holds the parthenon and the other smaller temples or what yet remains of them and its surface is littered with broken marble and stones and pieces of rock the top is so closely built over that the few tourists who visit it can imagine themselves its sole occupants for a at a time when carlton and his friends arrived the place appeared quite deserted they left the carriage at the base of the rock and climbed up to the entrance on foot in the andes professor swyington bumper seemed to live in a region all by himself though he was on board the bellaconda he might just as well have been in an airship or riding along on the back of a donkey as far as his knowledge or recognition of his surroundings went he seemed to be thinking thoughts far far away and he was never without a book either a bound volume or a in the former he buried his nose and tom looking over his shoulder once saw that the book was printed in curious characters which later he learned were sanskrit if he had a the professor was continually jotting down memoranda in it i can hardly think of him as a conspirator against us said tom to mr titus after you have been in the contracting business as long as i have you'll distrust every one was the answer waddington isn't on board or i'd distrust him that spaniard senor pinto seems to be out of consideration and there only remains the professor we must watch him but professor bumper proved to be above suspicion carefully guarded inquiries made of the captain the purser and other ships officers brought out the fact that he was well known to all of them having traveled on the line before he is making a search for something but he won't say what it is the captain said at first we thought it was gold or jewels for he goes away off into the andes mountains where both gold and jewels have been found he never looks for treasure though for though some of his party have made rather rich discoveries he takes no interest in them what is he after then asked mr titus no one knows and he won't tell but whatever it is he has never found it yet always when he comes back unsuccessful from a trip to the interior and goes back north with us he will remark that he has not the right directions that he must seek again back he comes next season as full of hope as before but only to be disappointed each time he goes to a new place in the mountains where he digs and delves so members of the parties he hires tell me but with no success he carries with him something in a small iron box and whatever this is he consults it from time to time it may be directions for finding whatever he is after but there seems to be something wrong this is quite a mystery remarked tom it certainly is but professor bumper is a fine man i have known him for years this seems to dispose of the theory that he planted the bomb and that he is one of the plotters in the pay of blakeson grinder said mr titus when he and tom were alone yes i guess it does but who can have done it that was a question neither could answer tom had a theory which he did not disclose to mr titus that after all the somewhat mysterious senor pinto might in some way be mixed up in the bomb attempt but a close questioning of the steward on duty near the foreigner's cabin at the time disclosed the fact that pinto had been ill in his berth all that day well unless the bomb fell from some passing airship i don't see how it got on deck said tom with a shake of his head and i'm sure no airship passed over us they had kept the matter secret not telling even mr damon for they feared the eccentric man would make a fuss and alarm the whole vessel so mr damon occasionally blessing his necktie or his shoe laces played chess with his elderly gentleman friend and was perfectly happy that professor bumper not only had kept his promise about not mentioning the bomb but that he had forgotten all about it was evident a day or two after the happening tom and mr titus passed him on deck and bowed cordially the professor returned the salutation but looked at the two in a puzzled sort of fashion i beg your pardon he remarked but your faces are familiar though i cannot recall your names haven't i seen you before you have said tom with a smile you saved our lives from a bomb the other day oh yes so i did so i did exclaimed professor bumper i felt sure i had seen you before are you all right yes there haven't been any more bombs thrown at us the contractor said by the way professor bumper i understand you are quite a traveler in the andes in the vicinity of lima yes i have been there admitted the scientist in guarded tones well i am digging a tunnel in that vicinity went on mr titus and if you ever get near rimac where the first cutting is made i wish you would come and see me tom too as he is associated with me murmured the professor looking sharply at the contractor digging a tunnel there why are you doing that and he seemed to resent the idea why the peruvian government engaged me to do it to connect the two railroad lines was the answer do you know anything about the place after the cash tom's proposal as a way out of the difficulty and the prompt seconding of it by mr damon seemed to deprive the other bank officials mr swift included of the power of speech for a few moments then as there came to the room where the scene had taken place the sound of the mob outside clamoring for cash mr pendergast the president remarked in a low voice it seems to be the only way do you think you can do it tom swift i'm sure of it as far as my electric car is concerned replied the young inventor if we get the cash i'll have it back here on time the runabout is all ready for a fast trip then don't lose any time tom advised his father every minute counts yes added mr damon come on i've got the securities in my valise and we can bring the cash back in the same satchel come on tom the eccentric character caught up his valise and started from the room tom followed now my son be careful advised his father you know the need of haste but don't take unnecessary risks you'd better go out the back way as the crowd is easily excited little more was said mr swift clasped his son's hand in a firm pressure and the bank president nervously bade the lad then slipping out of the bank by the rear entrance the porter closing the door after them tom and mr damon took their places in the electric machine just imagine you're racing for that prize offered by the touring club of america tom observed mr damon as he deposited the valise at his feet i don't have to do that replied the youth i'm trying for a bigger prize than that i want to save the bank and defeat the schemes of the fogers father and son tom turned on the power and the machine rolled out on the main street as it turned the corner leaving the impatient crowd of depositors now larger than ever behind mr damon glanced over at the new bank and as he did so he called to tom there are the fogers now the young inventor looked and saw andy and his father on the steps of the new institution at the sight of the electric car speeding along andy turned and spoke to his parent what he said seemed to impress mr foger for he started and looked more intently at tom and mr damon then as tom watched he saw the two excitedly conversing and a moment later andy ran off in the direction in which sam snedecker and pete bailey lived i wonder if he's up to any tricks thought tom as he turned on more power well if he is i'll soon be where he can't reach me the young inventor did not dare send his car at full speed through the streets of the town and it was not until several minutes had passed that they could go at more than the ordinary rate but once the open country was reached tom opened her up full and the song the motor sung was one of power the vehicle quickly gathered headway and was soon fairly whizzing along if we keep this up we'll be there and back in good time remarked mr damon yes but we can't do it replied his companion the road to clayton is a poor one and we'll soon be on it then we'll have to go slow but i'll make all the time i can until then so for several miles more they crept along at times having to reduce to almost a walking pace because of bad roads mr damon looked at his watch almost every other minute eleven o'clock he remarked as they passed a milestone and we're not half way there bless my gizzard but i'm afraid we won't make it tom we left about ten and we ought to be back by two o'clock to do any good that's four hours and it will take some time to transfer the securities and get the cash every minute counts i know it answered tom and i'm going to count every minute with eager eyes he watched every inch of the road to steer to the best advantage his hands gripped the wheel until his knuckles showed white with the strain and every now and then his right hand adjusted the speed lever or the controller handle while his foot was on the emergency brake ready to stop the car at the first sign of danger and there was danger not infrequently for the road was up and down hill over frail bridges and along steep cliffs it was no pleasure tour they were on when a little over half the distance had been made they came to a better road and tom was able to use full speed ahead then the electric went so fast that had it not been for the steel in front mr damon at any rate would have been short of breath this is going some he cried to tom the lad nodded grimly and shoved the controller handle over to the last notch then came a bad stretch and they had to slow down again as they were about out of it there came a little flash of fire and the motor stopped conclusion as we have placed before the young ladies so many specimens of young gentlemen and have also in the dedication of this volume given them to understand how much we reverence and admire their numerous virtues and perfections as we have given them such strong reasons to treat us with confidence and to banish in our case all that reserve and distrust of the male sex which as a point of general behaviour they cannot do better than preserve and maintain we say as we have done all this we feel that now when we have arrived at the close of our task they may naturally press upon us the inquiry what particular description of young gentlemen we can conscientiously recommend here we are at a loss we look over our list and can neither recommend the bashful young gentleman nor the young gentleman nor the very friendly young gentleman nor the military young gentleman nor the political young gentleman nor the domestic young gentleman nor the censorious young gentleman nor the funny young gentleman nor the theatrical young gentleman nor the poetical young gentleman nor the young gentleman nor the young ladies young gentleman as there are some good points about many of them which still are not sufficiently numerous to render any one among them eligible as a whole our respectful advice to the young ladies is to seek for a young gentleman who unites in himself the best qualities of all and the worst weaknesses of none and to lead him forthwith to the hymeneal altar whether he will or no and to the young lady who secures him we beg to tender one short fragment of matrimonial advice selected from many sound passages of a similar tendency to be found in a letter written by dean swift to a young lady on her marriage the grand affair of your life will be to gain and preserve the esteem of your husband neither nor virtue will suffer him to esteem you against his judgment and although he is not capable of using you ill yet you will in time grow a thing indifferent and perhaps contemptible unless you can supply the loss of youth and beauty with more durable qualities you have but a very few years to be young and handsome in the eyes of the world and as few months to be so in the eyes of a husband who is not a fool for i hope you do not still dream of charms and raptures which marriage ever did and ever will put a sudden end to from the anxiety we express for the proper behaviour of the fortunate lady after marriage it may possibly be inferred that the young gentleman to whom we have so delicately alluded is no other than ourself without in any way committing ourself upon this point we have merely to observe that we are ready to receive sealed offers containing a full specification of age temper appearance and condition but we beg it to be distinctly understood that we do not pledge ourself to accept the highest bidder these offers may be forwarded to the publishers messrs chapman and hall london to whom all pieces of plate and other testimonials of approbation from the young ladies generally are respectfully requested to be addressed sketches of young couples an urgent remonstrance c to the gentlemen of england being bachelors or widowers the remonstrance of their faithful sheweth that her most gracious majesty victoria by the grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland queen defender of the faith did on the day of november last past declare and pronounce to her most honourable privy council her most gracious intention of entering into the bonds of wedlock that her most gracious majesty in so making known her most gracious intention to her most honourable privy council as aforesaid did use and employ the words it is my intention to ally myself in marriage with prince albert of saxe coburg and gotha that the present is bissextile or leap year in which it is held and considered lawful for any lady to offer and submit proposals of marriage to any gentleman and to enforce and insist upon acceptance of the same under pain of a certain fine or penalty to wit one silk or satin dress of the first quality to be chosen by the lady and paid or owed for by the gentleman that these and other the horrors and dangers with which the said bissextile or leap year threatens the gentlemen of england on every occasion of its periodical return have been greatly aggravated and augmented by the terms of her said most gracious communication which have filled the heads of divers young ladies in this realm with certain new ideas destructive to the peace of mankind that never entered their imagination before that a case has occurred in camberwell in which a young lady informed her papa that she intended to ally herself in marriage with mr smith of stepney and that another and a very distressing case has occurred at tottenham in which a young lady not only stated her intention of allying herself in marriage with her cousin john but taking violent possession of her said cousin actually married him

the man while a level ray of the setting sun flashed across the water and illumined the graven sensitive face now alive with keen interest in the game being played bel dost remember the day inquired the harvester the eager attitude and anxious eyes of the dog betrayed that he did not but was waiting with every sense alert for a familiar word that would tell him what was expected surely you heard the killdeers crying in the night prompted the man i called your attention when the ecstasy of the first bluebird waked the dawn all day you have seen the and osiers the maples and spring tracing announcements of her arrival on the sunny side of the levee the dog found no clew but he recognized tones he loved in the suave easy voice and his tail beat his sides in vigorous approval the man nodded gravely ah so then you realize this day to be the most important of all the coming year to me this hour a solemn one that influences my whole after life it is time for your annual decision on my fate for a are you sure you are fully alive to the gravity of the situation bel the dog felt himself safe in answering a rising inflection ending in his name uttered in that tone and wagged eager assent well then said the man which shall it be do i leave home for the noise and grime of the city open an office and enter the scramble every word was strange to the dog almost breathlessly waiting for a familiar syllable the man gazed steadily into the animal's eyes after a long pause he continued or do i remain at home to harvest the golden seal mullein and ginseng not to mention an occasional hour with the black bass or tramps for partridge and the dog recognized each word of that before the voice ceased his sleek sides were quivering his nostrils twitching his tail lashing and at the pause he leaped up and thrust his nose against the face of the man the harvester leaned back laughing in deep tones then he patted the dog's head with one hand and renewed his grip with the other good old bel he cried exultantly six years you have decided for me and right every time we are of the woods bel born and reared here as our fathers before us what would we of the camp fire the long trail the earthy search we harvesters of herbs the famous chemists require what would we do in a city and when the sap is rising the bass splashing and the wild geese honking in the night we never could endure it bel when we delivered that hemlock at the hospital did you hear that young doctor talking about his lid well up there is ours old fellow just sky and clouds overhead for us forest wind in our faces wild perfume in our nostrils muck on our feet that's the life for us our blood was tainted to begin with and we've lived here so long it is now a passion in our hearts if ever you sentence us to life in the city you'll finish both of us that's what you'll do but you won't will you you realize what god made us for and what he made for us don't you bel fagin's last night alive the court was paved from floor to roof with human faces inquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space from the rail before the dock away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries all looks were fixed upon one man fagin before him and behind above below on the right and on the left he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament all bright with gleaming eyes he stood there in all this glare of living light with one hand resting on the wooden slab before him the other held to his ear and his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge who was delivering his charge to the jury at times he turned his eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his favour and when the points against him were stated with terrible distinctness looked towards his counsel in mute appeal that he would even then urge something in his behalf beyond these manifestations of anxiety he stirred not hand or foot he had scarcely moved since the trial began and now that the judge ceased to speak he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention with his gaze bent on him as though he listened still a slight bustle in the court recalled him to himself looking round he saw that the juryman had turned together to consider their verdict as his eyes wandered to the gallery he could see the people rising above each other to see his face some hastily applying their glasses to their eyes and others whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence a few there were who seemed unmindful of him and looked only to the jury in impatient wonder how they could delay but in no one face not even among the women of whom there were many there could he read the faintest sympathy with himself or any feeling but one of interest that he should be condemned as he saw all this in one bewildered glance the deathlike stillness came again and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge hush they only sought permission to retire he looked wistfully into their faces one by one when they passed out as though to see which way the greater number leant but that was fruitless the jailer touched him on the shoulder he followed mechanically to the end of the dock and sat down on a chair the man pointed it out or he would not have seen it he looked up into the gallery again some of the people were eating and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs for the crowded place was very hot there was one young man sketching his face in a little he wondered whether it was like and looked on when the artist broke his and made another with his knife as any idle spectator might have done in the same way when he turned his eyes towards the judge his mind began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress and what it cost and how he put it on there was an old fat gentleman on the bench too who had gone out some half an hour before and now come back he wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner what he had had and where he had had it and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused another not that all this time his mind was for an instant free from one oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet it was ever present to him but in a vague and general way and he could not fix his thoughts upon it thus even while he trembled and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death he fell to counting the iron spikes before him and wondering how the head of one had been broken off and whether they would mend it or leave it as it was then he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it and then went on to think again at length there was a cry of silence and a breathless look from all towards the door the jury returned and passed him close he could glean nothing from their faces they might as well have been of stone perfect stillness ensued not a rustle not a breath guilty the building rang with a tremendous shout and another and another and then it echoed loud groans that gathered strength as they swelled out like angry thunder it was a peal of joy from the populace outside greeting the news that he would die on monday the noise subsided and he was asked if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him he had resumed his listening attitude and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it and then he only muttered that he was an old man an old man and so dropping into a whisper was silent again the mahar temple the aborigine apparently uninjured climbed quickly into the skiff and seizing the spear with me helped to hold off the infuriated creature blood from the wounded reptile was now crimsoning the waters about us and soon from the weakening struggles it became evident that i had inflicted a death wound upon it presently its efforts to reach us ceased entirely and with a few convulsive movements it turned upon its back quite dead and then there came to me a sudden realization of the predicament in which i had placed myself i was entirely within the power of the savage man whose skiff i had stolen still clinging to the spear i looked into his face to find him scrutinizing me intently and there we stood for some several minutes each clinging tenaciously to the weapon the while we gazed in stupid wonderment at each other what was in his mind i do not know but in my own was merely the question as to how soon the fellow would recommence hostilities presently he spoke to me but in a tongue which i was unable to translate i shook my head in an effort to indicate my ignorance of his language at the same time addressing him in the bastard tongue that the sagoths use to converse with the human slaves of the mahars to my delight he understood and answered me in the same jargon what do you want of my spear he asked only to keep you from running it through me i replied i would not do that he said for you have just saved my life and with that he released his hold upon it and squatted down in the bottom of the skiff who are you he continued and from what country do you come i too sat down laying the spear between us and tried to explain how i came to pellucidar and wherefrom but it was as impossible for him to grasp or believe the strange tale i told him as i fear it is for you upon the outer crust to believe in the existence of the inner world to him it seemed quite ridiculous to imagine that there was another world far beneath his feet peopled by beings similar to himself and he laughed uproariously the more he thought upon it but it was ever thus that which has never come within the scope of our really pitifully meager cannot be our finite minds cannot grasp that which may not exist in accordance with the conditions which obtain about us upon the outside of the insignificant grain of dust which wends its tiny way among the bowlders of the universe the speck of moist dirt we so proudly call the world so i gave it up and asked him about himself he said he was a mezop and that his name was ja who are the mezops i asked where do they live he looked at me in surprise i might indeed believe that you were from another world he said for who of pellucidar could be so ignorant the mezops live upon the islands of the seas in so far as i ever have heard no mezop lives elsewhere and no others than mezops dwell upon islands but of course it may be different in other lands i do not know at any rate in this sea and those near by it is true that only people of my race inhabit the islands we are fishermen though we be great hunters as well often going to the mainland in search of the game that is scarce upon all but the larger islands and we are warriors also he added proudly even the sagoths of the mahars fear us once when pellucidar was young the sagoths were wont to capture us for slaves as they do the other men of pellucidar it is handed down from father to son among us that this is so but we fought so desperately and slew so many sagoths and those of us that were captured killed so many mahars in their own cities that at last they learned that it were better to leave us alone and later came the time that the mahars became too indolent even to catch their own fish except for amusement and then they needed us to supply their wants and so a truce was made between the races now they give us certain things which we are unable to produce in return for the fish that we catch and the mezops and the mahars live in peace the great ones even come to our islands it is there far from the prying eyes of their own sagoths that they practice their religious rites in the temples they have builded there with our assistance if you live among us you will doubtless see the manner of their worship which is strange indeed and most unpleasant for the poor slaves they bring to take part in it as ja talked i had an excellent opportunity to inspect him more closely he was a huge fellow standing i should say six feet six or seven inches well developed and of a coppery red not unlike that of our own north american indian nor were his features dissimilar to theirs he had the aquiline nose found among many of the higher tribes the prominent cheek bones and black hair and eyes but his mouth and lips were better molded all in all ja was an impressive and handsome creature and he talked well too even in the miserable makeshift language we were compelled to use how mr ralph nickleby provided for his niece and on the second morning after the departure of nicholas for yorkshire kate nickleby sat in a very faded chair raised upon a very dusty throne in miss la room giving that lady a sitting for the portrait upon which she was engaged and towards the full perfection of which miss la creevy had had the case brought upstairs in order that she might be the better able to infuse into the counterfeit countenance of miss nickleby a bright salmon which she had originally hit upon while executing the miniature of a young officer therein contained and which bright salmon was considered by miss la chief friends and patrons to be quite a novelty in art as indeed it was i think i have caught it now said miss la creevy the very shade this will be the sweetest portrait i have ever done certainly it will be your genius that makes it so then i am sure replied kate smiling no no i allow that my dear rejoined miss la creevy a very nice subject a very nice subject indeed though of course something depends upon the mode of treatment and not a little observed kate why my dear you are right there said miss la creevy in the main you are right there though i allow that it is of such very great importance in the present case ah the difficulties of art my dear are great they must be i have no doubt said kate humouring her little friend they are beyond anything you can form the faintest conception of replied miss la creevy what with bringing out eyes with all power and keeping down noses with all force and adding to heads and taking away teeth altogether you have no idea of the trouble one little miniature is the remuneration can scarcely repay you said kate why it does not and the truth answered miss la creevy and then people are so dissatisfied and unreasonable that nine times out of ten no pleasure in painting them sometimes they say oh how very serious you have made me look miss la creevy and at others la miss la creevy how very smirking when the very essence of a good portrait is that it must be either serious or smirking or no portrait at all indeed said kate laughing certainly my dear because the sitters are always either the one or the other replied miss la creevy look at the royal academy all those beautiful shiny portraits of gentlemen in black velvet waistcoats with their fists doubled up on round tables or marble slabs are serious you know and all the ladies who are playing with little parasols or little dogs or little children the same rule in art only varying the objects are smirking in fact said miss la creevy sinking her voice to a confidential whisper there are only two styles of portrait painting the serious and the smirk and we always use the serious for professional people except actors sometimes and the smirk for private ladies and gentlemen who care so much about looking clever kate seemed highly amused by this information and miss la creevy went on painting and talking with immovable complacency what a number of officers you seem to paint said kate availing herself of a pause in the discourse and glancing round the room number of what child inquired miss la creevy looking up from her work character portraits oh yes not real military men you know no bless your heart of course not only clerks and that who hire a uniform coat to be painted in and send it here in a carpet bag some artists said miss la creevy keep a red coat and charge extra for hire and carmine but i do that myself for i consider it legitimate drawing herself up as though she plumed herself greatly upon not resorting to these lures to catch sitters miss la creevy applied herself more intently to her task only raising her head occasionally to look with unspeakable satisfaction at some touch she had just put in and now and then giving miss nickleby to understand what particular feature she was at work upon at the moment not she expressly observed that you should make it up for painting my dear but because our custom sometimes to tell sitters what part we are upon in order that if any particular expression they want introduced they may throw it in at the time you know and when said miss la creevy after a long silence to wit an interval of full a minute and a half when do you expect to see your uncle again i scarcely know i had expected to have seen him before now replied kate soon i hope for this state of uncertainty is worse than anything i suppose he has money he inquired miss la creevy he is very rich i have heard rejoined kate i know that he is but i believe so ah you may depend upon it he is or he be so surly remarked miss la creevy who was an odd little mixture of shrewdness and simplicity when a a bear he is generally pretty independent part ii she never even asked who it was amelia reported to her sisters when she had returned to the house because she knew replied sophia sagely there has never been any old friend but that one old friend to come back into eudora life has he come back into her life i wonder said amelia what did he return to wellwood for if he come for that all his relatives are gone he never married yes he has come back to see eudora and marry her if she will have him no man who ever loved eudora would ever get over loving her and he will not be shocked when he sees her she is no more changed than a beautiful old statue he is changed though said amelia i saw him the other day he see me and i would hardly have known him he has grown stout and his hair is gray hair is gray said sophia yes but you can see the gold through gray it just looks as if a shadow was thrown over it it change her harry gray hair does change him if said anna sentimentally eudora thinks hair turned gray for love of her you can trust her or any woman to see the gold through it hair was never gold just an ordinary brown said amelia anyway the lawtons turned gray young she think of that at all said sophia i wonder why eudora always avoided him so years ago said amelia why a girl in a field of daisies stop to pick one which she never forgets said sophia eudora had so many chances and i think her heart was fixed when she was very young at least i think it was fixed so she knew it i wonder said amelia if he will go and call on her amelia privately wished that she lived near enough to know if harry lawton did call she as well as mrs joseph glynn would have enjoyed watching out and knowing something of the village happenings but the lancaster house was situated so far from the road behind its grove of trees that nothing whatever could be seen i doubt if eudora tells if he does call that is not unless something definite happens said anna no remarked amelia sadly eudora is a dear but she is very silent with regard to her own affairs she ought to be said sophia with her married authority she was to her sisters as one who had passed within the shrine and was dignifiedly silent with regard to its intimate mysteries i suppose so assented anna with a soft sigh amelia sighed also then she took the out of the room she had to make some biscuits for supper meantime eudora was pacing homeward with the her serene face was a little perturbed her oval cheeks were flushed and her mouth now and then trembled she had if she followed her usual course to pass the wellwood inn but she could diverge and by taking a side street and walking a farther reach home without coming in sight of the inn she did so when she reached the side street she turned rather swiftly and gave a little sigh of relief she was afraid that she might meet harry lawton it was a lonely way there was a brook on one side bordered thickly with bushy willows which were turning on the other side were undulating on which grazed a few sheep there were no houses until she reached the turn which would lead back to the main street on which her home was located eudora was about midway of this street when she saw a man approaching he was a large man clad in gray and he was swinging an umbrella somehow the swing of that umbrella even from a distance gave an impression of embarrassment and boyish hesitation eudora did not know him at first she had expected to see the same harry lawton who had gone away she did not expect to see a stout man but a slim youth however as they drew nearer each other she knew and curiously enough it was that swing of the tightly furled umbrella which gave her the clue she knew harry because of that it was a little boyish trick which had survived time it was too late for her to draw back for he had seen her and eudora was keenly alive to the indignity of abruptly turning and scuttling away with the tail of her black silk swishing her india shawl trailing and the bumping over the furrows she continued and harry lawton continued and they met harry lawton had known eudora at once she looked the same to him as when she had been a girl and he looked the same to her when he spoke hullo eudora said harry lawton in a ludicrously boyish fashion his face flushed too like a boy he extended his hand like a boy the man seen near at hand was a boy in reality he himself had not changed a few layers of flesh and a change of do not make another man he had always been a simple sincere friendly soul beloved of men and women alike and he was that now eudora held out her hand and her eyes fell before the eyes of the man in an absurd fashion for such a stately creature as she but the man himself acted like a great happy overgrown chapter v stern lawgiver yet thou dost wear the most benignant grace nor know we anything so fair as is the smile upon thy face flowers laugh before thee on their beds and fragrance in thy footing treads thou dost preserve the stars from wrong and the most ancient heavens through thee are fresh and strong wordsworth ode to duty picture dog and cat but what became of little tom he slipped away off the rocks into the water as i said before but he could not help thinking of little ellie he did not remember who she was but he knew that she was a little girl though she was a hundred times as big as he that is not surprising size has nothing to do with kindred a tiny weed may be first cousin to a great tree and a little dog like vick knows that lioness is a dog too though she is twenty times larger than herself so tom knew that ellie was a little girl and thought about her all that day and longed to have had her to play with but he had very soon to think of something else and here is the account of what happened to him as it was published next morning in the gazette on the finest watered paper for the use of the great fairy mrs bedonebyasyoudid who reads the news very carefully every morning and especially the police cases as you will hear very soon he was going along the rocks in water watching the pollock catch prawns and the wrasses nibble barnacles off the rocks shells and all when he saw a round cage of green withes and inside it looking very much ashamed of himself sat his friend the lobster twiddling his horns instead of thumbs picture tom the lobster and otter what have you been naughty and have they put you in the asked tom the lobster felt a little indignant at such a notion but he was too much depressed in spirits to argue so he only said i get out why did you get in after that nasty piece of dead fish he had thought it looked and smelt very nice when he was outside and so it did for a lobster but now he turned round and abused it because he was angry with himself where did you get in through that round hole at the top then why you get out through it because i and the lobster twiddled his horns more fiercely than ever but he was forced to confess i have jumped upwards downwards backwards and sideways at least four thousand times and i get out i always get up underneath there and find the hole tom looked at the trap and having more wit than the lobster he saw plainly enough what was the matter as you may if you will look at a stop a bit said tom turn your tail up to me and pull you through hindforemost and then you stick in the spikes but the lobster was so stupid and clumsy that he hit the hole like a great many he was very sharp as long as he was in his own country but as soon as they get out of it they lose their heads and so the lobster so to speak lost his tail tom reached and clawed down the hole after him till he caught hold of him and then as was to be expected the clumsy lobster pulled him in head foremost hullo here is a pretty business said tom now take your great claws and break the points off those spikes and then we shall both get out easily dear me i never thought of that said the lobster and after all the experience of life that i have had you see experience is of very little good unless a man or a lobster has wit enough to make use of it for a good many people like old polonius have seen all the world and yet remain little better than children after all but they had not got half the spikes away when they saw a great dark cloud over them and lo and behold it was the otter how she did grin and grin when she saw tom yar said she you little meddlesome wretch i have you now i will serve you out for telling the salmon where i was and she crawled all over the pot to get in tom was horribly frightened and still more frightened when she found the hole in the top and squeezed herself right down through it all eyes and teeth but no sooner was her head inside than valiant mr lobster caught her by the nose and held on and there they were all three in the pot rolling over and over and very tight packing it was and the lobster tore at the otter and the otter tore at the lobster and both squeezed and thumped poor tom till he had no breath left in his body and i know what would have happened to him if he had not at last got on the back and safe out of the hole moll flanders my true name is so well known in the records or registers at newgate and in the old bailey and there are some things of such consequence still depending there relating to my particular conduct that it is not be expected i should set my name or the account of my family to this work perhaps after my death it may be better known at present it would not be proper nor not though a general pardon should be issued even without exceptions and reserve of persons or crimes it is enough to tell you that as some of my worst comrades who are out of the way of doing me harm having gone out of the world by the steps and the string as i often expected to go knew me by the name of moll flanders so you may give me leave to speak of myself under that name till i dare own who i have been as well as who i am i have been told that in one of neighbour nations whether it be in france or where else i know not they have an order from the king that when any criminal is condemned either to die or to the galleys or to be transported if they leave any children as such are generally unprovided for by the poverty or forfeiture of their parents so they are immediately taken into the care of the government and put into a hospital called the house of orphans where they are bred up clothed fed taught and when fit to go out are placed out to trades or to services so as to be well able to provide for themselves by an honest industrious behaviour had this been the custom in our country i had not been left a poor desolate girl without friends without clothes without help or helper in the world as was my fate and by which i was not only exposed to very great distresses even before i was capable either of understanding my case or how to amend it but brought into a course of life which was not only scandalous in itself but which in its ordinary course tended to the swift destruction both of soul and body but the case was otherwise here my mother was convicted of felony for a certain petty theft scarce worth naming viz having an opportunity of borrowing three pieces of fine holland of a certain draper in cheapside the circumstances are too long to repeat and i have heard them related so many ways that i can scarce be certain which is the right account however it was this they all agree in that my mother pleaded her belly and being found quick with child she was respited for about seven months in which time having brought me into the world and being about again she was called down as they term it to her former judgment but obtained the favour of being transported to the plantations and left me about half a year old and in bad hands you may be sure this is too near the first hours of my life for me to relate anything of myself but by hearsay it is enough to mention that as i was born in such an unhappy place i had no parish to have recourse to for my nourishment in my infancy nor can i give the least account how i was kept alive other than that as i have been told some relation of my took me away for a while as a nurse but at whose expense or by whose direction i know nothing at all of it the first account that i can recollect or could ever learn of myself was that i had wandered among a crew of those people they call gypsies or egyptians but i believe it was but a very little while that i had been among them for i had not had my skin discoloured or blackened as they do very young to all the children they carry about with them nor can i tell how i came among them or how i got from them it was at colchester in essex that those people left me and i have a notion in my head that i left them there that is that i hid myself and would not go any farther with them but i am not able to be particular in that account only this i remember that being taken up by some of the parish officers of colchester i gave an account that i came into the town with the gypsies but that i would not go any farther with them and that so they had left me but whither they were gone that i knew not nor could they expect it of me for though they send round the country to inquire after them it seems they could not be found i was now in a way to be provided for for though i was not a parish charge upon this or that part of the town by law yet as my case came to be known and that i was too young to do any work being not above three years old compassion moved the magistrates of the town to order some care to be taken of me and i became one of their own as much as if i had been born in the place i climb the crags a second time i remember that i looked over the brink into the yeasty abyss with a mind hovering between perplexity and tears i wanted to sit down and cry why i did not know except that some great thing had happened my brain was quite clear as to my own position i was shut in this place with no chance of escape and with no food in a little i must die of starvation or go mad and throw myself after laputa and yet i did not care a rush my nerves had been tried too greatly in the past week now i was comatose and beyond hoping or fearing i sat for a long time watching the light play on the fretted sheet of water and wondering where laputa's body had gone i shivered and wished he had not left me alone for the darkness would come in time and i had no matches after a little i got tired of doing nothing and went groping among the treasure chests one or two were full of coin british sovereigns kruger sovereigns napoleons spanish and portuguese gold pieces and many older coins ranging back to the middle ages and even to the ancients in one handful there was a splendid gold stater and in another a piece of antoninus pius the treasure had been collected for many years in many places contributions of chiefs from ancient hoards as well as the cash received from i untied one or two of the little bags of stones and poured the contents into my hands most of the diamonds were small such as a labourer might secrete on his person the larger ones and some were very large were as a rule discoloured looking more like big cairngorms but one or two bags had big stones which even my inexperienced eye told me were of the purest water there must be some new pipe i thought for these could not have been stolen from any known mine after that i sat on the floor again and looked at the water it exercised a mesmeric influence on me soothing all care i was quite happy to wait for death for death had no meaning to me my hate and fury were both lulled into a trance since the passive is the next stage to the overwrought it must have been full day outside now for the funnel was bright with sunshine and even the dim cave caught a reflected radiance as i watched the river i saw a bird flash downward skimming the water it turned into the cave and fluttered among its dark recesses i heard its wings beating the roof as it sought wildly for an outlet it dashed into the spray of the cataract and escaped again into the cave for maybe twenty minutes it fluttered till at last it found the way it had entered by with a dart it sped up the funnel of rock into light and freedom i had begun to watch the bird in idle lassitude i ended in keen excitement the sight of it seemed to take a film from my eyes i realized the zest of liberty the passion of life again i felt that beyond this dim underworld there was the great joyous earth and i longed for it i wanted to live now my memory cleared and i remembered all that had befallen me during the last few days i had played the chief part in the whole business and i had won laputa was dead and the treasure was mine while arcoll was crushing the rising at his ease i had only to be free again to be famous and rich my hopes had returned but with them came my fears what if i could not escape i must perish miserably by degrees shut in the heart of a hill though my friends were out for rescue in place of my former lethargy i was now in a fever of unrest my first care was to explore the way i had come i ran down the passage to the chasm which the slab of stone had spanned i had been right in my guess for the thing was gone laputa was in truth a titan who in the article of death could break down a bridge which would have taken any three men an hour to shift the gorge was about seven yards wide too far to risk a jump and the cliff fell sheer and smooth to the imprisoned waters two hundred feet below there was no chance of circuiting it for the wall was as smooth as if it had been chiselled the hand of man had been at work to make the sanctuary inviolable it occurred to me that sooner or later arcoll would track laputa to this place he would find the bloodstains in the gully but the turnstile would be shut and he would never find the trick of it nor could he have any kaffirs with him who knew the secret of the place of the snake still if arcoll knew i was inside he would find some way to get to me even though he had to dynamite the curtain of rock i shouted but my voice seemed to be drowned in the roar of the water it made but a fresh chord in the wild orchestra and i gave up hopes in that direction edna ferber introduction ix the woman who tried to be good the gay old dog that's marriage farmer in the dell un morso doo pang long distance the maternal feminine remainder not included the woman who tried to be good before she tried to be a good woman she had been a very bad woman so bad that she could trail her wonderful apparel up and down main street from the elm tree bakery to the railroad tracks without once having a man doff his hat to her or a woman bow you passed her on the street with a surreptitious glance though she was well worth looking at in her furs and laces and plumes she had the only mink coat in our town and ganz's shoe store sent to chicago for her shoes hers were the miraculously small feet you frequently see in stout women usually she walked alone but on rare occasions especially round christmastime she might have been seen accompanied by some silent girl who would follow her dumbly in and out of stores stopping now and then to admire a cheap comb or a chain set with flashy imitation stones or queerly enough a doll with yellow hair and blue eyes and very pink cheeks but alone or in company her appearance in the stores of our town was the signal for a sudden jump in the cost of living the storekeepers mulcted her and she knew it and paid in silence for she was of the class that has no redress she owned the house with the closed shutters near the freight depot did blanche devine in a larger town than ours she would have passed unnoticed she did not look like a bad woman of course she used too much and as she passed you caught the oversweet breath of a certain heavy scent then too her diamond eardrops would have made any woman's features look hard but her plump face in spite of its heaviness wore an expression of intelligence and her eyeglasses gave her somehow a look of respectability we do not associate vice with eyeglasses so in a large city she would have passed for a prosperous comfortable wife and mother who was in danger of losing her figure from an overabundance of good living but with us she was a town character like old man givins the drunkard or the binns girl when she passed the corner there would be a sniggering among the loafers idling there and they would leer at each other and jest in undertones so knowing blanche devine as we did there was something resembling a riot in one of our most respectable neighborhoods when it was learned that she had given up her interest in the house near the freight depot and was going to settle down in the white cottage on the corner and be good all the husbands in the block urged on by righteously indignant wives dropped in on alderman mooney after supper to see if the thing could not be stopped the fourth of the protesting husbands to arrive was the very young husband who lived next door to the corner cottage that blanche devine had bought the very young husband had a very young wife and they were the joint owners of snooky snooky was and looked something like an angel only healthier and with grimier hands the whole neighborhood borrowed her and tried to spoil her but snooky would not spoil alderman mooney was down in the cellar fooling with the furnace he was in his furnace overalls a short black pipe in his mouth three protesting husbands had just left as the very young husband following mrs mooney's directions descended the cellar stairs alderman mooney looked up from his tinkering he peered through a haze of pipe smoke hello he called and waved the haze away with his open palm come on down been tinkering with this blamed furnace since supper she don't draw like she ought long toward spring a furnace always gets balky how many tons you used this winter said the very young husband shortly alderman mooney considered it thoughtfully the young husband leaned up against the side of the water tank his hands in his pockets say mooney is that right about blanche devine's having bought the house on the corner you're the fourth man that's been in to ask me that this evening i'm expecting the rest of the block before bedtime she bought it all right the young husband flushed and kicked at a piece of coal with the toe of his boot well it's a darned shame he began hotly jen was ready to cry at supper this'll be a fine neighborhood for snooky to grow up in what's a woman like that want to come into a respectable street for anyway i own my home and pay my taxes alderman mooney looked up so does she he interrupted she's going to improve the place paint it and put in a cellar and a furnace and build a porch and lay a cement walk all round the young husband took his hands out of his pockets in order to emphasize his remarks with gestures chapter i a novel case talking of sudden disappearances the one you mention of hannah in that leavenworth case of ours is not the only remarkable one which has come under my direct notice indeed i know of another that in some respects at least surpasses that in points of interest and if you will promise not to inquire into the real names of the parties concerned as the affair is a secret i will relate you my experience regarding it the speaker was q the rising young detective universally acknowledged by us of the force as the most astute man for mysterious and unprecedented cases then in the bureau always and of course excepting mr gryce and such a statement from him could not but arouse our deepest curiosity drawing up then to the stove around which we were sitting in lazy enjoyment of one of those so dear to a heart we gave with alacrity the required promise and settling himself back with the satisfied air of a man who has a good story to tell that does not entirely lack certain points redounding to his own credit he began i was one sunday morning loitering at the precinct station when the door opened and a woman came in whose agitated air at once attracted my attention going up to her i asked her what she wanted a detective she replied glancing cautiously about on the faces of the various men scattered through the room i wish anything said about it but a girl disappeared from our house last night and she stopped here her emotion seeming to choke her and i want some one to look her up she went on at last with the most intense emphasis a girl what kind of a girl and what house do you mean when you say our house she looked at me keenly before replying you are a young man said she there some one here more responsible than yourself that i can talk to i shrugged my shoulders and beckoned to mr gryce who was just then passing she at once seemed to put confidence in him drawing him aside she whispered a few low eager words which i could not hear he listened nonchalantly for a moment but suddenly made a move which i knew indicated strong and surprised interest though from his face but you know what face is i was about to walk off convinced he had got hold of something he would prefer to manage himself when the superintendent came in where is gryce asked he tell him i want him mr gryce heard him and hastened forward as he passed me he whispered take a man and go with this woman look into matters and send me word if you want me i will be here for two hours i did not need a second permission beckoning to harris i reapproached the woman where do you come from said i i am to go back with you and investigate the affair it seems did he say so she asked pointing to mr gryce who now stood with his back to us busily talking with the superintendent i nodded and she at once moved towards the door i come from no second avenue mr house she whispered uttering a name so well known i at once understood mr movement of sudden interest a girl one who sewed for us disappeared last night in a way to alarm us very much she was taken from her room yes she cried vehemently seeing my look of sarcastic incredulity taken from her room she never went of her own accord and she must be found if i spend every dollar of the pittance i have laid up in the bank against my old age her manner was so intense her tone so marked and her words so vehement i at once and naturally asked if the girl was a relative of hers that she felt her abduction so keenly no she replied not a relative but she went on looking every way but in my face a very dear friend a a protegee i think they call it of mine i i she must be found she again reiterated we were by this time in the street nothing must be said about it she now whispered catching me by the arm i told him so nodding back to the building from which we had just issued and he promised secrecy it can be done without folks knowing anything about it it what i asked finding the girl well said i we can tell you better about that when we know a few more of the facts what is the name and what makes you think she go out of the of her own accord why why everything she the person to do it then the looks of her room and they all got out of the window she cried suddenly and went away by the side gate into street they who do you mean by they why whoever they were who carried her off i could not suppress the bah that rose to my lips mr gryce might have been able to but i am not gryce chapter two for the next almayer who wanted to give joanna plenty of time stumbled amongst the lumber in distant parts of his enclosure sneaked along the fences or held his breath flattened against grass walls behind various outhouses all this to escape inconveniently zealous search for his master he heard him talk with the head watchman sometimes quite close to him in the darkness then moving off coming back wondering and as the time passed growing uneasy he did not fall into the river say thou blind watcher ali was growling in a bullying tone to the other man he told me to fetch mahmat and when i came back swiftly i found him not in the house there is that sirani woman there so that mahmat cannot steal anything but it is in my mind the night will be half gone before i rest he shouted master o master o mast what are you making that noise for said almayer with severity stepping out close to them the two malays leaped away from each other in their surprise you may go i want you any more tonight ali went on almayer is mahmat there unless the savage got tired of waiting those men know not politeness they should not be spoken to by white men said ali resentfully almayer went towards the house leaving his servants to wonder where he had sprung from so unexpectedly the watchman hinted obscurely at powers of invisibility possessed by the master who often at night ali interrupted him with great scorn not every white man has the power now the rajah laut could make himself invisible also he could be in two places at once as everybody knew except he the useless watchman who knew no more about white men than a wild pig and ali strolled towards his hut yawning loudly as almayer ascended the steps he heard the noise of a door flung to and when he entered the verandah he saw only mahmat there close to the doorway of the passage mahmat seemed to be caught in the very act of slinking away and almayer noticed that with satisfaction seeing the white man the malay gave up his attempt and leaned against the wall he was a short thick man with very dark skin and a wide stained mouth that uncovered when he spoke a close row of black and glistening teeth his eyes were big prominent dreamy and restless he said sulkily looking all over the place from under his eyebrows white tuan you are great and strong and i a poor man tell me what is your will and let me go in the name of god it is late almayer examined the man thoughtfully how could he find out whether he had it lately he had employed that man and his two brothers as extra boatmen to carry stores provisions and new axes to a camp of rattan cutters some distance up the river a three days expedition he would test him now in that way he said negligently i want you to start at once for the camp with surat for the kavitan one dollar a day the man appeared plunged in dull hesitation but almayer who knew his malays felt pretty sure from his aspect that nothing would induce the fellow to go he urged it is important and if you are swift i shall give two dollars for the last day no tuan we do not go said the man in a hoarse whisper why we start on another journey where to a place we know of said mahmat a little louder in a stubborn manner and looking at the floor almayer experienced a feeling of immense joy he said with affected annoyance you men live in my house and it is as if it were your own i may want my house soon mahmat looked up we are men of the sea and care not for a roof when we have a canoe that will hold three and a paddle apiece the sea is our house peace be with you tuan he turned and went away rapidly and almayer heard him directly afterwards in the courtyard calling to the watchman to open the gate mahmat passed through the gate in silence but before the bar had been put up behind him he had made up his mind that if the white man ever wanted to eject him from his hut he would burn it and also as many of the white other buildings as he could safely get at and he began to call his brothers before he was inside the dilapidated dwelling well muttered almayer to himself taking some loose java tobacco from a drawer in the table now if anything comes out i am clear i asked the man to go up the river i urged him he will say so himself good he began to charge the china bowl of his pipe a pipe with a long cherry stem and a curved mouthpiece pressing the tobacco down with his thumb and thinking no i see her again want to i will give her a good start then go in chase and send an express boat after father yes it the girl in the chicken coop the wind blew hard and joggled the water of the ocean sending ripples across its surface then the wind pushed the edges of the ripples until they became waves and shoved the waves around until they became billows the billows rolled dreadfully high higher even than the tops of houses some of them indeed rolled as high as the tops of tall trees and seemed like mountains and the gulfs between the great billows were like deep valleys all this mad dashing and splashing of the waters of the big ocean which the mischievous wind caused without any good reason whatever resulted in a terrible storm and a storm on the ocean is liable to cut many queer pranks and do a lot of damage at the time the wind began to blow a ship was sailing far out upon the waters when the waves began to tumble and toss and to grow bigger and bigger the ship rolled up and down and tipped sidewise first one way and then the other and was jostled around so roughly that even the had to hold fast to the ropes and railings to keep themselves from being swept away by the wind or pitched headlong into the sea and the clouds were so thick in the sky that the sunlight couldn't get through them so that the day grew dark as night which added to the terrors of the storm the captain of the ship was not afraid because he had seen storms before and had sailed his ship through them in safety but he knew that his passengers would be in danger if they tried to stay on deck so he put them all into the cabin and told them to stay there until after the storm was over and to keep brave hearts and not be scared and all would be well with them now among these passengers was a little kansas girl named dorothy gale who was going with her uncle henry to australia to visit some relatives they had never before seen uncle henry you must know was not very well because he had been working so hard on his kansas farm that his health had given way and left him weak and nervous so he left aunt em at home to watch after the hired men and to take care of the farm while he traveled far away to australia to visit his cousins and have a good rest dorothy was eager to go with him on this journey and uncle henry thought she would be good company and help cheer him up so he decided to take her along the little girl was quite an experienced traveller for she had once been carried by a cyclone as far away from home as the marvelous land of oz and she had met with a good many adventures in that strange country before she managed to get back to kansas again so she wasn't easily frightened whatever happened and when the wind began to howl and whistle and the waves began to tumble and toss our little girl didn't mind the uproar the least bit of course we'll have to stay in the cabin she said to uncle henry and the other passengers and keep as quiet as possible until the storm is over for the captain says if we go on deck we may be blown overboard no one wanted to risk such an accident as that you may be sure so all the passengers stayed huddled up in the dark cabin listening to the shrieking of the storm and the creaking of the masts and rigging and trying to keep from bumping into one another when the ship tipped sidewise dorothy had almost fallen asleep when she was aroused with a start to find that uncle henry was missing she couldn't imagine where he had gone and as he was not very strong she began to worry about him and to fear he might have been careless enough to go on deck in that case he would be in great danger unless he instantly came down again the fact was that uncle henry had gone to lie down in his little but dorothy did not know that she only remembered that aunt em had cautioned her to take good care of her uncle so at once she decided to go on deck and find him in spite of the fact that the tempest was now worse than ever and the ship was plunging in a really dreadful manner indeed the little girl found it was as much as she could do to mount the stairs to the deck and as soon as she got there the wind struck her so fiercely that it almost tore away the skirts of her dress yet dorothy felt a sort of joyous excitement in defying the storm and while she held fast to the railing she peered around through the gloom and thought she saw the dim form of a man clinging to a mast not far away from her this might be her uncle so she called as loudly as she could uncle henry uncle henry ii you remember me now at mrs she threw the question at darrow across a table of the quiet to which after a vainly prolonged quest for her trunk he had suggested taking her for a cup of tea in this musty retreat she had removed her dripping hat hung it on the fender to dry and stretched herself on tiptoe in front of the round mirror above the mantel vases of dyed immortelles while she ran her fingers through her hair the gesture had acted on numb feelings as the glow of the fire acted on his circulation and when he had asked your feet wet too and after frank inspection of a sole she had answered cheerfully no luckily i had on my new boots he began to feel that human intercourse would still be tolerable if it were always as free from formality the removal of his hat besides provoking this reflection gave him his first full sight of her face and this was so favourable that the name she now pronounced fell on him with a quite disproportionate shock of dismay oh mrs was it there he remembered her now of course remembered her as one of the shadowy sidling presences in the background of that awful house in chelsea one of the dumb appendages of the shrieking unescapable mrs murrett into whose talons he had fallen in the course of his pursuit of lady ulrica crispin oh the taste of stale follies how insipid it was yet how it clung i used to pass you on the stairs she reminded him yes he had seen her slip by he recalled it now as he dashed up to the in quest of lady ulrica the thought made him steal a longer look how could such a face have been merged in the murrett mob its fugitive slanting lines that lent themselves to all manner of tender tilts and foreshortenings had the freakish grace of some young head of the italian comedy the hair stood up from her forehead in a boyish and its colour matched her auburn eyes flecked with black and the little brown spot on her cheek between the ear that was meant to have a rose behind it and the chin that should have rested on a ruff when she smiled the left corner of her mouth went up a little higher than the right and her smile began in her eyes and ran down to her lips in two lines of light he had dashed past that to reach lady ulrica crispin but of course you remember me she was saying my name is viner sophy viner not remember her but of course he did he was genuinely sure of it now mrs niece he declared she shook her head no not even that only her reader her reader do you mean to say she ever reads miss viner enjoyed his wonder dear no but i wrote notes and made up the and walked the dogs and saw bores for her darrow groaned that must have been rather bad yes but nothing like as bad as being her niece that i can well believe glad to hear he added that you put it all in the past tense she seemed to droop a little at the allusion then she lifted her chin with a jerk of defiance yes all is at an end between us just parted in tears but not in silence just parted do you mean to say been there all this time ever since you used to come there to see lady ulrica does it seem to you so awfully long ago the unexpectedness of the thrust as well as its doubtful taste chilled his growing enjoyment of her chatter he had really been getting to like her had recovered under the candid approval of her eye his usual sense of being a personable young man with all the privileges pertaining to the state instead of the anonymous rag of humanity he had felt himself in the crowd on the pier it annoyed him at that particular moment to be reminded that naturalness is not always consonant with taste she seemed to guess his thought you like my saying that you came for lady ulrica she asked leaning over the table to pour herself a second cup of tea he liked her quickness at any rate better he laughed than your thinking i came for mrs murrett oh we never thought anybody came for mrs murrett it was always for something else the music or the cook when there was a good one or the other people generally one of the other people i see she was amusing and that in his present mood was more to his purpose than the exact shade of her taste it was odd too to discover suddenly that the blurred tapestry of mrs background had all the while been alive and full of eyes now with a pair of them looking into his he was conscious of a queer reversal of perspective who were the we were you a cloud of witnesses there were a good many of us she smiled let me see who was there in your time mrs bolt and mademoiselle and professor didymus and the polish countess you remember the polish countess she and played accompaniments and mrs murrett chucked her because mrs didymus accused her of hypnotizing the professor but of course you remember we were all invisible to you but we could see and we all used to wonder about you xix we went straight to the lake as it was called at bly and i daresay rightly called though i reflect that it may in fact have been a sheet of water less remarkable than it appeared to my untraveled eyes my acquaintance with sheets of water was small and the pool of bly at all events on the few occasions of my consenting under the protection of my pupils to affront its surface in the old boat moored there for our use had impressed me both with its extent and its agitation the usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the house but i had an intimate conviction that wherever flora might be she was not near home she had not given me the slip for any small adventure and since the day of the very great one that i had shared with her by the pond i had been aware in our walks of the quarter to which she most inclined this was why i had now given to mrs steps so marked a direction a direction that made her when she perceived it oppose a resistance that showed me she was freshly mystified going to the water miss you think in she may be though the depth is i believe nowhere very great but what i judge most likely is that on the spot from which the other day we saw together what i told you when she pretended not to see with that astounding always been sure she wanted to go back alone and now her brother has managed it for her mrs grose still stood where she had stopped you suppose they really talk of them i could meet this with a confidence they say things that if we heard them would simply appall us and if she is there yes then miss jessel is beyond a doubt you shall see oh thank you my friend cried planted so firm that taking it in i went straight on without her by the time i reached the pool however she was close behind me and i knew that whatever to her apprehension might befall me the exposure of my society struck her as her least danger she exhaled a moan of relief as we at last came in sight of the greater part of the water without a sight of the child there was no trace of flora on that nearer side of the bank where my observation of her had been most startling and none on the opposite edge where save for a margin of some twenty yards a thick copse came down to the water the pond oblong in shape had a width so scant compared to its length that with its ends out of view it might have been taken for a scant river we looked at the empty expanse and then i felt the suggestion of my eyes i knew what she meant and i replied with a negative headshake no no wait she has taken the boat my companion stared at the vacant mooring place and then again across the lake then where is it our not seeing it is the strongest of proofs she has used it to go over and then has managed to hide it all alone that child not alone and at such times not a child an old old woman i scanned all the visible shore while mrs grose took again into the queer element i offered her one of her plunges of submission then i pointed out that the boat might perfectly be in a small refuge formed by one of the recesses of the pool an indentation masked for the hither side by a projection of the bank and by a clump of trees growing close to the water but if the there where on she my colleague anxiously asked exactly what we must learn and i started to walk further by going all the way round certainly far as it is it will take us but ten minutes but far enough to have made the child prefer not to walk she went straight over laws cried my friend again the chain of my logic was ever too much for her it dragged her at my heels even now and when we had got halfway round a devious tiresome process on ground much broken and by a path choked with overgrowth i paused to give her breath i sustained her with a grateful arm assuring her that she might hugely help me and this started us afresh so that in the course of but few minutes more we reached a point from which we found the boat to be where i had supposed it it had been intentionally left as much as possible out of sight and was tied to one of the stakes of a fence that came just there down to the brink and that had been an assistance to disembarking i recognized as i looked at the pair of short thick oars quite safely drawn up the prodigious character of the feat for a little girl but i had lived by this time too long among wonders and had panted to too many livelier measures there was a gate in the fence through which we passed and that brought us after a trifling interval more into the open then there she is we both exclaimed at once introduction the author does not intend to apologize for what many readers may call the brutality of the story but rather to explain that its wild spirit is true to the life of the western border as it was known only a little more than one hundred years ago the writer is the fortunate possessor of historical material of undoubted truth and interest it is the journal of colonel ebenezer zane one of the most prominent of the who labored in the settlement of the western country the story of that tragic period deserves a higher place in historical literature than it has thus far been given and this unquestionably because of a lack of authentic data regarding the conquering of the wilderness considering how many years the pioneers struggled on the border of this country the history of their efforts is meager and obscure if the years at the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century were full of stirring adventure on the part of the colonists along the atlantic coast how crowded must they have been for the almost forgotten pioneers who daringly invaded the trackless wilds none there was to chronicle the fight of these sturdy travelers toward the setting sun the story of their stormy lives of their heroism and of their sacrifice for the benefit of future generations is too little known it is to a better understanding of those days that the author has labored to draw from his ancestor's notes a new and striking portrayal of the frontier one which shall paint the fever of freedom that powerful impulse which lured so many to unmarked graves one which shall show his work his love the effect of the causes which rendered his life so hard and surely one which does not forget the wronged indian the frontier in produced white men so savage as to be men in name only these outcasts and renegades lived among the savages and during thirty years harassed the border perpetrating all manner of fiendish cruelties upon the settlers they were no less cruel to the redmen whom they ruled and at the height of their bloody careers made futile the moravian missionaries long labors and destroyed the beautiful hamlet of the christian indians called gnaddenhutten or village of peace and while the border produced such outlaws so did it produce hunters eke boone the zanes the mccollochs and wetzel that strange silent man whose deeds are still whispered in the country where he once roamed in his insatiate pursuit of savages and renegades and who was purely a product of the times civilization could not have brought forth a man like wetzel great revolutions great crises great moments come and produce the men to deal with them the border needed wetzel the settlers would have needed many more years in which to make permanent homes had it not been for him he was never a pioneer but always a hunter after indians when not on the track of the savage foe he was in the settlement with his keen eye and ear ever alert for signs of the enemy to the superstitious indians he was a shadow a spirit of the border which breathed menace from the dark forests to the settlers he was the right arm of defense a fitting leader for those few implacable and unerring frontiersmen who made the settlement of the west a possibility and if this story of one of his relentless pursuits shows the man as he truly was loved by pioneers respected and feared by redmen and hated by renegades if it softens a little the ruthless name history accords him the writer will have been well repaid z g the spirit of the border chapter i nell i'm growing powerful fond of you so you must be master joe if often telling makes it true the girl spoke simply and with an absence of that roguishness which was characteristic of her playful words arch smiles and a touch of coquetry had seemed natural to nell but now her grave tone and her almost wistful glance disconcerted joe during all the long journey over the mountains she had been gay and bright while now when they were about to part perhaps never to meet again she showed him the deeper and more earnest side of her character it checked his boldness as nothing else had done suddenly there came to him the real meaning of a woman's love when she bestows it without reservation silenced by the thought that he had not understood her at all and the knowledge that he had been half in sport he gazed out over the wild country before them the scene impressed its quietness upon the young couple and brought more forcibly to their minds the fact that they were at the gateway of the unknown west that somewhere beyond this rude frontier settlement out there in those unbroken forests stretching dark and silent before them was to be their future home from the high bank where they stood the land sloped and narrowed gradually until it ended in a sharp point which marked the last bit of land between the allegheny and monongahela rivers here these swift streams merged and formed the broad ohio the river even here at its beginning proud and swelling as if already certain of its grandeur swept majestically round a wide curve and apparently lost itself in the forest foliage to the reader at the very outset of the writer's literary career a friend long since dead gave him the subject of this study later on he found the same story in a collection published about the beginning of the present century to the best of his belief it is some stray fancy of the brain of hoffmann of berlin probably it appeared in some german almanac and was omitted in the published editions of his collected works the comedie humaine is sufficiently rich in original creations for the author to own to this innocent piece of plagiarism when like the worthy la fontaine he has told unwittingly and after his own fashion a tale already related by another this is not one of the hoaxes in vogue in the year when every author wrote his tale of horror for the amusement of young ladies when you have read the account of don juan's decorous parricide try to picture to yourself the part which would be played under very similar circumstances by honest folk who in this nineteenth century will take a man's money and undertake to pay him a life annuity on the faith of a chill or let a house to an ancient lady for the term of her natural life would they be for resuscitating their clients i should dearly like a connoisseur in consciences to consider how far there is a resemblance between a don juan and fathers who marry their children to great expectations does humanity which according to certain philosophers is making progress look on the art of waiting for dead men's shoes as a step in the right direction to this art we owe several honorable professions which open up ways of living on death there are people who rely entirely on an expected demise who brood over it crouching each morning upon a corpse that serves again for their pillow at night to this class belong bishops coadjutors cardinals supernumeraries tontiniers and the like add to the list many delicately scrupulous persons eager to buy landed property beyond their means who calculate with dry logic and in cold blood the probable duration of the life of a father or of a some old man or woman of eighty or ninety saying to themselves i shall be sure to come in for it in three years time and then a murderer is less loathsome to us than a spy the murderer may have acted on a sudden mad impulse he may be penitent and amend but a spy is always a spy night and day in bed at table as he walks abroad his vileness pervades every moment of his life then what must it be to live when every moment of your life is tainted with murder and have we not just admitted that a host of human creatures in our midst are led by our laws customs and usages to dwell without ceasing on a death there are men who put the weight of a coffin into their deliberations as they bargain for cashmere shawls for their wives as they go up the staircase of a theatre or think of going to the bouffons or of setting up a carriage who are murderers in thought when dear ones with the irresistible charm of innocence hold up childish foreheads to be kissed with a father hourly they meet the gaze of eyes that they would fain close for ever eyes that still open each morning to the light like belvidero's in this study god alone knows the number of those who are parricides in thought picture to yourself the state of mind of a man who must pay a life annuity to some old woman whom he scarcely knows both live in the country with a brook between them both sides are free to hate cordially without offending against the social conventions that require two brothers to wear a mask if the older will succeed to the entail and the other to the fortune of a younger son the whole civilization of europe turns upon the principle of hereditary succession as upon a pivot it would be madness to subvert the principle but could we not in an age that prides itself upon its mechanical inventions perfect this essential portion of the social machinery if the author has preserved the style of address to the reader before a work wherein he endeavors to represent all literary forms it is for the purpose of making a remark that applies to several of the studies and very specially to this every one of his compositions has been based upon ideas more or less novel which as it seemed to him needed literary expression he can claim priority for certain forms and for certain ideas which have since passed into the domain of literature and have there in some instances become common property so that the date of the first publication of each study cannot be a matter of indifference to those of his readers who would fain do him justice reading brings us unknown friends and what friend is like a reader we have friends in our own circle who read nothing of ours the author hopes to pay his debt by dedicating this work diis ignotis chapter ix queen alice well this is grand said alice i never expected i should be a queen so soon and tell you what it is your majesty she went on in a severe tone she was always rather fond of scolding herself never do for you to be lolling about on the grass like that queens have to be dignified you know so she got up and walked about rather stiffly just at first as she was afraid that the crown might come off but she comforted herself with the thought that there was nobody to see her and if i really am a queen she said as she sat down again i shall be able to manage it quite well in time everything was happening so oddly that she feel a bit surprised at finding the red queen and the white queen sitting close to her one on each side she would have liked very much to ask them how they came there but she feared it would not be quite civil however there would be no harm she thought in asking if the game was over please would you tell me she began looking timidly at the red queen speak when spoken to the queen sharply interrupted her but if everybody obeyed that rule said alice who was always ready for a little argument and if you only spoke when you were spoken to and the other person always waited for you to begin you see nobody would ever say anything so that ridiculous cried the queen why you see child here she broke off with a frown and after thinking for a minute suddenly changed the subject of the conversation what do you mean by if you really are a queen what right have you to call yourself so you be a queen you know till passed the proper examination and the sooner we begin it the better i only said if poor alice pleaded in a piteous tone the two queens looked at each other and the red queen remarked with a little shudder she says she only said if but she said a great deal more than that the white queen moaned wringing her hands oh ever so much more than that so you did you know the red queen said to alice always speak the truth think before you speak and write it down afterwards sure i mean alice was beginning but the red queen interrupted her impatiently just what i complain of you should have meant what do you suppose is the use of child without any meaning even a joke should have some meaning and a more important than a joke i hope you deny that even if you tried with both hands i deny things with my hands alice objected nobody said you did said the red queen i said you if you tried in that state of mind said the white queen that she wants to deny something only she know what to deny a nasty vicious temper the red queen remarked and then there was an uncomfortable silence for a minute or two the red queen broke the silence by saying to the white queen i invite you to this afternoon the white queen smiled feebly and said and i invite you i know i was to have a party at all said alice but if there is to be one i think i ought to invite the guests we gave you the opportunity of doing it the red queen remarked but i daresay not had many lessons in manners yet manners are not taught in lessons said alice lessons teach you to do sums and things of that sort and you do addition the white queen asked one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one i know said alice i lost count she do addition the red queen interrupted can you do subtraction take nine from eight nine from eight i you know alice replied very readily but she do subtraction said the white queen can you do division divide a loaf by a knife the answer to that i suppose alice was beginning but the red queen answered for her of course try another subtraction sum take a bone from a dog what remains alice considered the bone remain of course if i took it and the dog remain it would come to bite me and sure i remain then you think nothing would remain said the red queen i think the answer wrong as usual said the red queen the temper would remain but i see how why look here the red queen cried the dog would lose its temper it perhaps it would alice replied cautiously then if the dog went away its temper would remain the queen exclaimed triumphantly alice said as gravely as she could they might go different ways but she help thinking to herself what dreadful nonsense we are talking she do sums a bit the queens said together with great emphasis can you do sums alice said turning suddenly on the white queen for she like being found fault with so much iv though the town seemed to carol to change no more than the surrounding fields there was a constant shifting these three years the citizen of the prairie drifts always westward it may be because he is the heir of ancient migrations and it may be because he finds within his own spirit so little adventure that he is driven to seek it by changing his horizon the towns remain unvaried yet the individual faces alter like classes in college the gopher prairie jeweler sells out for no discernible reason and moves on to alberta or the state of washington to open a shop precisely like his former one in a town precisely like the one he has left there is except among professional men and the wealthy small permanence either of residence or occupation a man becomes farmer grocer town policeman garageman postmaster and farmer all over again and the community more or less patiently suffers from his lack of knowledge in each of his experiments ole jenson the grocer and dahl the butcher moved on to south dakota and idaho luke and mrs dawson picked up ten thousand acres of prairie soil in the magic portable form of a small check book and went to pasadena to a bungalow and sunshine and cafeterias chet dashaway sold his furniture and undertaking business and wandered to los angeles where the dauntless reported our good friend chester has accepted a fine position with a firm and his wife has in the charming social circles of the queen city of the southwestland that same popularity which she enjoyed in our own society sets rita simons was married to terry gould and rivaled juanita haydock as the gayest of the young married set but juanita also acquired merit harry's father died harry became senior partner in the bon ton store and juanita was more acidulous and shrewd and cackling than ever she bought an evening frock and exposed her to the wonder of the jolly seventeen and talked of moving to minneapolis to defend her position against the new mrs terry gould she sought to attach carol to her faction by giggling that some folks might call rita innocent but i've got a hunch that she isn't half as ignorant of things as brides are supposed to be and of course terry isn't as a doctor alongside of your husband carol herself would gladly have followed mr ole jenson and migrated even to another main street flight from familiar tedium to new tedium would have for a time the outer look and promise of adventure she hinted to kennicott of the probable medical advantages of montana and oregon she knew that he was satisfied with gopher prairie but it gave her vicarious hope to think of going to ask for railroad folders at the station to trace the maps with a restless forefinger yet to the casual eye she was not discontented she was not an abnormal and distressing traitor to the faith of main street the settled citizen believes that the rebel is constantly in a stew of complaining and hearing of a carol kennicott he gasps what an awful person she must be a holy terror to live with glad my folks are satisfied with things way they are actually it was not so much as five minutes a day that carol devoted to lonely desires it is probable that the agitated citizen has within his circle at least one inarticulate rebel with aspirations as wayward as carol's the presence of the baby had made her take gopher prairie and the brown house seriously as natural places of residence she pleased kennicott by being friendly with the complacent maturity of mrs clark and mrs elder and when she had often enough been in conference upon the elders new cadillac car or the job which the oldest clark boy had taken in the office of the these topics became important things to follow up day by day with of her emotion concentrated upon hugh she did not criticize shops streets acquaintances this year or two she hurried to uncle whittier's store for a package of she abstractedly listened to uncle whittier's denunciation of martin mahoney for asserting that the wind last tuesday had been south and not southwest she came back along streets that held no surprises nor the startling faces of strangers thinking of hugh's teething all the way she did not reflect that this store these drab blocks made up all her background she did her work and she triumphed over winning from the clarks at five hundred the most considerable event of the two years after the birth of hugh occurred when vida sherwin resigned from the high school and was married carol was her attendant and as the wedding was at the episcopal church all the women wore new kid slippers and long white kid gloves and looked refined for years carol had been little sister to vida and had never in the least known to what degree vida loved her and hated her and in curious strained ways was bound to her chapter xxi i gray steel that seems unmoving because it spins so fast in the balanced gray snow in an avenue of elms gray dawn with the sun behind it this was the gray of vida sherwin's life at the story of weng cho or the one devoid of name there was in the orchards of a blue sky above and in the air much gladness but in wu yamen gloom hung like the herald of a thunderstorm at one end of a table in the ceremonial hall sat wu chi heaviness upon his brow deceit in his eyes and a sour enmity about the lines of his mouth at the other end stood his son weng and between them as it were his whole life lay wu chi was an official of some consequence and had two wives as became him his union with the first had failed in its essential purpose therefore he had taken another to carry on the direct line which alone could bring him contentment in this world and a reputable existence in the next this degree of happiness was supplied by mother yet she must ever remain but a secondary wife with no rights and a very insecure position in the heart of the chief wife smouldered a most bitter hatred but the hour of her ascendancy came for after many years she also bore her lord a son thenceforward she was strong in her authority but mother remained for she was very beautiful and despite all the arts of the other woman wu chi could not be prevailed upon to dismiss her the easy solution of this difficulty was that she soon died the white powder death was the shrewd comment of the inner chambers of wu chi put on no mourning custom did not require it and now that the woman had passed beyond he saw no necessity to honour her memory at the expense of his own domestic peace his wife donned her gayest robes and made a feast weng alone stood apart and in funereal sackcloth moved through the house like an accusing ghost each day his father met him with a frown the woman whom alone he must regard as his mother with a mocking smile but he passed them without any word of dutiful and submissive greeting the period of all seemly mourning ended it touched that allotted to a legal parent still weng cast himself down and made no pretence to hide his grief his frown became a scowl his smile framed a biting word a wise and venerable friend who loved the youth took him aside one day and with many sympathetic words counselled restraint for he said your conduct though affectionate towards the dead may be urged by the as disrespectful towards the living if you have a deeper end in view strive towards it by a less open path you are subtle and esteemed in wisdom replied weng but neither of those virtues can restore a broken jar the wayside fountain must one day dry up at its source but until then not even a mountain placed upon its mouth can pen back its secret stores so is it with unfeigned grief the analogy may be exact replied the aged friend shaking his head but it is no less truly said the wise tortoise keeps his pain inside rest assured on the disinterested advice of one who has no great experience of mountains and hidden springs but a knowledge of wu chi and of his amiable wife that if you mourn too much you will have reason to mourn more his words were pointed to a sharp edge at that moment wu chi was being confronted by his wife who stood before him in his inner chamber who am i she exclaimed vehemently that my authority should be denied before my very eyes am i indeed che of the house of meng whose ancestors wore the yellow scabbard or am i some nameless one or does my lord sleep or has he fallen blind upon the side by which weng approaches his heart is bad and his instincts perverted replied wu chi dully he ignores the rites custom and the example and sets at defiance all the principles of domestic government do not fear that i shall not shortly call him to account with a very heavy call do so my lord said his wife darkly or many valiant champions of the house of meng may press forward to make a cast of that same account to those of our ancient line it would not seem a trivial thing that their daughter should share her rights with a purchased slave peace cockatrice the woman was well enough exclaimed wu chi with slow resentment but the matter of this obstinacy touches the dignity of my own authority and before has passed weng shall bring up his footsteps suddenly before a solid wall accordingly when weng returned at his usual hour he found his father awaiting him with curbed impatience that wu chi should summon him into his presence in the great hall was of itself an omen that the matter was one of moment but the profusion of lights before the ancestral tablets and the various symbols arranged upon the table showed that the occasion was to be regarded as one involving irrevocable issues weng cho said his father dispassionately from his seat at the head of the table draw near and first pledge the ancient ones whose spirits hover above their tablets in a vessel of wine chapter iii a few weeks later coming early one morning into singapore from a journey to the southward i saw the brig lying at anchor in all her usual symmetry and splendour of aspect as though she had been taken out of a glass case and put delicately into the water that very moment she was well out in the roadstead but i steamed in and took up my habitual berth close in front of the town before we had finished breakfast a came to tell me that captain boat was coming our way his smart gig dashed alongside and in two bounds he was up our and shaking me by the hand with his nervous grip his eyes snapping inquisitively for he supposed i had called at the seven isles group on my way i reached into my pocket for a nicely folded little note which he grabbed out of my hand without ceremony and carried off on the bridge to read by himself after a decent interval i followed him up there and found him pacing to and fro for the nature of his emotions made him restless even in his most thoughtful moments he shook his head at me triumphantly well my dear boy he said i shall be counting the days now i understood what he meant i knew that those young people had settled already on a runaway match without official preliminaries this was really a logical decision old nelson or nielsen would never have agreed to give up freya peaceably to this compromising jasper heavens what would the dutch authorities say to such a match it sounds too ridiculous for words but nothing in the world more selfishly hard than a timorous man in a fright about his little estate as old nelson used to call it in apologetic accents a heart permeated by a particular sort of funk is proof against sense feeling and ridicule a flint jasper would have made his request all the same and then taken his own way but it was freya who decided that nothing should be said on the ground that papa would only worry himself to distraction he was capable of making himself ill and then she have the heart to leave him here you have the sanity of feminine outlook and the frankness of feminine reasoning and for the rest miss freya could read poor dear papa in the way a woman reads a man like an open book his daughter once gone old nelson would not worry himself he would raise a great outcry and make no end of lamentable fuss but not the same thing the real agonies of indecision the anguish of conflicting feelings would be spared to him and as he was too unassuming to rage he would after a period of lamentation devote himself to his little estate and to keeping on good terms with the authorities time would do the rest and freya thought she could afford to wait while ruling over her own home in the beautiful brig and over the man who loved her this was the life for her who had learned to walk on a deck she was a a if ever there was one and of course she loved jasper and trusted him but there was a shade of anxiety in her pride it is very fine and romantic to possess for your very own a finely tempered and trusty but whether it is the best weapon to counter with the common of fate another question she knew that she had the more substance of the two you try any cheap jokes i am not talking of their weights she was just a little anxious while he was away and she had me who being a tried confidant took the liberty to whisper frequently the sooner the better but there was a peculiar vein of obstinacy in miss freya and her reason for delay was characteristic not before my birthday so that there shall be no mistake in minds as to me being old enough to know what i am doing feelings were in such subjection that he had never even remonstrated against the decree she was just splendid whatever she did or said and there was an end of it for him i believe that he was subtle enough to be even flattered at bottom at times and then to console him he had the brig which seemed pervaded by the spirit of freya since whatever he did on board was always done under the supreme sanction of his love yes soon begin to count the days he repeated eleven months more have to crowd three trips into that mind you come to grief trying to do too much i admonished him but he dismissed my caution with a laugh and an elated gesture pooh nothing nothing could happen to the brig he cried as if the flame of his heart could light up the dark nights of uncharted seas and the image of freya serve for an unerring beacon amongst hidden shoals as if the winds had to wait on his future the stars fight for it in their courses as if the magic of his passion had the power to float a ship on a drop of dew or sail her through the eye of a needle simply because it was her magnificent lot to be the servant of a love so full of grace as to make all the ways of the earth safe resplendent and easy the lovely lady of light the palace of the queen of light stood on a little eminence and was a mass of crystal windows surmounted by a vast crystal dome when they entered the portals erma was greeted by six lovely maidens evidently of high degree who at once aroused betsy's admiration each bore a wand in her hand tipped with an emblem of light and their costumes were also emblematic of the lights they represented erma introduced them to her guests and each made a graceful and courteous acknowledgment first was sunlight radiantly beautiful and very fair the second was moonlight a soft dreamy damsel with hair next came starlight equally lovely but inclined to be retiring and shy these three were dressed in shimmering robes of silvery white the fourth was daylight a brilliant damsel with laughing eyes and frank manners who wore a variety of colors then came firelight clothed in a fleecy robe that wavered around her shapely form in a very attractive manner the sixth maiden electra was the most beautiful of all and betsy thought from the first that both sunlight and daylight regarded electra with envy and were a little jealous of her but all were cordial in their greetings to the strangers and seemed to regard the queen of light with much affection for they fluttered around her in a flashing radiant group as she led the way to her regal this apartment was richly and cosily furnished the upholstery being of many tints and both betsy and polychrome enjoyed resting themselves upon the downy divans after their strenuous adventures of the day the queen sat down to chat with her guests who noticed that daylight was the only maiden now seated beside erma the others had retired to another part of the room where they sat modestly with entwined arms and did not intrude themselves at all the queen told the strangers all about this beautiful land which is one of the chief residences of fairies who minister to the needs of mankind so many important fairies lived there that to avoid rivalry they had elected as their ruler the only important personage in the country who had no duties to mankind to perform and was in effect a private citizen this ruler or jinjin as was his title bore the name of and the most singular thing about him was that he had no heart but instead of this he possessed a high degree of reason and justice and while he showed no mercy in his judgments he never punished unjustly or without reason to was as terrible as he was heartless but those who were innocent of evil had nothing to fear from him all the kings and queens of this fairyland paid reverence to jinjin for as they expected to be obeyed by others they were willing to obey the one in authority over them the inhabitants of the land of oz had heard many tales of this fearfully just jinjin whose punishments were always equal to the faults committed polychrome also knew of him although this was the first time she had ever seen him face to face but to betsy the story was all new and she was greatly interested in whom she no longer feared time sped swiftly during their talk and suddenly betsy noticed that moonlight was sitting beside the queen of light instead of daylight but tell me please she pleaded why do you all wear a dragon's head embroidered on your gowns erma's pleasant face became grave as she answered the dragon as you must know was the first living creature ever made therefore the dragon is the oldest and wisest of living things by good fortune the original dragon who still lives is a resident of this land and supplies us with wisdom whenever we are in need of it he is old as the world and remembers everything that has happened since the world was created did he ever have any children inquired the girl yes many of them some wandered into other lands where men not understanding them made war upon them but many still reside in this country none however is as wise as the original dragon for whom we have great respect as he was the first resident here we wear the emblem of the dragon's head to show that we are the favored people who alone have the right to inhabit this fairyland which in beauty almost equals the fairyland of oz and in power quite surpasses it i understand about the dragon now said polychrome nodding her lovely head betsy did not quite understand but she was at present interested in observing the changing lights as daylight had given way to moonlight so now starlight sat at the right hand of erma the queen and with her coming a spirit of peace and content seemed to fill the room polychrome being herself a fairy had many questions to ask about the various kings and queens who lived in this secluded place and before erma had finished answering them a rosy glow filled the room and firelight took her place beside the queen betsy liked firelight but to gaze upon her warm and glowing features made the little girl sleepy and presently she began to nod thereupon erma rose and took betsy's hand gently in her own first period the public official the motives which inspired the actions of the devout have long been said kai lung the upon a certain occasion at and as a consequence his illustrious memory has suffered somewhat even as the insignificant may bring the precious and many coloured jewel to the surface so has it been permitted to this obscure and superficially educated one to discover the truth of the entire matter among the and frequently really illegible documents preserved at the hall of public reference at peking without fear of contradiction therefore he now sets forth the credible version was one who throughout his life had been compelled by the opposing force of circumstances to be content with what was offered rather than attain to that which he desired having been allowed to wander over the edge of an exceedingly steep crag while still a child by the aged and untrustworthy person who had the care of him and yet suffering little hurt he was carried back to the city in triumph by the one in question who to cover her neglect declared amid many chants of exultation that as he slept a majestic winged form had snatched him from her arms and traced magical figures with his body on the ground in token of the distinguished sacred existence for which he was undoubtedly set apart in such a manner he became famed at a very early age for an unassuming mildness of character and an almost inspired piety of life so that on every side frequent opportunity was given him for the display of these amiable qualities should it chance that an insufficient quantity of had been prepared for the family repast the undesirable but necessary portion of cold dried rat would inevitably be allotted to the uncomplaining quen doubtless accompanied by the engaging but unnecessary remark that he alone had a intellect which was fixed upon more sublime images than even the best constructed should the number of not be sufficient to bear to the exhibition of kites all who were desirous of becoming entertained in such a fashion inevitably would quen be the one left behind in order that he might have adequate leisure for dignified and internal reflexion in this manner it came about that when a very wealthy but unnaturally avaricious and person who was connected with father in matters of commerce expressed his fixed determination that the most deserving and enlightened of his sons should enter into a marriage agreement with his daughter there was no manner of hesitation among those concerned who admitted without any questioning between themselves that quen was undeniably the one referred to though naturally not possessing an insignificant intellect a continuous habit together with a most irreproachable sense of filial duty subdued within internal organs whatever reluctance he might have otherwise displayed in the matter so that as courteously as was necessary he presented to the undoubtedly very ordinary and maiden in question the gifts of irretrievable intention and honourably carried out his spoken and written words towards her for a period of years the circumstances of the various persons did not in any degree change quen in the meantime becoming more and with each after the manner of the sublime who studied to maintain an unmoved endurance in all varieties of events by placing his body to a greater extent each day in a vessel of boiling liquid nevertheless the good and charitable deities to whom quen unceasingly sacrificed were not altogether unmindful of his virtues for a son was born and an evil disease which arose from a most undignified display of uncontrollable emotion on her part ended in his wife being deposited with becoming ceremony in the family temple upon a certain evening when quen sat in his inner chamber deliberating upon the really beneficent yet somewhat inexplicable arrangement of the ones to whom he was very amiably disposed in consequence of the unwonted tranquillity which he now enjoyed yet who it appeared to him could have set out the entire matter in a much more satisfactory way from the beginning he was made aware by the unexpected beating of many gongs and by other signs of refined and deferential welcome that a person of exalted rank was approaching his residence while he was still hesitating in his uncertainty regarding the most courteous and delicate form of with which to honour so important a visitor whether to rush forth and allow the to pass over his prostrate form to make a pretence of being a slave and in that guise doing menial service or to conceal himself beneath a massive and overhanging table until his guest should have availed himself of the opportunity to examine at his leisure whatever the room contained the person in question stood before him in every detail of dress and appointment he had the undoubted appearance of being one to whom no door might be safely closed alas exclaimed quen how inferior and is the mind of a person of my feeble intellectual attainments even at this moment when the near approach of one who obviously commands every engaging accomplishment might reasonably be expected to call up within it an adequate amount of commonplace resource its possessor finds himself entirely incapable of conducting himself with the fitting outward marks of his great internal respect this residence is certainly unprepossessing in the extreme yet it contains many objects of some value and of great rarity illiterate as this person is he would not be so presumptuous as to offer any for your acceptance but if you will confer upon him the favour of selecting that which appears to be the most priceless and unreplaceable he will immediately and with every manifestation of extreme delight break it irredeemably in your honour to prove the unaffected depth of his gratified emotions she took arm and went towards a sofa in the i want you to go to the marquis she said jacques my footman will go with you he has a letter that you will take i am asking the marquis to give my letters back to me he will give them all up i like to think that when you have my letters go up to my room with them some one shall bring me word she rose to go to meet the duchesse de langeais her most intimate friend who had come like the rest of the world rastignac went he asked for the marquis at the hotel rochefide feeling certain that the latter would be spending his evening there and so it proved the marquis went to his own house with rastignac and gave a casket to the student saying as he did so they are all there he seemed as if he was about to say something to eugene to ask about the ball or the vicomtesse perhaps he was on the brink of the confession that even then he was in despair and knew that his marriage had been a fatal mistake but a proud gleam shone in his eyes and with deplorable courage he kept his noblest feelings a secret do not even mention my name to her my dear eugene he grasped hand sadly and affectionately and turned away from him eugene went back to the hotel beauseant the servant took him to the room there were signs there of preparations for a journey he sat down by the fire fixed his eyes on the cedar wood casket and fell into deep mournful musings mme de beauseant loomed large in these imaginings like a goddess in the iliad ah my friend said the vicomtesse she crossed the room and laid her hand on shoulder he saw the tears in his uplifted eyes saw that one hand was raised to take the casket and that the fingers of the other trembled suddenly she took the casket put it in the fire and watched it burn they are dancing she said they all came very early but death will be long in coming hush my friend and she laid a finger on lips seeing that he was about to speak i shall never see paris again i am taking my leave of the world at five this morning i shall set out on my journey i mean to bury myself in the remotest part of normandy i have had very little time to make my arrangements since three this afternoon i have been busy signing documents setting my affairs in order there was no one whom i could send to she broke off he was sure to be again she broke off the weight of her sorrow was more than she could bear in such moments as these everything is agony and some words are impossible to utter and so i counted upon you to do me this last piece of service this evening she said i should like to give you some pledge of friendship i shall often think of you you have seemed to me to be kind and noble and true in this world where such qualities are seldom found i should like you to think sometimes of me stay she said glancing about her there is this box that has held my gloves every time i opened it before going to a ball or to the theatre i used to feel that i must be beautiful because i was so happy and i never touched it except to lay some gracious memory in it there is so much of my old self in it of a madame de beauseant who now lives no longer will you take it i will leave directions that it is to be sent to you in the rue mme de nucingen looked very charming this evening eugene you must love her perhaps we may never see each other again my friend but be sure of this that i shall pray for you who have been kind to me now let us go downstairs people shall not think that i am weeping i have all time and eternity before me and where i am going i shall be alone and no one will ask me the reason of my tears one last look round first she stood for a moment then she covered her eyes with her hands for an instant dashed away the tears bathed her face with cold water and took the arm let us go she said this suffering endured with such noble fortitude shook eugene with a more violent emotion than he had felt before they went back to the ballroom and mme de beauseant went through the rooms on arm the last delicately gracious act of a gracious woman in another moment he saw the sisters mme de restaud and mme de nucingen the countess shone in all the glory of her magnificent diamonds every stone must have scorched like fire she was never to wear them again strong as love and pride might be in her she found it difficult to meet her eyes the sight of her was scarcely calculated to lighten sad thoughts through the blaze of those diamonds he seemed to see the wretched on which father goriot was lying the vicomtesse misread his melancholy she withdrew her hand from his arm gun bullocks those heroes in their harnesses avoid a and what they know of powder upsets them one and all then we come into action and tug the guns again make way there way for

to deal very honestly with words and with people because they are both alive show me that as in a river so in a writing clearness is the best quality and a little that is pure is worth more than much that is mixed teach me to see the local colour without being blind to the inner light give me an ideal that will stand the strain of weaving into human stuff on the loom of the real keep me from caring more for books than for folks for art than for life steady me to do my full stint of work as well as i can and when that is done stop me pay what wages thou wilt and help me to say from a quiet heart a grateful amen preface in every life worth writing about there is a ruling passion the very pulse of the machine unless you touch that you are groping around outside of reality sometimes it is romantic love natures masterpiece of interested benevolence in almost all lives this passion has its season of empire therefore and rightly it is the favourite theme of the storyteller romantic love interests almost everybody because almost everybody knows something about it or would like to know but there are other passions no less real which also have their place and power in human life some of them come earlier and sometimes they last longer than romantic love they play alongside of it and are mixed up with it now checking it now advancing its flow and tingeing it with their own colour just because love is so universal it is often to one of the other passions that we must look for the distinctive hue the individual quality of a granted if you will that everybody must fall in love or ought to fall in love how will he do it and what will he do afterwards these are questions not without interest to one who watches the human drama as a friend the answers depend upon those hidden and durable desires affections and impulses to which men and women give themselves up for rule and guidance music nature children honour strife revenge money pride friendship loyalty duty to these objects and others like them the secret power of personal passion often turns and the life unconsciously follows it as the tides in the sea follow the moon in the sky when circumstances cross the ruling passion when rocks lie in the way and winds are contrary then things happen characters emerge slight events are significant mere adventures are transformed into a real plot what care i how many scapes and moving accidents your hero may pass through unless i know him for a man he is but a puppet strung on wires his kisses are wooden and his wounds bleed sawdust there is nothing about him to remember except his name and perhaps a bit of dialect kill him or crown him what difference does it make but go the other way about your work take the least man of all mankind as i look at his head and heart find how and why he differs from his fellows utterly and now there is something to tell with a meaning if you tell it at length it is a novel a painting if you tell it in brief it is a short story an etching but the subject is always the same the unseen mysterious ruling passion weaving the stuff of human nature into patterns wherein the soul is imaged and revealed to tell about some of these ruling passions simply clearly and concretely is what i want to do in this book the characters are chosen for the most part among plain people because their feelings are expressed with fewer words and greater truth not being costumed for social effect the scene is laid on nature's stage because i like to be even when i am trying to think and learning to write avalon princeton july contents i a lover of music ii the reward of virtue iii a brave heart iv the gentle life v a friend of justice vi the white blot vii a year of nobility viii the keeper of the light i a lover of music i he entered the backwoods village of bytown literally on the wings of the wind it whirled him along like a big snowflake and dropped him at the door of moody's sportsmen's retreat as if he were a new year's gift from the north pole his coming seemed a mere chance but perhaps there was something more in it after all at all events you shall hear if you will the time and the manner of his arrival it was the last night of december some years ago all the city sportsmen who had hunted the deer under bill moody's direction had long since retreated to their homes leaving the little settlement on the border of the adirondack wilderness wholly under the social direction of the natives the annual ball was in full swing in the of the hotel at one side of the room the tables and chairs were piled up with their legs projecting in the air like a thicket of very dead trees chapter xxiv a tantalizing revelation i shall have something to tell you in the orchard this evening said the story girl at breakfast one morning her eyes were very bright and excited she looked as if she had not slept a great deal she had spent the previous evening with miss reade and had not returned until the rest of us were in bed miss reade had finished giving music lessons and was going home in a few days cecily and felicity were in despair over this and mourned as those without comfort but the story girl who had been even more devoted to miss reade than either of them had not as i noticed expressed any regret and seemed to be very cheerful over the whole matter why you tell it now asked felicity because the evening is the nicest time to tell things in i only mentioned it now so that you would have something interesting to look forward to all day is it about miss reade asked cecily never mind bet going to be married i exclaimed remembering the ring is she cried felicity and cecily together the story girl threw an annoyed glance at me she did not like to have her dramatic announcements forestalled i say that it is about miss reade or that it you must just wait till the evening i wonder what it is speculated cecily as the story girl left the room i believe much of anything said felicity beginning to clear away the breakfast dishes the story girl always likes to make so much out of so little anyhow i believe miss reade is going to be married she any beaus around here and mrs armstrong says sure she correspond with anybody besides if she was she be likely to tell the story girl oh she might such friends you know said cecily miss reade is no better friends with her than she is with me and you retorted felicity no but sometimes it seems to me that a different kind of friend with the story girl than she is with me and you reflected cecily i just explain what i mean no wonder such nonsense sniffed felicity only some secret anyway said dan loftily i feel much interest in it but he was on hand with the rest of us that evening interest or no interest in uncle walk where the ripening apples were beginning to glow like jewels among the boughs now are you going to tell us your news asked felicity impatiently miss reade is going to be married said the story girl she told me so last night she is going to be married in a time who to exclaimed the girls to the story girl threw a defiant glance at me as if to say you spoil the surprise of this anyway tothe awkward man for a few moments amazement literally held us dumb not in earnest sara stanley gasped felicity at last indeed i am i thought be astonished but i suspected it all summer from little things noticed you remember that evening last spring when i went a piece with miss reade and told you when i came back that a story was growing i guessed it from the way the awkward man looked at her when i stopped to speak to him over his garden fence but the awkward man said felicity helplessly it seem possible did miss reade tell you herself yes i suppose it must be true then but how did it ever come about so shy and awkward how did he ever manage to get up enough spunk to ask her to marry him maybe she asked him suggested dan the story girl looked as if she might tell if she would i believe that was the way of it i said to draw her on not exactly she said reluctantly i know all about it but i tell you i guessed part from things seen and miss reade told me a good deal and the awkward man himself told me his side of it as we came home last night i met him just as i left mr and we were together as far as his house it was dark and he just talked on as if he were talking to himself i think he forgot i was there at all once he got started he has never been shy or awkward with me but he never talked as he did last night you might tell us what he said urged cecily never tell the story girl shook her head no i you understand besides i tell it just right one of the things that are hardest to tell spoil it if i told it now perhaps some day be able to tell it properly very beautiful but it might sound very ridiculous if it told just exactly the right way i know what you mean and i believe you know yourself said felicity pettishly all that i can make out is that miss reade is going to marry jasper dale and i like the idea one bit she is so beautiful and sweet i thought marry some dashing young man jasper dale must be nearly twenty years older than her and so queer and shy and such a hermit chapter xvii retiring from the megaphones were constructed out of heavy and penrod sam and herman set out in different directions delivering vocally the inflammatory proclamation of the poster to a large section of the residential quarter and leaving roderick magsworth bitts junior with verman in the loft shielded from all deadhead eyes upon the return of the heralds the schofield and williams military band played deafeningly and an awakened public once more thronged to fill the coffers of the firm prosperity smiled again the very first audience after the acquisition of roderick was larger than the largest of the morning master bitts the only exhibit placed upon a box was a supercurio all eyes fastened upon him and remained hungrily feasting throughout penrod's luminous oration but the glory of one light must ever be the dimming of another we dwell in a vale of seesaws and cobwebs spin fastest upon laurel verman the tattooed wild boy speaking only in his native foreign languages verman the gay verman the caperer capered no more he chuckled no more he beckoned no more nor tapped his chest nor wreathed his idolatrous face in smiles gone all gone were his little artifices for attracting the general attention to himself gone was every engaging mannerism which had endeared him to the mercurial public he squatted against the wall and glowered at the new sensation it was the old story the old old story of too much temperament verman was suffering from artistic jealousy the second audience contained a adult a spectacled young man whose poignant attention was very flattering he remained after the lecture and put a few questions to roddy which were answered rather confusedly upon promptings from penrod the young man went away without having stated the object of his interrogations but it became quite plain later in the day this same object caused the spectacled young man to make several brief but stimulating calls directly after leaving the schofield and williams big show and the consequences thereof loitered not by the wayside the big show was at high tide not only was the auditorium filled and throbbing there was an indubitable line by no means wholly juvenile waiting for admission to the next pufformance a group stood in the street examining the poster earnestly as it glowed in the long slanting rays of the westward sun and people in automobiles and other vehicles had halted wheel in the street to read the message so piquantly given to the world these were the conditions when a crested victoria arrived at a gallop and a large chastely magnificent and highly flushed woman descended and progressed across the yard with an air of violence at sight of her the adults of the waiting line hastily disappeared and most of the pausing vehicles moved instantly on their way she was followed by a stricken man in livery the stairs to the auditorium were narrow and steep mrs roderick magsworth bitts was of a stout favour and the voice of penrod was audible during the ascent gentilmun and each and all are now gazing upon roderick magsworth bitts junior the only living nephew of the great rena magsworth she stuck ars'nic in the milk of eight separate and distinck people to put in their coffee and each and all of em died the great ars'nic murderess rena magsworth gentilmun and and roddy's her only living nephew she's a relation of all the bitts family but he's her one and only living nephew next july she's goin to be hung and each and all you now see before you penrod paused abruptly seeing something before himself the august and awful presence which filled the entryway and his words it should be related froze upon his lips before herself mrs roderick magsworth bitts saw her son her scion wearing a moustache and sideburns of blue and perched upon a box flanked by sherman and verman the michigan rats the indian dog duke herman and the dog part alligator roddy also saw something before himself it needed no prophet to read the countenance of the dread apparition in the entryway his mouth opened remained open then filled to capacity with a calamitous sound of grief not unmingled with apprehension penrod's reason staggered under the crisis for a horrible moment he saw mrs roderick magsworth bitts approaching like some fatal mountain in avalanche she seemed to grow larger and redder lightnings played about her head he had a vague consciousness of the audience spraying out in flight of the squealings tramplings and dispersals of a stricken field the mountain was close upon him he stood by the open mouth of the which went through the floor to the manger below penrod also went through the floor he propelled himself into the chute and shot down but not quite to the manger for mr samuel williams had thoughtfully stepped into the chute a moment in advance of his partner penrod lit upon sam catastrophic noises resounded in the loft volcanoes seemed to romp upon the stairway there ensued a period when only a shrill keening marked the passing of roderick as he was borne to the tumbril then all was silence sunset striking through a western window rouged the walls of the schofields library where gathered a joint family council and court martial of four mrs schofield mr schofield and mr and mrs williams parents of samuel of that ilk mr williams read aloud a conspicuous passage from the last edition of the evening paper verse madonna in the louvre january the tomb of ilaria giunigi february the sonnet november two backgrounds november experience january chartres september life june an autumn sunset october afterward january i oh there is one of course but never know it the assertion laughingly flung out six months earlier in a bright june garden came back to mary boyne with a sharp perception of its latent significance as she stood in the december dusk waiting for the lamps to be brought into the library the words had been spoken by their friend alida stair as they sat at tea on her lawn at pangbourne in reference to the very house of which the library in question was the central the pivotal feature mary boyne and her husband in quest of a country place in one of the southern or southwestern counties had on their arrival in england carried their problem straight to alida stair who had successfully solved it in her own case but it was not until they had rejected almost capriciously several practical and judicious suggestions that she threw it out well lyng in dorsetshire it belongs to cousins and you can get it for a song the reasons she gave for its being obtainable on these terms its remoteness from a station its lack of electric light pipes and other vulgar necessities were exactly those pleading in its favor with two romantic americans perversely in search of the economic drawbacks which were associated in their tradition with unusual architectural felicities i should never believe i was living in an old house unless i was thoroughly uncomfortable ned boyne the more extravagant of the two had jocosely insisted the least hint of convenience would make me think it had been bought out of an exhibition with the pieces numbered and set up again and they had proceeded to enumerate with humorous precision their various suspicions and exactions refusing to believe that the house their cousin recommended was really tudor till they learned it had no heating system or that the village church was literally in the grounds till she assured them of the deplorable uncertainty of the too uncomfortable to be true edward boyne had continued to exult as the avowal of each disadvantage was successively wrung from her but he had cut short his rhapsody to ask with a sudden relapse to distrust and the ghost been concealing from us the fact that there is no ghost mary at the moment had laughed with him yet almost with her laugh being possessed of several sets of independent perceptions had noted a sudden flatness of tone in answering hilarity oh full of ghosts you know yes yes but that do i want to have to drive ten miles to see somebody ghost i want one of my own on the premises is there a ghost at lyng his rejoinder had made alida laugh again and it was then that she had flung back tantalizingly oh there is one of course but never know it never know it boyne pulled her up but what in the world constitutes a ghost except the fact of its being known for one i say but the story that a ghost but that nobody knows a ghost well not till afterward at any rate till afterward not till long long afterward but if once been identified as an unearthly visitant why its signalement been handed down in the family how has it managed to preserve its incognito alida could only shake her head ask me but it has and then suddenly mary spoke up as if from some cavernous depth of divination suddenly long afterward one says to self that was it she was oddly startled at the sepulchral sound with which her question fell on the banter of the other two and she saw the shadow of the same surprise flit across clear pupils i suppose so one just has to wait oh hang waiting ned broke in too short for a ghost who can only be enjoyed in retrospect we do better than that mary but it turned out that in the event they were not destined to for within three months of their conversation with mrs stair they were established at lyng and the life they had yearned for to the point of planning it out in all its daily details had actually begun for them it was to sit in the thick december dusk by just such a fireplace under just such black oak rafters with the sense that beyond the mullioned panes the downs were darkening to a deeper solitude it was for the ultimate indulgence in such sensations that mary boyne had endured for nearly fourteen years the ugliness of the middle west and that boyne had ground on doggedly at his engineering till with a suddenness that still made her blink the prodigious windfall of the blue star mine had put them at a stroke in possession of life and the leisure to taste it they had never for a moment meant their new state to be one of idleness but they meant to give themselves only to harmonious activities she had her vision of painting and gardening against a background of gray walls he dreamed of the production of his book on the economic basis of culture and with such absorbing work ahead no existence could be too sequestered they could not get far enough from the world or plunge deep enough into the past gloriana willow shaw the little fenced wood where the are stacked like indian wigwams had been given to dan and una for their very own kingdom when they were quite small as they grew older they contrived to keep it most particularly private even phillips the gardener told them every time that he came in to take a for his beans and old hobden would no more have thought of setting his there without leave given fresh each spring than he would have torn down the calico and marking ink notice on the big willow which said not allowed in the kingdom unless brought now you can understand their indignation when one blowy july afternoon as they were going up for a they saw somebody moving among the trees they hurled themselves over the gate dropping half the potatoes and while they were picking them up puck came out of a wigwam oh you is it said una we thought it was people i saw you were angry from your legs he answered with a grin well our own kingdom not counting you of course rather why i came a lady here wants to see you what about said dan cautiously oh just kingdoms and things she knows about kingdoms there was a lady near the fence dressed in a long dark cloak that hid everything except her high shoes her face was half covered by a black silk fringed mask without goggles and yet she did not look in the least as if she motored puck led them up to her and bowed solemnly una made the best curtsy she could remember the lady answered with a long deep slow billowy one since it seems that you are a queen of this kingdom she said i can do no less than acknowledge your sovereignty she turned sharply on staring dan in your head lad manners i was thinking how wonderfully you did that curtsy he answered she laughed a rather shrill laugh a courtier already do you know anything of dances wench or queen must i say had some lessons but i really dance a bit said una you should learn then the lady moved forward as though she would teach her at once it gives a woman alone among men or her enemies time to think how she shall win or lose a woman can only work in heigho she sat down on the bank old middenboro the pony stumped across the paddock and hung his sorrowful head over the fence a pleasant kingdom said the lady looking round well enclosed and how does your majesty govern it who is your minister una did not quite understand we play that she said play the lady threw up her hands and laughed we have it for our own together dan explained and never quarrel young burleigh sometimes but then we tell the lady nodded no brats of my own but i understand keeping a secret between queens and their ministers ay de mi but with no disrespect to present majesty methinks your realm small and therefore likely to be coveted by man and beast for is example she pointed to middenboro yonder old horse with the face of a spanish friar does he never break in he old hobden stops all our gaps for us said una and we let hobden catch rabbits in the shaw the lady laughed like a man i see hobden catches conies rabbits for himself and guards your defences for you does he make a profit out of his we never ask said una a particular friend of ours the lady began angrily then she laughed but i forget it is your kingdom i knew a maid once that had a larger one than this to defend and so long as her men kept the fences stopped she asked em no questions either was she trying to grow flowers said una no trees perdurable trees her flowers all withered the lady leaned her head on her hand they do if you look after them got a few would you like to see fetch you some una ran off to the rank grass in the shade behind the wigwam and came back with a handful of red flowers they pretty she said virginia stock virginia said the lady and lifted them to the fringe of her mask yes they come from virginia did your maid ever plant any not herself but her men adventured all over the earth to pluck or to plant flowers for her crown they judged her worthy of them and was she said dan cheerfully quien sabe who knows but at least while her men toiled abroad she toiled in england that they might find a safe home to come back to and what was she called gloriana belphoebe elizabeth of england her voice changed at each word you mean queen bess the lady bowed her head a little towards dan you name her lightly enough young burleigh what might you know of her said she well i seen the little green shoes she left at brickwall house down the road you know in a glass case awfully tiny things oh burleigh burleigh she laughed you are a courtier too soon a trap is sprung long before prince von der tann reached lustadt he had come to the conclusion that leopold was in virtue a prisoner in blentz to prove his conclusion he directed one of his staff to return to blentz and attempt to have audience with the king risk anything he instructed the officer to whom he had entrusted the mission submit if necessary to the humiliation of seeking an austrian pass through the lines to the castle see the king at any cost and deliver this message to him and to him alone and secretly tell him my fears and that if i do not have word from him within hours i shall assume that he is indeed a prisoner i shall then direct the mobilization of the army and take such steps as seem fit to rescue him and drive the invaders from the soil of lutha if you do not return i shall understand that you are held prisoner by the austrians and that my worst fears have been realized but prince ludwig was one who believed in being forehanded and so it happened that the orders for the mobilization of the army of lutha were issued within fifteen minutes of his return to lustadt it would do no harm thought the old man with a grim smile to get things well under way a day ahead of time this accomplished he summoned the serbian minister with what purpose and to what effect became historically evident several days later when after hours absence his aide had not returned from blentz the chancellor had no regrets for his forehandedness in the castle of peter of blentz the king of lutha was being entertained royally he was told nothing of the attempt of his chancellor to see him nor did he know that a messenger from prince von der tann was being held a prisoner in the camp of the austrians in the village he was surrounded by the creatures of prince peter and by peter's staunch allies the austrian minister and the austrian officers attached to the expeditionary force occupying the town they told him that they had positive information that the serbians already had crossed the frontier into lutha and that the presence of the austrian troops was purely for the protection of lutha it was not until the morning following the rebuff of prince von der tann that peter of blentz count zellerndorf and maenck heard of the occurrence they were chagrined by the accident for they were not ready to deliver their final stroke the young officer of the guard had of course but followed his instructions who would have thought that old von der tann would come to blentz that he suspected their motives seemed apparent and now that his rebuff at the gates had aroused his ire and doubtless crystallized his suspicions they might find in him a very ugly obstacle to the fruition of their plans with von der tann actively opposed to them the value of having the king upon their side would be greatly minimized the people and the army had every confidence in the old chancellor even if he opposed the king there was reason to believe that they might still side with him what is to be done asked zellerndorf is there no way either to win or force von der tann to acquiescence i think we can accomplish it said prince peter after a moment of thought let us see leopold his mind has been prepared to receive almost gratefully any insinuations against the loyalty of von der tann with proper evidence the king may easily be persuaded to order the chancellor's arrest possibly his execution as well so they saw the king only to meet a stubborn refusal upon the part of leopold to accede to their suggestions he still was madly in love with von der tann's daughter and he knew that a blow delivered at her father would only tend to increase her bitterness toward him the conspirators were nonplussed they had looked for a comparatively easy road to the consummation of their desires what in the world could be the cause of the king's stubborn desire to protect the man they knew he feared hated and mistrusted with all the energy of his suspicious nature it was the king himself who answered their unspoken question i cannot believe in the disloyalty of prince ludwig he said nor could i even if i desired it take such drastic steps as you suggest some day the princess emma his daughter will be my queen count zellerndorf was the first to grasp the possibilities that lay in the suggestion the king's words carried your majesty he cried there is a way to unite all factions in lutha it would be better to insure the loyalty of von der tann through bonds of kinship than to antagonize him marry the princess emma at once wait your majesty he added as leopold raised an objecting hand i am well informed as to the strange obstinacy of the princess but for the welfare of the state yes for the sake of your very throne sire you should exert your royal prerogatives and command the princess emma to carry out the

my little jim used to say when cooking something at home that he likes when the or measles breaks out amongst the children or the teacher or his wife falls dangerously ill or dies it matter which and there no school when a boy is naked and in his natural state for a warm climate like australia with three or four of his schoolmates under the shade of the in the bend where a good clear pool with a sandy bottom when his father buys him a gun and he starts out after kangaroos or possums when he gets a horse saddle and bridle of his own when he has his arm in splints or a stitch in his head proud then the proudest boy in the district i a average boy i reckon i was born for a poet by mistake and grew up to be a bushman and know what was the matter with me or the world but got nothing to do with it there are times when a man is happy when he finds out that the girl loves him when just married when a lawful father for the first time and everything is going on all right some men make fools of themselves then i know i did happy because out of debt and can see clear ahead and because i been easy for a long time but i think that the happiest time in a life is when courting a girl and finds out for sure that she loves him and a thought for any one else make the most of your courting days you young chaps and keep them clean for about the only days when a chance of poetry and beauty coming into this life make the best of them and never regret it the longest day you live the days that the wife will look back to anyway in the brightest of times as well as in the blackest and there be anything in those days that might hurt her when she looks back make the most of your courting days you young chaps for they will never come again a married man knows all about it after a while he sees the woman world through the eyes of his wife he knows what an extra pressure of the hand means and if he has had a hard life and is inclined to be cynical the knowledge does him no good it leads him into awful messes sometimes for a married man if inclined that way has three times the chance with a woman that a single man has because the married man knows he is privileged he can guess pretty closely what a woman means when she says something else he knows just how far he can go he can go farther in five minutes towards coming to the point with a woman than an innocent young man dares go in three weeks above all the married man is more decided with women he takes them and things for granted in short he is well he is a married man and when he knows all this how much better or happier is he for it mark twain says that he lost all the beauty of the river when he saw it with a eye and there you have it the hungry man was fed young van bibber broke one of his rules of life one day and came this unusual journey into the marts of trade and finance was in response to a call from his lawyer who wanted his signature to some papers it was five years since van bibber had been south of the north side of washington square except as a transient traveller to the ferries on the elevated road and as he walked through the city hall square he looked about him at the new buildings in the air and the bustle and confusion of the streets with as much interest as a lately arrived immigrant he rather enjoyed the novelty of the situation and after he had completed his business at the lawyer's office he tried to stroll along lower broadway as he did on the avenue but people bumped against him and carts and drays tried to run him down when he crossed the side streets and those young men whom he knew seemed to be in a great hurry and expressed such amused surprise at seeing him that he felt very much out of place indeed and so he decided to get back to his club window and its quiet as soon as possible hello van bibber said one of the young men who were speeding by what brings you here have you lost your way i think i have said van bibber if you'll kindly tell me how i can get back to civilization again be obliged to you take the elevated from park place said his friend from over his shoulder as he nodded and dived into the crowd the visitor from had not a very distinct idea as to where park place was but he struck off broadway and followed the line of the elevated road along church street it was at the corner of vesey street that a dirty and object stood still in his tracks and begged van bibber for a few cents to buy food i've come all the way from chicago said the object and i haven't tasted food for hours van bibber drew away as though the object had a contagious disease in his rags and handed him a quarter without waiting to receive the man's blessing poor devil said van bibber fancy going without dinner all day he could not fancy this though he tried and the impossibility of it impressed him so much that he amiably determined to go back and hunt up the object and give him more money van bibber's ideas of a dinner were rather exalted he did not know of places where a quarter was good for a square meal including one roast three vegetables and pie he hardly considered a quarter a sufficiently large tip for the waiter who served the dinner and decidedly not enough for the dinner itself he did not see his man at first and when he did the man did not see him van bibber watched him stop three gentlemen two of whom gave him some money and then the object approached van bibber and repeated his sad tale in a monotone he evidently did not recognize van bibber and the clubman gave him a and walked away feeling that the man must surely have enough by this time with which to get something to eat if only a luncheon this retracing of his footsteps had confused van bibber and he made a complete circuit of the block before he discovered that he had lost his bearings he was standing just where he had started and gazing along the line of the elevated road looking for a station when the familiar accents of the object again saluted him when van bibber faced him the beggar looked uneasy he was not sure whether or not he had approached this particular gentleman before but van bibber conceived an idea of much subtlety and deceived the object by again putting his hand in his pocket nothing to eat for hours dear me drawled the clubman sympathetically haven't you any money either not a cent groaned the object an i'm just faint for food sir s help me i hate to beg sir it isn't the money i want it's jest food i'm starvin sir well said van bibber suddenly if it is just something to eat you want come in here with me and i'll give you your breakfast but the man held back and began to whine and complain that they wouldn't let the likes of him in such a fine place oh yes they will said van bibber glancing at the bill of fare in front of the place it seems to be extremely cheap beefsteak fifteen cents for instance go in he added and there was something in his tone which made the object move ungraciously into the it was a very queer place van bibber thought and the people stared very hard at him and his gloves and the gardenia in his coat and at the tramp accompanying him you ain't going to eat two breakfasts are yer asked one of the very waiters of the object the object looked uneasy and van bibber who stood beside his chair smiled in triumph chapter xxx events of wednesday the university of cramond i awoke to much diffidence even to a feeling that might be called the beginnings of panic and lay for hours in my bed considering the situation seek where i pleased there was nothing to encourage me and plenty to appal they kept a close watch about the cottage they had a beast of a at least unless i had settled it and if i had i knew its bereaved master would only watch the more indefatigably for the loss in the pardonable ostentation of love i had given all the money i could spare to flora i had thought it glorious that the hunted exile should come down like jupiter in a shower of gold and pour thousands in the lap of the beloved then i had in an hour of arrant folly buried what remained to me in a bank in george street and now i must get back the one or the other and which and how as i tossed in my bed i could see three possible courses all extremely perilous first rowley might have been mistaken the bank might not be watched it might still be possible for him to draw the money on the deposit receipt second i might apply again to robbie or third i might dare everything go to the assembly ball and speak with flora under the eyes of all edinburgh this last alternative involving as it did the most horrid risks and the delay of hours i did but glance at with an averted head and turned again to the consideration of the others it was the likeliest thing in the world that robbie had been warned to have no more to do with me the whole policy of the gilchrists was in the hands of chevenix and i thought this was a precaution so elementary that he was certain to have taken it if he had not of course i was all right robbie would manage to communicate with flora and by four i might be on the south road and i was going to say a free man lastly i must assure myself with my own eyes whether the bank in george street were beleaguered i called to rowley and questioned him tightly as to the appearance of the bow street officer what sort of looking man is he rowley i asked as i began to dress wot sort of a looking man he is repeated rowley well i very well know wot you would say mr anne he a beauty is he tall tall well no i say tall mr anne well then is he short short no i think i would say he was what you would call short no not piticular short sir then i suppose he must be about the middle height well you might say it sir but not remarkable so i smothered an oath is he i tried him again he repeated with the same air of anxious candour good heaven man repeat my words like a parrot i cried tell me what the man was like it is of the first importance that i should be able to recognise him trying to mr anne but i seem to rightly get hold of that sometimes it might appear to me like as if he was and sometimes like as if he no it surprise me now if you was to tell me he ad a bit o whisker was the man i roared dwelling on each syllable i think you need go for to get cross about it mr anne said he tellin you every blessed thing i see well no not as you would remark upon a dreadful calm fell upon me was he anywise pale i asked well it seem to me as though he were but i tell you truly i take much heed to that did he look like a drinking man well no if you please sir he looked more like an eating one oh he was stout was he no sir i go so far as that no he not to say stout if anything lean rather i need not go on with the infuriating interview it ended as it began except that rowley was in tears and that i had acquired one fact the man was drawn for me as being of any height you like to mention and of any degree of corpulence or leanness or not as the case might be the colour of his hair rowley could not take it upon himself to put a name on that of his eyes he thought to have been blue nay it was the one point on which he attained to a kind of tearful certainty take my davy on it he asseverated they proved to have been as black as sloes very little and very near together so much for the evidence of the artless and the fact or rather the facts acquired well they had to do not with the person but with his clothing the man wore and white stockings his coat was some kind of a lightish colour or betwixt that and dark and he wore a weskit as if this were not enough he presently haled me from my breakfast in a prodigious flutter and showed me an honest and rather venerable citizen passing in the square chapter x a charming introduction to a hermit's life four weeks torture tossing and sickness oh these bleak winds and bitter northern skies and impassable roads and dilatory country surgeons and oh this dearth of the human physiognomy and worse than all the terrible intimation of kenneth that i need not expect to be out of doors till spring mr heathcliff has just honoured me with a call about seven days ago he sent me a brace of grouse the last of the season scoundrel he is not altogether guiltless in this illness of mine and that i had a great mind to tell him but alas how could i offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts blisters and leeches this is quite an easy interval i am too weak to read yet i feel as if i could enjoy something interesting why not have up mrs dean to finish her tale i can recollect its chief incidents as far as she had gone yes i remember her hero had run off and never been heard of for three years and the heroine was married i'll ring she'll be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully mrs dean came it wants twenty minutes sir to taking the medicine she commenced away away with it i replied i desire to have the doctor says you must drop the powders with all my heart don't interrupt me come and take your seat here keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials draw your knitting out of your pocket that will do now continue the history of mr heathcliff from where you left off to the present day did he finish his education on the continent and come back a gentleman or did he get a sizar's place at college or escape to america and earn honours by drawing blood from his or make a fortune more promptly on the english highways he may have done a little in all these vocations mr lockwood but i couldn't give my word for any i stated before that i didn't know how he gained his money neither am i aware of the means he took to raise his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk but with your leave i'll proceed in my own fashion if you think it will amuse and not weary you are you feeling better this morning much that's good news i got miss catherine and myself to thrushcross grange and to my agreeable disappointment she behaved infinitely better than i dared to expect she seemed almost of mr linton and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection they were both very attentive to her comfort certainly it was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn there were no mutual concessions one stood erect and the others yielded and who can be and when they encounter neither opposition nor indifference i observed that mr edgar had a fear of ruffling her humour he concealed it from her but if ever he heard me answer sharply or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious order of hers he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account he many a time spoke sternly to me about my pertness and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed not to grieve a kind master i learned to be less touchy and for the space of half a year the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand because no fire came near to explode it catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then they were respected with sympathising silence by her husband who ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution produced by her perilous illness as she was never subject to depression of spirits before the return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from him i believe i may assert that they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness it ended well we must be for ourselves in the long run the mild and generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering and it ended when circumstances caused each to feel that the one's interest was not the chief consideration in the other's thoughts on a mellow evening in september i was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples which i had been gathering it had got dusk and the moon looked over the high wall of the court causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building i set my burden on the by the and lingered to rest and drew in a few more breaths of the soft sweet air my eyes were on the moon and my back to the entrance when i heard a voice behind me say is that you it was a deep voice and foreign in tone yet there was something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar i turned about to discover who spoke fearfully for the doors were shut and i had seen nobody on approaching the steps something stirred in the porch and moving nearer i distinguished a tall man dressed in dark clothes with dark face and hair he leant against the side and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself who can it be i thought mr earnshaw oh no the voice has no resemblance to his chapter xxxii the feast of belshazzar a seer to translate such feelings as were generated in carrie by this walk put her in an exceedingly receptive mood for the pathos which followed in the play the actor whom they had gone to see had achieved his popularity by presenting a mellow type of comedy in which sufficient sorrow was introduced to lend contrast and relief to humour for carrie as we well know the stage had a great attraction she had never forgotten her one histrionic achievement in chicago it dwelt in her mind and occupied her consciousness during many long afternoons in which her and her latest novel contributed the only pleasures of her state never could she witness a play without having her own ability vividly brought to consciousness some scenes made her long to be a part of them to give expression to the feelings which she in the place of the character represented would feel almost invariably she would carry the vivid imaginations away with her and brood over them the next day alone she lived as much in these things as in the realities which made up her daily life it was not often that she came to the play stirred to her core by actualities a low song of longing had been set singing in her heart by the finery the merriment the beauty she had seen oh these women who had passed her by hundreds and hundreds strong who were they whence came the rich elegant dresses the astonishingly coloured buttons the of silver and gold where were these lovely creatures housed amid what elegancies of carved furniture decorated walls elaborate tapestries did they move where were their rich apartments loaded with all that money could provide in what stables champed these sleek nervous horses and rested the gorgeous carriages where lounged the richly groomed footmen oh the mansions the lights the perfume the loaded boudoirs and tables new york must be filled with such bowers or the beautiful insolent supercilious creatures could not be some hothouses held them it ached her to know that she was not one of them that alas she had dreamed a dream and it had not come true she wondered at her own solitude these two years past her indifference to the fact that she had never achieved what she had expected the play was one of those concoctions in which charmingly overdressed ladies and gentlemen suffer the pangs of love and jealousy amid gilded surroundings such are ever enticing to those who have all their days longed for such material surroundings and have never had them gratified they have the charm of showing suffering under ideal conditions who would not grieve upon a gilded chair who would not suffer amid perfumed tapestries cushioned furniture and liveried servants grief under such circumstances becomes an enticing thing carrie longed to be of it she wanted to take her sufferings whatever they were in such a world or failing that at least to simulate them under such charming conditions upon the stage so affected was her mind by what she had seen that the play now seemed an extraordinarily beautiful thing she was soon lost in the world it represented and wished that she might never return between the acts she studied the galaxy of matinée attendants in front rows and boxes and conceived a new idea of the possibilities of new york she was sure she had not seen it all that the city was one whirl of pleasure and delight going out the same broadway taught her a sharper lesson the scene she had witnessed coming down was now augmented and at its height such a crush of finery and folly she had never seen it clinched her convictions concerning her state she had not lived could not lay claim to having lived until something of this had come into her own life women were spending money like water she could see that in every elegant shop she passed flowers candy jewelry seemed the principal things in which the elegant dames were interested and she she had scarcely enough pin money to indulge in such outings as this a few times a month that night the pretty little flat seemed a commonplace thing it was not what the rest of the world was enjoying she saw the servant working at dinner with an indifferent eye in her mind were running scenes of the play particularly she remembered one beautiful actress the sweetheart who had been wooed and won the grace of this woman had won heart her dresses had been all that art could suggest her sufferings had been so real the anguish which she had portrayed carrie could feel it was done as she was sure she could do it there were places in which she could even do better hence she repeated the lines to herself oh if she could only have such a part how broad would be her life she too could act appealingly when hurstwood came carrie was moody she was sitting rocking and thinking and did not care to have her enticing imaginations broken in upon so she said little or nothing the matter carrie said hurstwood after a time noticing her quiet almost moody state vii during the ensuing weeks mr ramy though his visits were as frequent as ever did not seem to regain his usual spirits he complained frequently of headache but rejected ann eliza's tentatively proffered remedies and seemed to shrink from any prolonged investigation of his symptoms july had come with a sudden ardour of heat and one evening as the three sat together by the open window in the back room evelina said i dunno what i wouldn't give a night like this for a breath of real country air so would i said mr ramy knocking the ashes from his pipe i'd like to be setting in an arbour dis very minute oh wouldn't it be lovely i always think it's real cool here we'd be heaps hotter up where miss mellins is said ann eliza oh i daresay but we'd be heaps cooler somewhere else her sister snapped she was not infrequently exasperated by ann eliza's furtive attempts to mollify providence a few days later mr ramy appeared with a suggestion which enchanted evelina he had gone the day before to see his friend mrs hochmuller who lived in the outskirts of hoboken and mrs hochmuller had proposed that on the following sunday he should bring the bunner sisters to spend the day with her she's got a real garden you know mr ramy explained wid trees and a real to set in and hens and chickens too and it's an elegant sail over on de the proposal drew no response from ann eliza she was still oppressed by the recollection of her interminable sunday in the park but obedient to evelina's imperious glance she finally faltered out an acceptance the sunday was a very hot one and once on the ann eliza revived at the touch of the salt breeze and the spectacle of the crowded waters but when they reached the other shore and stepped out on the dirty wharf she began to ache with anticipated weariness they got into a and were jolted from one mean street to another till at length mr ramy pulled the conductor's sleeve and they got out again then they stood in the blazing sun near the door of a crowded waiting for another car to come and that carried them out to a thinly settled district past vacant lots and narrow brick houses standing in unsupported solitude till they finally reached an almost rural region of scattered cottages and low wooden buildings that looked like village stores here the car finally stopped of its own accord and they walked along a rutty road past a yard with a high fence tapestried with theatrical advertisements to a little red house with green blinds and a garden paling really mr ramy had not deceived them clumps of dielytra and bloomed behind the paling and a crooked elm hung romantically over the gable of the house at the gate mrs hochmuller a broad woman in merino met them with nods and smiles while her daughter linda a girl with mottled red cheeks and a sidelong stare hovered inquisitively behind her mrs hochmuller leading the way into the house conducted the bunner sisters the way to her bedroom here they were invited to spread out on a mountainous white featherbed the cashmere mantles under which the solemnity of the occasion had compelled them to swelter and when they had given their black silks the necessary twitch of readjustment and evelina had fluffed out her hair before a framed in work their hostess led them to a stuffy parlour smelling of gingerbread after another ceremonial pause broken by polite enquiries and shy ejaculations they were shown into the kitchen where the table was already spread with and stewed fruits and where they presently found themselves seated between mrs hochmuller and mr ramy while the staring linda bumped back and forth from the stove with steaming dishes to ann eliza the dinner seemed endless and the rich fare strangely unappetizing she was abashed by the easy intimacy of her hostess's voice and eye with mr ramy mrs hochmuller was almost flippantly familiar and it was only when ann eliza pictured her generous form bent above his that she could forgive her for tersely addressing him as ramy during one of the pauses of the meal mrs hochmuller laid her knife and fork against the edges of her plate and fixing her eyes on the face said accusingly you hat one of dem turns again ramy i dunno as i had he returned evasively evelina glanced from one to the other mr ramy has been sick she said at length as though to show that she also was in a position to speak with authority he's complained very frequently of headaches ho i know him said mrs hochmuller with a laugh her eyes still on the ain't you ashamed of yourself ramy mr ramy who was looking at his plate said suddenly one word which the sisters could not understand it sounded to ann eliza like shwike mrs hochmuller laughed again my my she said wouldn't you think he'd be ashamed to go and be sick and never dell me me that nursed him troo dat awful fever chapter i was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners he looked upon me however with some degree of severity and then turning towards my conductors he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion about half a dozen men came forward and one being selected by the magistrate he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and daniel nugent when about ten they observed a strong northerly blast rising and they accordingly put in for port it was a very dark night as the moon had not yet risen they did not land at the harbour but as they had been accustomed at a creek about two miles below he walked on first carrying a part of the fishing tackle and his companions followed him at some distance as he was proceeding along the sands he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground his companions came up to assist him and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man who was to all appearance dead their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold they instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured but in vain to restore it to life it appeared to be a handsome young man about five and twenty years of age he had apparently been strangled for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck the first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned i remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated my limbs trembled and a mist came over my eyes which obliged me to lean on a chair for support the magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner the son confirmed his account but when daniel nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion he saw a boat with a single man in it at a short distance from the shore and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars it was the same boat in which i had just landed a woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage waiting for the return of the fishermen about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house it was not cold they put it into a bed and rubbed it and daniel went to the town for an apothecary but life was quite gone several other men were examined concerning my landing and they agreed that with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night it was very probable that i had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which i had departed besides they observed that it appeared that i had brought the body from another place and it was likely that as i did not appear to know the shore i might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of from the place where i had deposited the corpse mr kirwin on hearing this evidence desired that i should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me this idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation i had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described i was accordingly conducted by the magistrate and several other persons to the inn i could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night but knowing that i had been conversing with several persons in the island i had inhabited about the time that the body had been found i was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair i entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin how can i describe my sensations on beholding it i feel yet parched with horror nor can i reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony the examination the presence of the magistrate and witnesses passed like a dream from my memory when i saw the lifeless form of henry clerval stretched before me i gasped for breath and throwing myself on the body i exclaimed have my murderous machinations deprived you also my dearest henry of life two i have already destroyed other victims await their destiny but you clerval my friend my benefactor the telescope of the rocky mountains on the of october in the preceding year after the close of the subscription the president of the gun club had credited the observatory of cambridge with the necessary sums for the construction of a gigantic optical instrument this instrument was designed for the purpose of rendering visible on the surface of the moon any object exceeding nine feet in diameter at the period when the gun club essayed their great experiment such instruments had reached a high degree of perfection and produced some magnificent results two telescopes in particular at this time were possessed of remarkable power and of gigantic dimensions the first constructed by herschel was feet in length and had an of four feet six inches it possessed a magnifying power of the second was raised in ireland in parsonstown park and belongs to lord rosse the length of this tube is feet and the diameter of its six feet it magnifies times and required an immense erection of brick work and masonry for the purpose of working it its weight being twelve and a half tons still despite these colossal dimensions the actual enlargements scarcely exceeded times in round numbers consequently the moon was brought within no nearer an apparent distance than miles and objects of less than sixty feet in diameter unless they were of very considerable length were still imperceptible in the present case dealing with a projectile nine feet in diameter and fifteen feet long it became necessary to bring the moon within an apparent distance of five miles at most and for that purpose to establish a magnifying power of times such was the question proposed to the observatory of cambridge there was no lack of funds the difficulty was purely one of construction after considerable discussion as to the best form and principle of the proposed instrument the work was finally commenced according to the calculations of the observatory of cambridge the tube of the new reflector would require to be feet in length and the sixteen feet in diameter colossal as these dimensions may appear they were diminutive in comparison with the foot telescope proposed by the astronomer hooke only a few years ago regarding the choice of locality that matter was promptly determined the object was to select some lofty mountain and there are not many of these in the united states in fact there are but two chains of moderate elevation between which runs the magnificent mississippi the king of rivers as these republican yankees delight to call it eastwards rise the appalachians the very highest point of which in new hampshire does not exceed the very moderate altitude of feet on the west however rise the rocky mountains that immense range which commencing at the straights of magellan follows the western coast of southern america under the name of the andes or the cordilleras until it crosses the isthmus of panama and runs up the whole of north america to the very borders of the polar sea the highest elevation of this range still does not exceed feet with this elevation nevertheless the gun club were compelled to be content inasmuch as they had determined that both telescope and columbiad should be erected within the limits of the union all the necessary apparatus was consequently sent on to the summit of long's peak in the territory of missouri neither pen nor language can describe the difficulties of all kinds which the american engineers had to surmount of the prodigies of daring and skill which they accomplished they had to raise enormous stones massive pieces of wrought iron heavy and huge portions of cylinder with an weighing nearly pounds above the line of perpetual snow for more than feet in height after crossing desert prairies impenetrable forests fearful rapids far from all centers of population and in the midst of savage regions in which every detail of life becomes an almost insoluble problem and yet notwithstanding these innumerable obstacles american genius triumphed in less than a year after the commencement of the works toward the close of september the gigantic reflector rose into the air to a height of feet it was raised by means of an enormous iron crane an ingenious mechanism allowed it to be easily worked toward all the points of the heavens and to follow the stars from the one horizon to the other during their journey through the heavens it had cost the first time it was directed toward the moon the observers evinced both curiosity and anxiety what were they about to discover in the field of this telescope which magnified objects times would they perceive peoples herds of lunar animals towns lakes seas no there was nothing which science had not already discovered and on all the points of its disc the volcanic nature of the moon became determinable with the utmost precision but the telescope of the rocky mountains before doing its duty to the gun club rendered immense services to astronomy thanks to its penetrative power the depths of the heavens were sounded to the utmost extent the apparent diameter of a great number of stars was accurately measured and mr clark of the cambridge staff

palais royal formerly styled the palais cardinal a man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flames great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin candelabra rich with any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of the and the measured paces of the guards upon the have fancied that the shade of cardinal richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt it was alas the ghost of former greatness france enfeebled the authority of her sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great richelieu no longer in existence in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal that the people were possessed of arms the pawnbroker's shop stuffed behind the counter and on the shelves of the pawnbroker's shop were articles in almost endless variety all was fish that came to his net he was willing to advance on anything that had a marketable value and which promised to yield him i was about to say a fair profit but a fair profit was far from satisfying the old man he demanded an extortionate profit from those whom drove to his door for relief eliakim henderson for that was his name was a small man with a bald head scattering yellow whiskers and foxlike eyes spiderlike he waited for the flies who flew of their own accord into his clutches and took care not to let them go until he had levied a large tribute when paul entered the shop there were three customers ahead of him one was a young woman whose pale face and sunken cheeks showed that she was waging an unequal conflict with disease she was a seamstress by occupation and had to work fifteen hours a day to earn the little that was barely sufficient to keep body and soul together confined in her close little room on the fourth floor she scarcely dared to snatch time to look out of the window into the street beneath lest she should not be able to complete her allotted task a two days sickness had compelled her to have recourse to eliakim henderson she had under her arm a small bundle covered with an old copy of the sun what have you got there asked the old man roughly show it quick for there's others waiting meekly she unfolded a small shawl somewhat faded from long use what will you give me on that she asked timidly it isn't worth much it cost five dollars then you got cheated it never was worth half the money what do you want on it the seamstress intended to ask a dollar and a half but after this depreciation she did not venture to name so high a figure a dollar and a quarter she said a dollar and a quarter repeated the old man shrilly take it home with you i don't want it what will you give asked the poor girl faintly fifty cents not a penny more fifty cents she repeated in dismay and was about to refold it but the thought of her rent in arrears changed her intention i'll take it sir the money and ticket were handed her and she went back to her miserable coughing as she went now ma'am said eliakim his new customer was an irish woman by no means consumptive in appearance red of face and portly of figure and what'll ye be givin me for this she asked displaying a pair of pantaloons are they yours ma'am asked eliakim with a chuckle it's not bridget mccarty that wears the breeches said that lady it's me husband's and a dacent respectable man he is barrin the drink which turns his head what'll ye give for em name your price said eliakim whose principle it was to insist upon his customers making the first offer twelve shillin's said bridget twelve shillings exclaimed eliakim holding up both hands that's all they cost when they were new they cost every cint of five dollars said bridget they was made at one of the most fashionable shops in the city oh they was an illigant pair when they was new how many years ago was that asked the pawnbroker only six months and they ain't been worn more'n a month i'll give you fifty cents fifty cints repeated mrs mccarty turning to the other customers as if to call their attention to an offer so out of proportion to the valuable article she held in her hand only fifty cints for these illigant breeches oh it's you that's a hard man that lives on the poor and the nady you needn't take it i should lose money on it if you didn't redeem it he says he'd lose money on it said mrs mccarty and suppose he did isn't he in gold i'm poor said eliakim almost as poor as you because i'm too liberal to my customers hear till him said mrs mccarty he says he's liberal and only offers fifty cints for these illigant breeches will you take them or leave them demanded the pawnbroker impatiently you may give me the money said bridget and it's i that wonder how you can slape in your bed when you are so hard on poor folks mrs mccarty departed with her money and eliakim fixed his sharp eyes on the next customer it was a tall man shabbily dressed with a thin face and the expression of one who had struggled with the world and failed in the struggle how much for this he asked pointing to the violin and speaking in a slow deliberate tone as if he did not feel at home in the language what do you want for it ten dollar he answered ten dollars you're crazy was the contemptuous comment of the pawnbroker he is a very good violin said the man if you would like to hear him and he made a movement as if to play upon it chapter xii the rev mr ware found levi gorringe's readily enough but its owner was not in he probably would be back again though in a quarter of an hour or so the boy said and the minister at once decided to wait theron was interested in finding that this was no other than harvey the lad who brought milk to the parsonage every morning he remembered now that he had heard good things of this urchin as to the hard work he did to help his mother the widow semple in her struggle to keep a roof over her head and also bad things in that he did not come regularly either to church or the clergyman recalled too that harvey had impressed him as a character well sonny are you going to be a lawyer he asked as he seated himself by the window and looked about him first at the dusty litter of old papers pamphlets and documents in bundles which crowded the stuffy chamber and then at the boy himself harvey was busy at a big box a rough pine box which bore the flaring label of an express company and also of a seed firm in a western city and which the boy had apparently just opened he was lifting from it and placing on the table after he had shaken off the sawdust and moss in which they were packed small parcels of what looked in the fading light to be plants well i don't know i rather guess not he made answer as he pursued his task so far as i can make out this wouldn't be the place to start in at if i was going to be a lawyer a boy can learn here how to load cartridges and clean a gun and braid on to leaders but i don't see much law laying around loose anyway he went on i couldn't afford to read law and not be getting any wages i have to earn money you know theron felt that he liked the boy yes he said with a kindly tone i've heard that you are a good industrious youngster i daresay mr gorringe will see to it that you get a chance to read law and get wages too oh i can read all there is here and welcome the boy explained stepping toward the window to decipher the label on a bundle of roots in his hand but that's no good unless there's regular practice coming into the office all the while that's how you learn to be a lawyer but gorringe don't have what i call a practice at all he just sees men in the other room there with the door shut and whatever there is to do he does it all himself the minister remembered a stray hint somewhere that mr gorringe was a what was colloquially called a to his rustic sense there was something not quite nice about that occupation it would be indecorous he felt to encourage further talk about it from the boy what are you doing there he inquired to change the subject sorting out some plants replied harvey i don't know what's got into gorringe lately this is the third big box he's had since i've been here that is in six weeks besides two baskets full of i don't know what he does with them he carries them off himself somewhere i've had kind of half a notion that he's figurin on getting married i can't think of anything else that would make a man spend money like water just for flowers and bushes they do get foolish you know when they've got marriage on the brain theron found himself only imperfectly following the theories of the young philosopher it was his fact that monopolized the minister's attention but as i understand it he remarked hesitatingly brother gorringe or rather mr gorringe gets all the plants he wants everything he likes from a big garden somewhere outside i don't know that it is exactly his but i remember hearing something to that effect the boy slapped the last litter off his hands and as he came to the window shook his head these don't come from no garden outside he declared they come from the dealers and he pays solid cash for em the invoice for this lot alone was dollars and sixty cents there it is on the table you can see it for yourself mr ware did not offer to look very likely these are for the garden i was speaking of he said of course you can't go on taking plants out of a garden indefinitely without putting others in i don't know anything about any garden that he takes plants out of answered harvey and looked meditatively for a minute or two out upon the street below then he turned to the minister your wife's doing a good deal of gardening this spring i notice he said casually you'd hardly think it was the same place she's fixed it up so if she wants any extra hoeing done i can always get off saturday afternoons i will remember said theron he also looked out of the window and nothing more was said until a few moments later mr gorringe himself came in chapter i the last word of two great coquettes after the disasters of the revolution of july which destroyed so many aristocratic fortunes dependent on the court madame la princesse de cadignan was clever enough to attribute to political events the total ruin she had caused by her own extravagance the prince left france with the royal family and never returned to it leaving the princess in paris protected by the fact of his absence for their debts which the sale of all their salable property had not been able to extinguish could only be recovered through him the revenues of the entailed estates had been seized in short the affairs of this great family were in as bad a state as those of the elder branch of the bourbons this woman so celebrated under her first name of duchesse de maufrigneuse very wisely decided to live in retirement and to make herself if possible forgotten paris was then so carried away by the whirling current of events that the duchesse de maufrigneuse buried in the princesse de cadignan a change of name unknown to most of the new actors brought upon the stage of society by the revolution of july did really become a stranger in her own city in paris the title of duke ranks all others even that of prince though in heraldic theory free of all sophism titles signify nothing there is absolute equality among gentlemen this fine equality was formerly maintained by the house of france itself and in our day it is so still at least nominally witness the care with which the kings of france give to their sons the simple title of count it was in virtue of this system that francois i crushed the splendid titles assumed by the pompous charles the fifth by signing his answer francois seigneur de vanves louis xi did better still by marrying his daughter to an untitled gentleman pierre de beaujeu the feudal system was so thoroughly broken up by louis xiv that the title of duke became during his reign the supreme honor of the aristocracy and the most coveted nevertheless there are two or three families in france in which the principality richly endowed in former times takes precedence of the duchy the house of cadignan which possesses the title of duc de maufrigneuse for its eldest sons is one of these exceptional families like the princes of the house of rohan in earlier days the princes of cadignan had the right to a throne in their own domain they could have pages and gentlemen in their service this explanation is necessary as much to escape foolish critics who know nothing as to record the customs of a world which we are told is about to disappear and which evidently so many persons are assisting to push away without knowing what it is the cadignans bear or five lozenges sable appointed placed with the word memini for motto a crown with a cap of maintenance no supporters or mantle in these days the great crowd of strangers flocking to paris and the almost universal ignorance of the science of heraldry are beginning to bring the title of prince into fashion there are no real princes but those possessed of principalities to whom belongs the title of highness the disdain shown by the french nobility for the title of prince and the reasons which caused louis xiv to give supremacy to the title of duke have prevented frenchmen from claiming the appellation of highness for the few princes who exist in france those of napoleon excepted this is why the princes of cadignan hold an inferior position nominally to the princes of the continent the members of the society called the faubourg protected the princess by a respectful silence due to her name which is one of those that all men honor to her misfortunes which they ceased to discuss and to her beauty the only thing she saved of her departed opulence society of which she had once been the ornament was thankful to her for having as it were taken the veil and cloistered herself in her own home this act of good taste was for her more than for any other woman an immense sacrifice great deeds are always so keenly felt in france that the princess gained by her retreat as much as she had lost in public opinion in the days of her splendor she now saw only one of her old friends the marquise and even to her she never went on festive occasions or to parties the princess and the marquise visited each other in the forenoons with a certain amount of secrecy when the princess went to dine with her friend the marquise closed her doors madame treated the princess charmingly she changed her box at the opera leaving the first tier for a baignoire on the so that madame de cadignan could come to the theatre unseen and depart incognito few women would have been capable of a delicacy which deprived them of the pleasure of bearing in their train a fallen rival and of publicly being her benefactress thus relieved of the necessity for costly toilets the princess could enjoy the theatre whither she went in madame carriage which she would never have accepted openly in the daytime no one has ever known madame reasons for behaving thus to the princesse de cadignan but her conduct was admirable and for a long time included a number of little acts which viewed single seem mere trifles but taken in the mass become gigantic chapter xviii in the devil's luck riding confidently on the trail of the three horsemen who had taken to the south along the front of the square butte believed that the turn of the trail around the southern end meant simply that the three who came this way would meet their companions on the other side and that he following after would be certain to meet applehead he had hopes of the speedy capture of ramon chavez and his men and the hope spread to the four who went with him so that their spirits rose considerably big medicine and happy jack even found a good deal of amusement in their exchange of opinions regarding old granny applehead and his constant fear of the navvies now and then the native son joined in the laugh though his attention was chiefly given to the discussion andy and luck were having about ramon and his manner of using luck's work as an opportunity to rob the bank and the probable effect it would have on the general standing of luck and his company unless they managed to land the thieves in jail being half mexican himself the native son was sensitive upon the subject of ramon and almost as anxious to see ramon in jail as was luck himself so while applehead and his boys were scenting danger and then finding themselves in the middle of it luck and his party rode along absorbed in themselves and in the ultimate goal which was ramon they saw nothing queer about the trail they followed and they saw no evidence of treachery anywhere they rode with the rifles slung under their right thighs and their at their hips and their eyes roving casually over their immediate surroundings while their minds roved elsewhere not because they were growing careless but because there was absolutely nothing to rouse their suspicions now that they no longer bad applehead along to preach danger and keep them keyed up to expect it they followed the tracks through a scattered grove of stunted pinons circled at fault for a few minutes in the rocks beyond and then picked up the trail they were then in the narrow neck which was called the handle of the devil's and they would have ridden unsuspectingly into the very pan itself had not the native son's quick eyes caught a movement on the across the bare basin he spoke to luck about it and luck levelled his field glasses and glimpsed a skulking form up there hunt yourselves some shelter boys he cried in the sharp tone of warning we'll make sure who's ahead before we go any farther they ducked behind rocks or trees and piled off their horses in a burry and a scattered fusillade from the ahead of them proved how urgent was their need for the first fifteen minutes or so they thought that they were fighting ramon and his party and their keenest emotions were built largely of resentment which showed in the booming voice of big medicine when he said grimly well i'd jest about as soon pack ramon in dead as lead im in alive n kickin by cripes which is him d'yuh reckon from behind a rock shield luck was studying the ledge they're injuns or there are injuns in the bunch at least he told them after a moment see that sharp point sticking up straight ahead i saw an injun peeking around the edge to the south you watch for him andy and let him have it where he lives next time be sticks his head out he swung the glasses slowly taking every inch of the rim in his field of vision as he moved them be named the man he wanted to watch each place where he had reason to suspect that someone was hiding the disheartening part of it was that he needed about a dozen more men than he had for the rock wall which was the rim of the seemed alive with shooters who waited only for a fair target then the native son crouched down between a rock and a clump of brush turned his head to see what his horse was looking at back whence they had come look behind you luck he advised with more calmness than one would expect of a man in his straits they're back in the pines too fight em off and take care that your backs don't show to those babies on the he ordered instantly thrusting his glasses into their case and snatching his rifle from its boot on the saddle they won't tackle coming across that bare hollow even if they can get down into it without breaking their necks happy lead your horse in here between these rocks where mine is bud see if you can get the over there outa sight among those bushes and rocks we'll hold em off while you fix the horses can't let ourselves be set afoot out here not andy green punctuated the sentence with a shot or two say i wish they'd quit sneaking around in those trees that way so a fellow could see where to shoot a half hour dragged by from the came occasional shots to which the besieged could not afford to reply they were so fully occupied with holding back those who skulked among the trees the horses fancying perhaps that this was a scene dozed behind their shelters and switched apathetically at buzzing flies and whining bullets alike their masters crouched behind their bowlders and watched catlike for some open demonstration and fired when they had the slightest reason to believe that they would hit something besides scenery i the nellie a cruising yawl swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails and was at rest the flood had made the wind was nearly calm and being bound down the river the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide the of the thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway in the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked with gleams of varnished sprits a haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness the air was dark above gravesend and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom brooding motionless over the biggest and the greatest town on earth the director of companies was our captain and our host we four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward on the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical he resembled a pilot which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified it was difficult to realize his work was not out there in the luminous estuary but behind him within the brooding gloom between us there was as i have already said somewhere the bond of the sea besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's yarns and even convictions the lawyer the best of old fellows had because of his many years and many virtues the only cushion on deck and was lying on the only rug the accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes and was toying architecturally with the bones marlow sat right aft leaning against the he had sunken cheeks a yellow complexion a straight back an ascetic aspect and with his arms dropped the palms of hands outwards resembled an idol the director satisfied the anchor had good hold made his way aft and sat down amongst us we exchanged a few words lazily afterwards there was silence on board the yacht for some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes we felt meditative and fit for nothing but placid staring the day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance the water shone pacifically the sky without a speck was a benign immensity of unstained light the very mist on the essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric hung from the wooded rises inland and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds only the gloom to the west brooding over the upper reaches became more somber every minute as if angered by the approach of the sun and at last in its curved and imperceptible fall the sun sank low and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat as if about to go out suddenly stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men forthwith a change came over the waters and the serenity became less brilliant but more profound the old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline of day after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth we looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever but in the august light of abiding memories and indeed nothing is easier for a man who has as the phrase goes followed the sea with reverence and affection than to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the thames the tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea it had known and served all the men of whom the nation is proud from sir francis drake to sir john franklin knights all titled and untitled the great of the sea it had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time from the golden hind returning with her round flanks full of treasure to be visited by the queen's highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale to the erebus and terror bound on other conquests and that never returned it had known the ships and the men they had sailed from deptford from greenwich from erith the adventurers and the settlers kings ships and the ships of men on change captains admirals the dark interlopers of the eastern trade and the commissioned generals of east india fleets hunters for gold or pursuers of fame they all had gone out on that stream bearing the sword and often the torch messengers of the might within the land bearers of a spark from the sacred fire what greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth the dreams of men the seed of commonwealths the germs of empires chapter xxxv edmund had determined that it belonged entirely to fanny to chuse whether her situation with regard to crawford should be mentioned between them or not and that if she did not lead the way it should never be touched on by him but after a day or two of mutual reserve he was induced by his father to change his mind and try what his influence might do for his friend a day and a very early day was actually fixed for the crawfords departure and sir thomas thought it might be as well to make one more effort for the young man before he left mansfield that all his professions and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much hope to sustain them as possible sir thomas was most cordially anxious for the perfection of mr crawford's character in that point he wished him to be a model of constancy and fancied the best means of effecting it would be by not trying him too long edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business he wanted to know fanny's feelings she had been used to consult him in every difficulty and he loved her too well to bear to be denied her confidence now he hoped to be of service to her he thought he must be of service to her whom else had she to open her heart to if she did not need counsel she must need the comfort of communication fanny estranged from him silent and reserved was an unnatural state of things a state which he must break through and which he could easily learn to think she was wanting him to break through i will speak to her sir i will take the first opportunity of speaking to her alone was the result of such thoughts as these and upon sir thomas's information of her being at that very time walking alone in the shrubbery he instantly joined her i am come to walk with you fanny said he shall i drawing her arm within his it is a long while since we have had a comfortable walk together she assented to it all rather by look than word her spirits were low but fanny he presently added in order to have a comfortable walk something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together you must talk to me i know you have something on your mind i know what you are thinking of you cannot suppose me uninformed am i to hear of it from everybody but fanny herself fanny at once agitated and dejected replied if you hear of it from everybody cousin there can be nothing for me to tell not of facts perhaps but of feelings fanny no one but you can tell me them i do not mean to press you however if it is not what you wish yourself i have done i had thought it might be a relief i am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in talking of what i feel do you suppose that we think differently i have no idea of it i dare say that on a comparison of our opinions they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be to the point i consider crawford's proposals as most advantageous and desirable if you could return his affection i consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it but that as you cannot you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him can there be any disagreement between us here oh no but i thought you blamed me i thought you were against me this is such a comfort this comfort you might have had sooner fanny had you sought it but how could you possibly suppose me against you how could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love were i even careless in general on such matters how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake my uncle thought me wrong and i knew he had been talking to you as far as you have gone fanny i think you perfectly right i may be sorry i may be surprised though hardly that for you had not had time to attach yourself but i think you perfectly right can it admit of a question it is disgraceful to us if it does you did not love him nothing could have justified your accepting him fanny had not felt so comfortable for days and days so far your conduct has been faultless and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise but the matter does not end here crawford's is no common attachment he perseveres with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before this we know must be a work of time but with an affectionate smile let him succeed at last fanny let him succeed at last you have proved yourself upright and disinterested prove yourself grateful and and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which i have always believed you born for oh never never never he never will succeed with me and she spoke with a warmth which quite astonished edmund and which she blushed at the recollection of herself when she saw his look and heard him reply never fanny so very determined and positive this is not like yourself your rational self the arabian tunnel that same evening in n lat the nautilus floated on the surface of the sea approaching the arabian coast i saw djeddah the most important of egypt syria turkey and india i distinguished clearly enough its buildings the vessels anchored at the quays and those whose draught of water obliged them to anchor in the roads the sun rather low on the horizon struck full on the houses of the town bringing out their whiteness outside some wooden cabins and some made of reeds showed the quarter inhabited by the bedouins soon djeddah was shut out from view by the shadows of night and the nautilus found herself under water slightly phosphorescent the next day the of february we sighted several ships running to windward the nautilus returned to its submarine navigation but at noon when her bearings were taken the sea being deserted she rose again to her waterline accompanied by ned and conseil i seated myself on the platform the coast on the eastern side looked like a mass faintly printed upon a damp fog we were leaning on the sides of the pinnace talking of one thing and another when ned land stretching out his hand towards a spot on the sea said do you see anything there sir no ned i replied but i have not your eyes you know look well said ned there on the starboard beam about the height of the lantern do you not see a mass which seems to move certainly said i after close attention i see something like a long black body on the top of the water and certainly before long the black object was not more than a mile from us it looked like a great sandbank deposited in the open sea it was a gigantic dugong ned land looked eagerly his eyes shone with covetousness at the sight of the animal his hand seemed ready to harpoon it one would have thought he was awaiting the moment to throw himself into the sea and attack it in its element at this instant captain nemo appeared on the platform he saw the dugong understood the canadian's attitude and addressing him said if you held a harpoon just now master land would it not burn your hand just so sir and you would not be sorry to go back for one day to your trade of a fisherman and to add this cetacean to the list of those you have already killed i should not sir well you can try thank you sir said ned land his eyes flaming only continued the captain i advise you for your own sake not to miss the creature is the dugong dangerous to attack i asked in spite of the canadian's shrug of the shoulders yes replied the captain sometimes the animal turns upon its assailants and overturns their boat but for master land this danger is not to be feared his eye is prompt his arm sure at this moment seven men of the crew mute and immovable as ever mounted the platform one carried a harpoon and a line similar to those employed in catching whales the pinnace was lifted from the bridge pulled from its socket and let down into the sea six oarsmen took their seats and the coxswain went to the tiller ned conseil and i went to the back of the boat you are not coming captain i asked no sir but i wish you good sport the boat put off and lifted by the six rowers drew rapidly towards the dugong which floated about two miles from the nautilus arrived some from the cetacean the speed slackened and the oars dipped noiselessly into the quiet waters ned land harpoon in hand stood in the fore part of the boat the harpoon used for striking the whale is generally attached to a very long cord which runs out rapidly as the wounded creature draws it after him but here the cord was not more than ten fathoms long and the extremity was attached to a small barrel which by floating was to show the course the dugong took under the water i stood and carefully watched the canadian's adversary this dugong which also bears the name of the halicore closely resembles the manatee its oblong body terminated in a lengthened tail and its lateral fins in perfect fingers its difference from the manatee consisted in its upper jaw which was armed with two long and pointed teeth which formed on each side diverging tusks this dugong which ned land was preparing to attack was of colossal dimensions it was more than seven yards long it did not move and seemed to be sleeping on the waves which circumstance made it easier to capture the boat approached within six yards of the animal the oars rested on the rowlocks i half rose ned land his body thrown a little back brandished the harpoon in his experienced hand suddenly a hissing noise was heard and the dugong disappeared the harpoon although thrown with great force had apparently only struck the water curse it exclaimed the canadian furiously i have missed it no said i the creature is wounded look at the blood but your weapon has not stuck in his body chapter x bibbs's room that neat apartment for transients to which the lamidal george had shown him upon his return still bore the appearance of temporary quarters possibly because bibbs had no clear conception of himself as a permanent incumbent however he had set upon the mantelpiece the two photographs that he owned one a group twenty years old his father and mother with jim and roscoe as boys and the other a cabinet of edith at sixteen and upon a table were the books he had taken from his trunk sartor resartus virginibus puerisque huckleberry finn and afterwhiles there were some other books in the trunk a large one which remained unremoved at the foot of the bed adding to the general impression of transiency it contained nearly all the possessions as well as the secret life of bibbs sheridan and bibbs sat beside it the day after his interview with his father raking over a small collection of manuscripts in the top tray some of these he glanced through dubiously finding little comfort in them but one made him smile then he shook his head ruefully indeed and ruefully began to read it it was written on paper stamped hood sanitarium and bore the title leisure a man may keep a quiet heart at seventy miles an hour but not if he is running the train nor is the habit of contemplation a useful quality in the stoker of a foundry furnace it will not be found to recommend him to the approbation of his superiors for a profession adapted solely to the pursuit of happiness in thinking i would choose that of an invalid his money is time and he may spend it on olympus it will not suffice to be an amateur invalid to my way of thinking the perfect practitioner must be to all outward purposes already dead if he is to begin the perfect enjoyment of life his serenity must not be disturbed by rumors of recovery he must lie serene in his long chair in the sunshine the world must be on the other side of the wall and the wall must be so thick and so high that he cannot hear the roaring of the furnace fires and the screaming of the whistles peace having read so far as the word peace bibbs suffered an interruption interesting as a coincidence of contrast high voices sounded in the hall just outside his door and it became evident that a woman's quarrel was in progress the parties to it having begun it in edith's room and continuing it vehemently as they came out into the hall yes you better go home bibbs heard his sister vociferating shrilly you better go home and keep your mind a little more on your husband edie edie he heard his mother remonstrating as peacemaker you see here this was sibyl and her voice was both acrid and tremulous don't you talk to me that way i came here to tell mother sheridan what i'd heard and to let her tell father sheridan if she thought she ought to and i did it for your own good yes you did and edith's gibing laughter tooted loudly yes you did you didn't have any other reason oh no you don't want to break it up between bobby lamhorn and me because edie edie now now oh hush up mamma i'd like to know then if she says her new friends tell her he's got such a reputation that he oughtn't to come here what about his not going to her house how i've explained that to mother sheridan sibyl's voice indicated that she was descending the stairs married people are not the same some things that should be shielded from a young girl this seemed to have no very soothing effect upon edith shielded from a young girl she shrilled you seem pretty willing to be the shield you look out roscoe doesn't notice what kind of a shield you are sibyl's answer was inaudible but mrs sheridan's flurried attempts at pacification were renewed now edie edie she means it for your good and you'd oughtn't to oh hush up mamma and let me alone if you dare tell papa now now i'm not going to tell him and maybe you've got to promise never to tell him the girl cried passionately well we'll see you just come back in your own room and we'll no i won't talk it over stop pulling me let me alone and edith flinging herself violently upon bibbs's door jerked it open swung round it into the room slammed the door behind her and threw herself face down upon the bed in such a riot of emotion that she had no perception of bibbs's presence in the room gasping and sobbing in a passion of tears she beat the coverlet and pillows with her clenched fists sneak she babbled aloud sneak cat bibbs saw that she did not know he was there and he went softly toward the door hoping to get away before she became aware of him but some sound of his movement reached her and she sat up startled facing him xi when diotti and old sanders left the house they walked rapidly down fifth avenue it was after eleven and the streets were bare of pedestrians but cabs came up the avenue looking at a distance like a trail of megatheriums gliding through the darkness the piercing wind made the men hasten their steps the old man by a motion keeping up with the longer strides and measured tread of the younger when they reached fourteenth street the elder said i live but a block from here pointing eastward what do you say to a hot toddy it will warm the cockles of your heart come over to my house and i'll mix you the best drink in new york the younger thought the suggestion a good one and they turned toward the house of old sanders it was a neat red brick house well in from the street off the line of the more pretentious buildings on either side as the old man opened the iron gate the police officer on the beat passed he peered into the faces of the men and recognizing sanders said tough night sir very replied the addressed all good old gentlemen should be in bed at this hour said the officer lifting one foot after the other in an effort to keep warm and in so doing showing little terpsichorean grace it's only the shank of the evening officer rejoined the old man as he fumbled with the latch key and finally opened the door the two men entered and the officer passed on every man has a fad one will tell you he sees nothing in billiards or pool or golf or tennis but will grow enthusiastic over the scientific possibilities of you agree with him only you substitute skittles for old sanders fad was mixing toddies and punches the nectar of the gods pales into nothingness when compared with a toddy such as i make said he ambrosia may have been all right for the degenerates of the old grecian and roman days but an american gentleman demands a toddy a hot toddy and then he proceeded with circumspection and dignity to demonstrate the process of decocting that mysterious beverage the two men took off their overcoats and went into the a pile of logs burned brightly in the the old man threw another on the burning heap filled the kettle with water and hung it over the fire next he went to the sideboard and brought forth the various ingredients for the toddy how do you like america said the elder with commonplace indifference as he crunched a lump of sugar in the bottom of the glass dissolving the particles with a few drops of water very much indeed said the tuscan with the air of a man who had answered the question before great country for girls said sanders pouring a liberal quantity of old tom gin in the glass and placing it where it gradually would get warm and for men responded diotti enthusiastically men don't amount to much here women run everything retorted the elder while he repeated the process of preparing the sugar and gin in the second glass the kettle began to sing that's music for you chuckled the old man raising the lid to see if the water had boiled sufficiently do you know i think a dinner horn and a singing kettle beat a symphony all hollow for real melody and he lifted the kettle from the diotti smiled with mathematical accuracy the old man filled the two tumblers with boiling water try that handing a glass of the toddy to diotti you will find it all right and the old man drew an armchair toward the smacking his lips in anticipation the violinist placed his chair closer to the fire and sipped the drink your country is noted for its beautiful women we have exquisite types of femininity in tuscany said the young man with patriotic ardor any as fine looking as as as well say the young lady we dined with miss wallace queried the tuscan yes miss wallace this rather impatiently she is very beautiful said diotti with solemn admiration have you ever seen any one prettier questioned the old man after a second prolonged sip i have no desire to see any one more beautiful said the violinist feeling that the other was trying to draw him out and determined not to yield you will pardon the inquisitiveness of an old man but are not you musicians a most impressionable lot we are human answered the violinist i imagined you were like sailors and had a sweetheart in every port that would be a delightful prospect to one having polygamous aspirations but for myself one sweetheart is enough laughingly said the musician only one well here's to her with this nectar fit for the gods and goddesses of olympus let us drink to her said old sanders with convivial dignity his glass raised on high here's wishing health and happiness to the tuscan beauty whom you love and who loves you stop said diotti we will drink to the first part of that toast and holding his glass against that of his bibulous host continued to the women of my country exacting of their lovers obedient to their parents and loyal to their husbands and his voice rose in sonorous rhythm with the words contents the tale of peter rabbit the tailor of gloucester the tale of squirrel nutkin the tale of benjamin bunny the tale of two bad mice the tale of mrs the pie and the the tale of mr jeremy fisher the story of a fierce bad rabbit the story of miss moppet the tale of tom kitten the tale of jemima the pudding the tale of the flopsy bunnies the tale of mrs tittlemouse the tale of timmy tiptoes the tale of mr tod the tale of pigling bland ginger and pickles the tale of peter rabbit once upon a time there were four little rabbits and their names were flopsy mopsy and peter they lived with their mother in a underneath the root of a very big now my dears said old mrs rabbit one morning you may go into the fields or down the lane but don't go into mr mcgregor's garden your father had an accident there he was put in a pie by mrs mcgregor now run along and don't get into mischief i am going out then old mrs rabbit took a basket and her umbrella and went through the wood to the baker's she bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns flopsy mopsy and who were good little bunnies went down the lane to gather blackberries but peter who was very naughty ran straight away to mr mcgregor's garden and squeezed under the gate first he ate some lettuces and some french beans and then he ate some radishes and then feeling rather sick he went to look for some parsley but round the end of a cucumber frame whom should he meet but mr mcgregor mr mcgregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages but he jumped up and ran after peter waving a rake and calling out stop thief peter was most dreadfully frightened he rushed all over the garden for he had forgotten the way back to the gate he lost one of his shoes among the cabbages and the other shoe amongst the potatoes after losing them he ran on four legs and went faster so that i think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket it was a blue jacket with brass buttons quite new peter gave himself up for lost and shed big tears but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows who flew to him in great excitement and implored him to exert himself mr mcgregor came up with a sieve which he intended to pop upon the top of peter but peter wriggled out just in time leaving his jacket behind him and rushed into the toolshed and jumped into a can it would have been a beautiful thing to hide in if it had not had so much water in it mr mcgregor was quite sure that peter was somewhere in the toolshed perhaps hidden underneath a flower pot he began to turn them over carefully looking under each presently peter sneezed kertyschoo mr mcgregor was after him in no time and tried to put his foot upon peter who jumped out of a window upsetting three plants the window was too small for mr mcgregor and he was tired of running after peter he went back to his work peter sat down to rest he was out of breath and trembling with fright and he had not the least idea which way to go also he was very damp with sitting in that can after a time he began to wander about going lippity lippity not very fast and looking all around he found a door in a wall but it was locked and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath an old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood peter asked her the way to the gate but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer she only shook her head at him peter began to cry then he tried to find his way straight across the garden but he became more and more puzzled presently he came to a pond where mr mcgregor filled his a white cat was staring at some goldfish she sat very very still but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her he has heard about cats from his cousin little benjamin bunny he went back towards the toolshed but suddenly quite close to him he heard the noise of a hoe scratch scratch scritch peter scuttered underneath the bushes but presently as nothing happened he came out and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over the first thing he saw was mr mcgregor hoeing onions his back was turned towards peter and beyond him was the gate peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow and started running as fast as he could go along a straight walk behind some bushes mr mcgregor caught sight of him at the corner but peter did not care he slipped underneath the gate and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden mr mcgregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a to frighten the blackbirds peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big he was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the and shut his eyes his mother was busy cooking she wondered what he had done with his clothes it was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that peter had lost in a fortnight psams travel car she would have put travelling carriage but she made the letters too big so there was no room the bag was made into a bag with old sewing machine and the strings of it were and best red hair ribbons at when the boys had come home with a most unfavourable report of the st park ducks anthea ventured to awaken the psammead and to show it its new travelling bag humph it said sniffing a little contemptuously yet at the same time affectionately not so dusty the psammead seemed to pick up very easily the kind of things that people said nowadays for a creature that had in its time associated with megatheriums and pterodactyls its quickness was really wonderful more worthy of me it said than the kind of bag given away with a pound of plaice when do you propose to take me out in it i should like a rest from taking you or us anywhere said cyril but jane said i want to go to egypt i did like that egyptian princess that came to marry the king in babylon she told me about the larks they have in egypt and the cats do go there and i told her what the bird things on the amulet were like and she said it was egyptian writing the others exchanged looks of silent rejoicing at the thought of their cleverness in having concealed from jane the terrors they had suffered in the dungeon below the euphrates so nice too jane went on because of doctor scripture history i would like to go there when joseph was dreaming those curious dreams or when moses was doing wonderful things with snakes and sticks i care about snakes said anthea shuddering well we be in at that part but babylon was lovely we had cream and sweet sticky stuff and i expect the same there was a good deal of discussion but it all ended in agreeing to idea and next morning directly after breakfast which was kippers and very nice the psammead was invited to get into his travelling carriage the moment after it had done so with stiff furry reluctance like that of a cat when you want to nurse it and its ideas are not the same as yours old nurse came in well chickies she said are you feeling very dull oh no nurse dear said anthea having a lovely time just going off to see some old ancient relics ah said old nurse the royal academy i suppose go wasting your money too reckless all she cleared away the kipper bones and the and when she had swept up the crumbs and removed the cloth the amulet was held up and the order given just as duchesses and other people give it to their coachmen to egypt please said anthea when cyril had uttered the wonderful name of power when moses was there added jane and there in the dingy fitzroy street the amulet grew big and it was an arch and through it they saw a blue blue sky and a running river no stop said cyril and pulled down hand with the amulet in it what silly cuckoos we all are he said of course we go we leave home for a single minute now for fear that minute should be the minute what minute be what minute asked jane impatiently trying to get her hand away from cyril the minute when the queen of babylon comes said cyril and then everyone saw it for some days life flowed in a very slow dusty uneventful stream the children could never go out all at once because they never knew when the king of babylon would go out lion hunting and leave his queen free to pay them that surprise visit to which she was without doubt eagerly looking forward so they took it in turns two and two to go out and to stay in the would have been much duller than they were but for the new interest taken in them by the learned gentleman he called anthea in one day to show her a beautiful necklace of purple and gold beads i saw one like that she said in in the british museum perhaps i like to call the place where i saw it babylon said anthea cautiously a pretty fancy said the learned gentleman and quite correct too because as a matter of fact these beads did come from babylon the other three were all out that day the boys had been going to the zoo and jane had said so plaintively sure i am fonder of rhinoceroses than either of you are that anthea had told her to run along then and she had run catching the boys before that part of the road where fitzroy street suddenly becomes fitzroy square i think babylon is most frightfully interesting said anthea i do have such interesting dreams about it at least not dreams exactly but quite as wonderful do sit down and tell me said he so she sat down and told and he asked her a lot of questions and she answered them as well as she could nikobob refuses a crown almost the first persons that zella saw when she landed from the boat at regos were her father and mother nikobob and his wife had been greatly worried when their little daughter failed to return from coregos so they had set out to discover what had become of her when they reached the city of regos that very morning they were astonished to hear news of all the strange events that had taken place still they found comfort when told that zella had been seen in the boat of prince inga which had gone to the north then while they wondered what this could mean the boat appeared again with their daughter in it and they ran down to the shore to give her a welcome and many joyful kisses inga invited the good people to the palace of king gos where he conferred with them as well as with rinkitink and bilbil now that the king and queen of regos and coregos have run away he said there is no one to rule these islands so it is my duty to appoint a new ruler and as nikobob zella's father is an honest and worthy man i shall make him the king of the twin islands me cried nikobob astounded by this speech i beg your highness on my bended knees not to do so cruel a thing as to make me king why not inquired rinkitink i'm a king and i know how it feels i assure you good nikobob that i quite enjoy my high rank although a jeweled crown is rather heavy to wear in hot weather with you noble sir it is different said nikobob for you are far from your kingdom and its trials and worries and may do as you please but to remain in regos as king over these fierce and unruly warriors would be to live in constant anxiety and peril and the chances are that they would murder me within a month as i have done no harm to anyone and have tried to be a good and upright man i do not think that i should be condemned to such a dreadful fate very well replied inga we will say no more about your being king i merely wanted to make you rich and prosperous as i had promised zella please forget that promise pleaded the earnestly i have been safe from molestation for many years because i was poor and possessed nothing that anyone else could envy but if you make me rich and prosperous i shall at once become the prey of thieves and marauders and probably will lose my life in the attempt to protect my fortune inga looked at the man in surprise what then can i do to please you he inquired nothing more than to allow me to go home to my poor cabin said nikobob perhaps remarked king rinkitink the has more wisdom concealed in that hard head of his than we gave him credit for but let us use that wisdom for the present to counsel us what to do in this emergency what you call my wisdom said nikobob is merely common sense i have noticed that some men become rich and are scorned by some and robbed by others other men become famous and are mocked at and derided by their fellows but the poor and humble man who lives unnoticed and unknown escapes all these troubles and is the only one who can appreciate the joy of living if i had a hand instead of a cloven hoof i'd like to shake hands with you nikobob said bilbil the goat but the poor man must not have a cruel master or he is undone during the council they found indeed that the advice of the was both shrewd and sensible and they profited much by his words inga gave captain buzzub the command of the warriors and made him promise to keep his men quiet and orderly if he could then the boy allowed all of king gos's former slaves except those who came from pingaree to choose what boats they required and to stock them with provisions and row away to their own countries when these had departed with grateful thanks and many blessings showered upon the boy prince who had set them free inga made preparations to send his own people home where they were told to rebuild their houses and then erect a new royal palace they were then to await patiently the coming of king kitticut or prince inga my greatest worry said the boy to his friends is to know whom to appoint to take charge of this work of restoring pingaree to its former condition my men are all pearl fishers and although willing and honest have no talent for directing others how to work while the preparations for departure were being made nikobob offered to direct the men of pingaree and did so in a very capable manner as the island had been despoiled of all its valuable furniture and draperies and rich cloths and paintings and statuary and the like as well as gold and silver and ornaments inga thought it no more than just that they be replaced by the spoilers so he directed his people to search through the storehouses of king gos and to regain all their goods and chattels that could be found also he instructed them to take as much else as they required to make their new homes comfortable so that many boats were loaded full of goods that would enable the people to restore pingaree to its former state of comfort an etude for emma if you listen long enough and earnestly enough and with ear sufficiently attuned to the music of this sphere there will come to you this reward the violins and oboes and cellos and brasses of humanity which seemed all at variance with each other will unite as one instrument seeming discords and dissonances will blend into harmony and the wail and blare and thrum of humanity's orchestra will sound in your ear the sublime melody of that great symphony called life in her sunny little private office on the twelfth floor of the great that housed the t a buck company emma mcchesney buck sat listening to the that were wafted to her mellowed by height and distance the noises taken separately were the sounds common to a busy new york by the time they reached the little office on the twelfth floor they were softened mellowed debrutalized welded into a weird choirlike chant first high then low rising swelling dying away rising again to a dull roar with now and then vast undertones like the rumbling of a cathedral emma knew that the high clear tenor note was the shrill cry of the lame newsie at the corner of sixth avenue and street those deep thunderous bass notes were the combined reverberation of nearby l trains distant subway and clanging surface cars that sharp staccato was a motorman clanging his bell of warning these things she knew but she liked nevertheless to shut her eyes for a moment in the midst of her busy day and listen to the chant of the city as it came up to her subdued softened strangely beautified the sound saddened even while it filled her with a certain exaltation we have no one word for that sensation the german there's a language has it weltschmerz as distance softened the harsh sounds to her ears so time and experience had given her a perspective on life itself she saw it not as a series of incidents pleasant and unpleasant but as a great universal scheme too mighty to comprehend a scheme that always worked itself out in some miraculous way she had had a singularly full life had emma mcchesney buck a life replete with work leavened by sorrows sweetened with happiness these ingredients make for tolerance she saw for example how the capable modern staff in the main business office had forged ahead of old pop henderson pop henderson had been head bookkeeper for years but the pen in his trembling hand made queer spidery marks in the ledgers now and his figure seven was very likely to look like a drunken letter z the great bulk of his work was done by the capable comely miss kelly who could juggle figures like a cinquevalli his shaking yellow hand was no match for miss kelly's cool firm fingers but he stayed on at buck's and no one dreamed of insulting him with talk of a pension least of all emma she saw the pathetic old man not only as a figure but as a symbol jock mcchesney very young very handsome very successful coming on to new york from chicago to be married in june found his mother wrapped in this contemplative calm now emma mcchesney buck mother of an son was also surprisingly young and astonishingly handsome and highly successful jock in a lucid moment the day before his wedding took occasion to comment rather resentfully on his mother's attitude it seems to me he said gloomily that for a mother whose only son is about to be handed over to what the writers call the other woman you're pretty resigned not to say cheerful emma glanced up at him as he stood there so tall and straight and altogether good to look at and the glow of love and pride in her eyes belied the lightness of her words i know it she said with mock seriousness and it worries me i can't imagine why i fail to feel those pangs that mothers are supposed to suffer at this time i ought to rend my garments and beat my breast but i can't help thinking of what a stunning girl grace galt is and what a brain she has and how lucky you are to get her any girl with the future that girl had in the advertising field who'll give up four thousand a year and her independence to marry a man does it for love let me tell you if anybody knows you better than your mother son i'd hate to know who it is and if anybody loves you more than your mother well we needn't go into that because it would have to be hypothetical anyway you see jock i've loved you so long and so well that i know your faults as well as your virtues and i love you not in spite of them but because of them oh i don't know interrupted jock with some warmth i'm not perfect but a fellow perfect jock mcchesney when i think of grace's feelings when she discovers that you never close a closet door when i contemplate her emotions on hearing your howl at finding one seed in your orange juice at breakfast when she learns of your secret and unholy passion for neckties that have a dash of red in em and how you have to be restrained by force from somebody's little girl if i were just to tell the things that bessie bell remembered i should tell you some very strange things bessie bell did not know whether she remembered them or just knew them or whether they just grew those strange things in some strange country that never was anywhere in the world for when bessie bell tried to tell about those strange things great grown wise people said no no bessie bell there is nothing in the world like that so bessie bell just remembered and wondered she remembered how somewhere sometime there was a window where you could look out and see everything green little and green and always changing and moving away away beyond everything little and green and moving all the time but great grown wise folks said no there is no window in all the world like that and once when some one gave bessie bell a little round red apple she caught her breath very quickly and her little heart jumped and then thumped very loudly that is the way it seemed to her and she remembered little apple trees all just alike and little apple trees in rows all just alike on top of those and again on top of those until they came to a great row of big round red apples on top of all rut great grown people said no no bessie bell there are no apple trees in all the world like that and one time bessie bell was at a pretty house and somebody sat her on a little low chair and said keep still bessie bell she kept still so long that at last she began to be afraid to move at all and she got afraid even to crook up her little finger for fear it would pop off loud she had kept still so long that all her round little fingers and her round little legs felt so stiff then one great grown person said she seems a very quiet child and the other said she is a very quiet child sometimes but just then bessie bell turned her head and though her round little neck felt stiff it did not pop and she saw something in a corner that was blue green and brown and soft and she forgot how afraid to move she was and she forgot how stiff she thought she was and she forgot how still she was told to be and she jumped up and ran to the corner and cried out pretty pretty pretty one grown person took up the thing that was blue and green and brown and soft and waved it to and fro to and fro in front of bessie bell and bessie bell clapped her hands and jumped for joy and laughed and cried boo boo boo and bessie bell ran right into the thing that was blue and green and brown and soft and she threw out her round little arms and clasped them about the thing that was blue and green and brown and soft and she pulled it over her face and she laughed and cried for joy because she remembered but the great grown person who had brought bessie bell to the pretty house said oh bessie bell why bessie bell for shame bessie bell how could you do so to the beautiful so bessie bell could only cry and that very softly and feel ashamed as she was bid and forget what it was that she remembered bessie bell might have remembered one time when a great house was all desolate and when nobody or nothing at all breathed in the whole great big house but one little tiny girl and one great big white cat with just one black spot on its tail the nurse that always had played so nicely with the tiny little girl was lying with her cheek in her hand over yonder the grandmother who had always talked so much to the tiny little girl was not talking any more the tiny little girl was so sick that she only just could breathe quickly just so and just so if bessie bell could remember that it was only that she remembered the big white cat like a big soft dream and she might have remembered how now and then the big cat put out a paw and touched the little girl's cheek like a soft white and that little girl had on a that was long and soft and white and on that little white was worked oh so carefully in linen thread bessie bell then the few people who walked about the world in came in to that big house and they took up that little tiny girl that breathed so softly and so quickly just so and they read on her little white the words written with the linen thread bessie bell and they said let us take this little girl with us they put a big soft white blanket around the little girl and walked out of the big house with her someone carrying her in strong arms and the big white cat got down off the big white bed and rubbed himself against the bedpost and went round and round the and rubbed himself round and round the ralph rides the wood under the mountains a long way now rode ralph and naught befell him but the fashion of the wood and as he rode the heart within him was lightened that he had escaped from all the confusion and the lying of those aliens who knew him not nor his kindred and yet would all use him each for his own ends and withal he was glad that he was riding all alone upon his quest but free unwounded and well weaponed the wood was not very thick whereas he rode so that he could see the whereabouts of the sun and rode east as far as he could judge it some little victual he had with him and he found woodland fruit ripening here and there and eked out his bread therewith neither did water fail him for he rode a good way up along a woodland stream that cleft the thicket coming down as he deemed from the mountains and thereby he made the more way but at last he deemed that he must needs leave it as it turned overmuch to the north the light was failing when he came into a woodlawn amidst of which was a pool of water and all that day he had had no adventure with beast or man since he had sundered from agatha so he lay down and slept there with his naked sword by his side and awoke not till the sun was high in the heavens next morning then he arose at once and went on his way after he had washed him and eaten a morsel after a little the thick of the wood gave out and the land was no longer flat as it had been but was of dales and of hills not blinded by trees in this land he saw much deer as hart and wild swine and he happened also on a bear who was about a honey tree and had taken much comb from the wild bees on him ralph drew his sword and drave him exceeding loth from his purchase so that the knight dined off the bear's thieving another time he came across a bent where on the south side grew vines well fruited and the grapes and he ate well thereof before he went on his way before nightfall he came on that same stream again and it was now running straight from the east so he slept that night on the bank thereof on the morrow he rode up along it a great way till again it seemed to be coming overmuch from the north and then he left it and made on east as near as he could guess it by the sun now he passed through thickets at whiles not very great and betwixt them rode hilly land grassed mostly with long coarse grass and with whin and scattered about thence he saw again from time to time the huge wall of the mountains rising up into the air like a great black cloud that would swallow up the sky and though the sight was terrible yet it gladdened him since he knew that he was on the right way so far he rode going on the whole till at last there was a great before him so that he could see no ending to it either north or south it was now late in the afternoon and ralph pondered whether he should abide the night where he was and sleep the night there or whether he should press on in hope of winning to some clear place before dark so whereas he was in a place both rough and waterless he deemed it better to go on after he had rested his horse and let him bite the herbage a while then he rode his ways and entered the wood and made the most of the way chapter ralph meeteth with another adventure in the wood under the mountain soon the wood grew very thick of though there was no undergrowth so that when the sun sank it grew dark very speedily but he still rode on in the dusk and there were but few wild things and those mostly voiceless in the wood and it was without wind and very still now he thought he heard the sound of a horse going behind him or on one side and he wondered whether the chace were up and hastened what he might till at last it grew black night and he was constrained to abide so he got off his horse and leaned his back against a tree and had the beast's reins over his arm and now he listened again carefully and was quite sure that he could hear the footsteps of some beast going nowise far from him he laughed inwardly and said to himself if the chacer were to pass but three feet from my nose he should be none the wiser but if he hear me or my horse and therewith he cast a lap of his cloak over the horse's head lest he should whinny if he became aware of the other beast and so there he stood abiding and the noise grew greater till he could hear clearly the drawing nigh till they came very nigh and then stopped preface the king of the golden river is a delightful fairy tale told with all ruskin's charm of style his appreciation of mountain scenery and with his usual insistence upon drawing a moral none the less it is quite unlike his other writings all his life long his pen was busy interpreting nature and pictures and architecture or persuading to better views those whom he believed to be in error or arousing with the white heat of a prophet's zeal those whom he knew to be unawakened there is indeed a good deal of the prophet about john ruskin though essentially an interpreter with a singularly fine appreciation of beauty no man of the nineteenth century felt more keenly that he had a mission and none was more loyal to what he believed that mission to be while still in college what seemed a chance incident gave occasion and direction to this mission a certain english reviewer had ridiculed the work of the artist turner now ruskin held turner to be the greatest landscape painter the world had seen and he immediately wrote a notable article in his defense slowly this article grew into a pamphlet and the pamphlet into a book the first volume of modern painters the young man awoke to find himself famous in the next few years four more volumes were added to modern painters and the other notable series upon art the stones of venice and the seven lamps of architecture were sent forth then in when ruskin was about forty years old there came a great change his genius for making the appreciation of beauty a common possession was deflected from its true field he had been asking himself what are the conditions that produce great art and the answer he found declared that art cannot be separated from life nor life from industry and industrial conditions a civilization founded upon unrestricted competition therefore seemed to him necessarily feeble in appreciation of the beautiful and unequal to its creation in this way loyalty to his mission bred apparent disloyalty delightful discourses upon art gave way to fervid pleas for humanity for the rest of his life he became a very earnest if not always very wise social reformer and a passionate pleader for what he believed to be true economic ideals there is nothing of all this in the king of the golden river unlike his other works it was written merely to entertain scarcely that since it was not written for publication at all but to meet a challenge set him by a young girl the circumstance is interesting after taking his degree at oxford ruskin was threatened with consumption and hurried away from the chill and damp of england to the south of europe after two years of fruitful travel and study he came back improved in health but not strong and often depressed in spirit it was at this time that the guys scotch friends of his father and mother came for a visit to his home near london and with them their little daughter euphemia the coming of this beautiful vivacious child opened a new chapter in ruskin's life though but twelve years old she sought to enliven the melancholy student absorbed in art and geology and bade him leave these and write for her a fairy tale he accepted and after but two sittings presented her with this charming story the incident proved to have awakened in him a greater interest than at first appeared for a few years later effie grey became john ruskin's wife meantime she had given the manuscript to a friend nine years after it was written this friend with john ruskin's permission gave the story to the world it was published in london in with illustrations by the celebrated richard doyle and at once became a favorite three editions were printed the first year and soon it had found its way into german italian and welsh since then countless children have had cause to be grateful for the young girl's challenge that won the story of gluck's golden mug and the highly satisfactory handling of the black brothers by southwest wind esquire for this edition new drawings have been prepared by mr hiram p barnes they very successfully preserve the spirit of doyle's illustrations which unfortunately are not technically suitable for reproduction here in the original manuscript there was an epilogue bearing the heading charitie a morning hymn of treasure valley whither gluck had returned to dwell and where the inheritance lost by cruelty was regained by love the beams of morning are renewed the valley laughs their light to see and earth is bright with gratitude and heaven with charitie coe contents chapter i how the agricultural system of the black brothers was interfered with by southwest wind esquire chapter ii of the proceedings of the three brothers after the visit of southwest wind esquire and how little gluck had an interview with the king of golden river chapter iii how mr hans set off on an expedition to the golden river and how he prospered therein chapter iv how mr schwartz set off on an expedition to the golden river and how he prospered therein chapter v how little gluck set off on an expedition to the golden river and how he prospered therein with other matters of interest chapter xi faith and unfaith at jane withersteen's home the promise made to mrs larkin to care for little fay had begun to be fulfilled like a gleam of sunlight through the cottonwoods was the coming of the child to the gloomy house of withersteen the big silent halls echoed with childish laughter in the shady court where jane spent many of the hot july days fay's tiny feet pattered over the stone flags and splashed in the amber stream she prattled incessantly what difference jane thought a child made in her home it had never been a real home she discovered even the tidiness and neatness she had so observed and upon which she had insisted to her women became in the light of fay's smile habits that now lost their importance fay littered the court with jane's books and papers and other toys her fancy improvised and many a strange craft went floating down the little brook and it was owing to fay's presence that jane withersteen came to see more of lassiter the rider had for the most part kept to the sage he rode for her but he did not seek her except on business and jane had to acknowledge in pique that her overtures had been made in vain fay however captured lassiter the moment he first laid eyes on her jane was present at the meeting and there was something about it which dimmed her sight and softened her toward this foe of her people the rider had clanked into the court a tired yet wary man always looking for the attack upon him that was inevitable and might come from any quarter and he had walked right upon little fay the child had been beautiful even in her rags and amid the surroundings of the hovel in the sage but now in a pretty white dress with her shining curls brushed and her face clean and rosy she was lovely she left her play and looked up at lassiter if there was not an instinct for all three of them in that meeting an unreasoning tendency toward a closer intimacy then jane withersteen believed she had been subject to a queer fancy she imagined any child would have feared lassiter and fay larkin had been a lonely a solitary elf of the sage not at all an ordinary child and exquisitely shy with strangers she watched lassiter with great round grave eyes but showed no fear the rider gave jane a favorable report of cattle and horses and as he took the seat to which she invited him little fay edged as much as half an inch nearer jane replied to his look of inquiry and told fay's story the rider's gray earnest gaze troubled her then he turned to fay and smiled in a way that made jane doubt her sense of the true relation of things how could lassiter smile so at a child when he had made so many children fatherless but he did smile and to the gentleness she had seen a few times he added something that was infinitely sad and sweet jane's intuition told her that lassiter had never been a father but if life ever so blessed him he would be a good one fay also must have found that smile singularly winning for she edged closer and closer and then by way of feminine capitulation went to jane from whose side she bent a beautiful glance upon the rider lassiter only smiled at her jane watched them and realized that now was the moment she should seize if she was ever to win this man from his hatred but the step was not easy to take the more she saw of lassiter the more she respected him and the greater her respect the harder it became to lend herself to mere coquetry yet as she thought of her great motive of tull and of that other whose name she had schooled herself never to think of in connection with milly erne's avenger she suddenly found she had no choice and her creed gave her boldness far beyond the limit to which vanity would have led her lassiter i see so little of you now she said and was conscious of heat in her cheeks i've been riding hard he replied but you can't live in the saddle you come in sometimes won't you come here to see me oftener is that an order nonsense i simply ask you to come to see me when you find time why the query once heard was not so embarrassing to jane as she might have imagined moreover it established in her mind a fact that there existed actually other than selfish reasons for her wanting to see him and as she had been bold so she determined to be both honest and brave i've reasons only one of which i need mention she answered if it's possible i want to change you toward my people and on the moment i can conceive of little i wouldn't do to gain that end how much better and freer jane felt after that confession she meant to show him that there was one mormon who could play a game or wage a fight in the open i the light in the window a rickety carriage was slowly ascending the hill and from the place of honour on the back seat the single passenger surveyed the country with interest and admiration the driver of that ancient chariot was an awkward young fellow possibly years of age with sharp knees large red hands high and abundant hair of a shade verging upon orange he was not unpleasant to look upon however for he had a certain evident honesty and he was disposed to be friendly to every one be you comfortable miss he asked with apparent solicitude very comfortable thank you was the quiet response he urged his venerable steeds to a gait of about two miles an hour then turned sideways be you goin to stay long miss all summer i think do tell the young woman smiled in listless amusement but joe took it for conversational encouragement city folks is dretful bashful when they's away from home he said to himself he clucked again to his unheeding horses shifted his quid and was casting about for a new topic when a light broke in upon him i guess now that you're miss hathaway's niece what's come to stay in her house while she goes gallivantin and travellin in furrin parts ben't you i am miss hathaway's niece and i have never been here before where does she live up yander he flourished the discarded which served as a whip and pointed out a small white house on the brow of the hill reflection brought him the conviction that his remark concerning miss hathaway was a social mistake since his passenger sat very straight and asked no more questions the weary wheels creaked but the collapse which miss thorne momentarily expected was mercifully postponed being gifted with imagination she experienced the emotion of a wreck without bodily harm as in a photograph she beheld herself suddenly projected into space followed by her suit case felt her new hat wrenched from her head and saw hopeless gravel stains upon the tailored gown which was the pride of her heart she thought a sprained ankle would be the inevitable outcome of the fall but was spared the pain of it for the inability to realise an actual hurt is the redeeming feature of imagination suddenly there was a snort of terror from one of the horses and the carriage stopped abruptly ruth clutched her suit case and umbrella instantly prepared for the worst but joe reassured her now don't you go and get skeered miss he said kindly taint nothin in the world but a rabbit mamie can't never get used to rabbits someways he indicated one of the horses a high animal sketched on a generous plan whose ribs and joints protruded and whose rough white coat had been to grey hush now mamie he said taint nothin mamie looked around inquiringly with one ear erect and the other at an angle a cataract partially concealed one eye but in the other was a world of wickedness and knowledge modified by a certain reserve g long mamie ruth laughed as the horse resumed motion in mincing maidenly steps what's the other one's name she asked him his name's alfred mamie's his mother miss thorne endeavoured to conceal her amusement and joe was pleased because the ice was broken i change their names every once in a while he said cause it makes some variety but now i've named about all the names i know the road wound upward in its own lazy fashion and there were trees at the left though only one or two shaded the hill itself as they approached the summit a girl in a blue gingham dress and a neat white apron came out to meet them come right in miss thorne she said and i'll explain it to you ruth descended inwardly vowing that she would ride no more in joe's carriage and after giving some directions about her trunk followed her guide indoors the house was certainly entitled to the respect accorded to age it was substantial but unpretentious in outline and had not been painted for a long time the faded green shutters blended harmoniously with the greyish white background and the piazza which was evidently an unhappy afterthought of the architect had two or three new shingles on its roof you see it's this way miss thorne the maid began volubly miss hathaway she went earlier than she laid out to on account of the folks decidin to take a steamer that sailed beforehand before the other one i mean she went in sech a hurry that she didn't have time to send you word and get an answer but she's left a letter here for you for she trusted to your comin miss thorne laid her hat and jacket aside and settled herself comfortably in a rocker the maid returned presently with a letter which miss hathaway had sealed with half an ounce of red wax presumably in a laudable effort to remove temptation from the path of the wholesome farmer's daughter who stood near by with her hands on her hips miss ruth thorne the letter began dear niece i am writing this in a hurry as we are going a week before we expected to i think you will find everything all right hepsey will attend to the for i don't suppose you know much about it coming from the city she's a girl but she's set in her ways and you'll have to kinder give in to her but any time when you can't just speak to her sharp and she'll do as you tell her to john bland my lamb you are so very small you have not learned to read at all yet never a printed book withstands the urgence of your dimpled hands so though this book is for yourself let mother keep it on the shelf till you can read o days that pass that day will come too soon alas contents beautiful as the day golden guineas being wanted wings no wings a castle and no dinner a siege and bed bigger than the baker's boy grown up scalps the last wish chapter beautiful as the day the house was three miles from the station but before the dusty hired fly had rattled along for five minutes the children began to put their heads out of the carriage window and to say aren't we nearly there and every time they passed a house which was not very often they all said oh is this it but it never was till they reached the very top of the hill just past the and before you come to the and then there was a white house with a green garden and an orchard beyond and mother said here we are how white the house is said robert and look at the roses said anthea and the plums said jane it is rather decent cyril admitted the baby said wanty go walky and the fly stopped with a last rattle and jolt everyone got its legs kicked or its feet trodden on in the scramble to get out of the carriage that very minute but no one seemed to mind mother curiously enough was in no hurry to get out and even when she had come down slowly and by the step and with no jump at all she seemed to wish to see the boxes carried in and even to pay the driver instead of joining in that first glorious rush round the garden and the orchard and the thorny thistly briery brambly wilderness beyond the broken gate and the dry fountain at the side of the house but the children were wiser for once it was not really a pretty house at all it was quite ordinary and mother thought it was rather inconvenient and was quite annoyed at there being no shelves to speak of and hardly a cupboard in the place father used to say that the ironwork on the roof and coping was like an architect's nightmare but the house was deep in the country with no other house in sight and the children had been in london for two years without so much as once going to the seaside even for a day by an excursion train and so the white house seemed to them a sort of fairy palace set down in an earthly paradise for london is like prison for children especially if their relations are not rich of course there are the shops and the theatres and maskelyne and cook's and things but if your people are rather poor you don't get taken to the theatres and you can't buy things out of the shops and london has none of those nice things that children may play with without hurting the things or themselves such as trees and sand and woods and waters and nearly everything in london is the wrong sort of shape all straight lines and flat streets instead of being all sorts of odd shapes like things are in the country trees are all different as you know and i am sure some tiresome person must have told you that there are no two blades of grass exactly alike but in streets where the blades of grass don't grow everything is like everything else this is why so many children who live in towns are so extremely naughty they do not know what is the matter with them and no more do their fathers and mothers aunts uncles cousins tutors governesses and nurses but i know and so do you now children in the country are naughty sometimes too but that is for quite different reasons the children had explored the gardens and the outhouses thoroughly before they were caught and cleaned for tea and they saw quite well that they were certain to be happy at the white house they thought so from the first moment but when they found the back of the house covered with jasmine and in white flower and smelling like a bottle of the most expensive scent that is ever given for a birthday present and when they had seen the lawn all green and smooth and quite different from the brown grass in the gardens at camden town and when they had found the stable with a loft over it and some old hay still left they were almost certain and when robert had found the broken swing and tumbled out of it and got a lump on his head the size of an egg and cyril had nipped his finger in the door of a hutch that seemed made to keep rabbits in if you ever had any they had no longer any doubts whatever the best part of it all was that there were no rules about not going to places and not doing things in london almost everything is labelled you mustn't touch and though the label is invisible it's just as bad because you know it's there or if you don't you jolly soon get told my cousin fanny we do not keep christmas now as we used to do in old hanover we have not time for it and it does not seem like the same thing christmas however always brings up to me my cousin fanny i suppose because she always was so foolish about christmas my cousin fanny was an old maid indeed to follow st turn of phrase she was an old maid of the old maids no one who saw her a moment could have doubted it old maids have from most people a feeling rather akin to pity a hard heritage they very often have this feeling from the young this must be the hardest part of all to see around them friends each a happy mother of children little ones responding to affection with the sweet caresses of childhood whilst any advances that they their aunts or cousins may make are met with indifference or condescension my cousin fanny was no exception she was as proud as lucifer yet she went through life the part that i knew of bearing the pity of the great majority of the people who knew her she lived at an old place called woodside which had been in the family for a great many years indeed ever since before the revolution the neighborhood dated back to the time of the colony and woodside was one of the old places my cousin grandmother had stood in the door of her chamber with her large scissors in her hand and defied troopers to touch the basket of old which she had hung on her arm the house was a large brick edifice with a pyramidal roof covered with moss small windows porticos with pillars somewhat out of repair a big high hall and a staircase wide enough to drive a gig up it if it could have turned the corners a grove of great forest oaks and poplars densely shaded it and made it look rather gloomy and the garden with the old graveyard covered with periwinkle at one end was almost in front while the side of the wood a primeval forest from which the place took its name came up so close as to form a strong dark background during the war the place like most others in that neighborhood suffered greatly and only a sudden exhibition of spirit on cousin part saved it from a worse fate after the war it went down the fields were poor and grew up in briers and sassafras and the house was too large and out of repair to keep from decay the ownership of it being divided between cousin fanny and other members of the family cousin fanny had no means whatever so that it soon was in a bad condition the rest of the family as they grew up went off compelled by necessity to seek some means of livelihood and would have taken cousin fanny too if she would have gone but she would not go they did all they could for her but she preferred to hang around the old place and to do what she could with her mammy and old stephen her husband who alone remained in the quarters she lived in a part of the house locking up the rest and from time to time visited among her friends and relatives who always received her hospitably she had an old piece of a mare which i think she had bought from stephen with one eye three legs and no mane or tail to speak of and on which she lavished without the least perceptible result care enough to have kept a stable in condition in a freak of humor she named this animal fashion after a noted racer of the old times which had been raised in the county and had beaten the famous boston in a great race she always spoke of fash with a tone of real tenderness in her voice and looked after her and discussed her ailments which were always numerous as if she had been a delicate child mounted on this beast with her bags and bundles and shawls and umbrella and a long stick or pole she used occasionally to make the tour of the neighborhood and was always really welcomed because notwithstanding the trouble she gave she always stirred things up as was said once you could no more have remained dull where she was than you could have dozed with a down your back her retort was that a might be used to rouse people from a lethargy she had an old tongue by the younger members of the family she was always welcomed because she furnished so much fun she nearly always fetched some little thing to her host not her hostess a fowl or a pat of butter from her one old cow or something of the kind because she said abigail had established the precedent and she was a woman of good understanding she understood that feeding and flattery were the way to win men she would sometimes have a chicken in a basket hung on the off pummel of her old saddle because at times she fancied she could not eat anything but chicken soup and she did not wish to give trouble she used to give trouble enough for it generally turned out that she had heard some one was sick in the neighborhood and she wanted the soup carried to her i remember how mad joe got because she made him go with her to carry a bucket of soup to old mrs ronquist chapter ii i only six when wee brown elspeth was brought to me jean and angus were as fond of each other in their silent way as they were of me and they often went together with me when i was taken out for my walks i was kept in the open air a great deal and angus would walk by the side of my small shaggy shetland pony and lead him over rough or steep places sheltie the pony was meant for use when we wished to fare farther than a child could walk but i was trained to sturdy marching and climbing even from my babyhood because i so loved the moor we nearly always rambled there often we set out early in the morning and some simple food was carried so that we need not return to the castle until we chose i would ride sheltie and walk by turns until we found a place i liked then jean and angus would sit down among the heather sheltie would be secured and i would wander about and play in my own way i do not think it was in a strange way i think i must have played as almost any lonely little girl might have played i used to find a corner among the bushes and pretend it was my house and that i had little friends who came to play with me i only remember one thing which was not like the ordinary playing of children it was a habit i had of sitting quite still a long time and listening that was what i called it listening i was listening to hear if the life on the moor made any sound i could understand i felt as if it might if i were very still and listened long enough angus and jean and i were not afraid of rain and mist and change of weather if we had been we could have had little outdoor life we always carried plaids enough to keep us warm and dry so on this day i speak of we did not turn back when we found ourselves in the midst of a sudden mist we sat down in a sheltered place and waited knowing it would lift in time the sun had been shining when we set out angus and jean were content to sit and guard me while i amused myself they knew i would keep near them and run into no danger i was not an adventurous child i was in fact in a more than usually quiet mood that morning the quiet had come upon me when the mist had begun to creep about and inclose us i liked it i liked the sense of being shut in by the soft whiteness i had so often watched from my nursery window in the castle people might be walking about i said to angus when he lifted me from back we see them they might be walking nothing that would hurt ye bairnie he answered no they hurt me i said i had never been afraid that anything on the moor would hurt me i played very little that day the quiet and the mist held me still soon i sat down and began to listen after a while i knew that jean and angus were watching me but it did not disturb me they often watched me when they thought i did not know they were doing it i had sat listening for nearly half an hour when i heard the first muffled slow trampling of horses hoofs i knew what it was even before it drew near enough for me to be conscious of the other sounds the jingling of arms and chains and the creaking of leather one notices as troopers pass by armed and mounted men were coming toward me that was what the sounds meant but they seemed faint and distant though i knew they were really quite near jean and angus did not appear to hear them i knew that i only heard them because i had been listening out of the mist they rode a company of men wearing garments such as i had never seen before most of them were savage and uncouth and their clothes were disordered and stained as if with hard travel and fight i did not know or even ask myself why they did not frighten me but they did not suddenly i seemed to know that they were brave men and had been doing some brave hard thing here and there among them i caught sight of a broken and stained sword or a dirk with only a hilt left they were all pale but their wild faces were joyous and triumphant i saw it as they drew near the man who seemed their chieftain was a lean giant who was darker but under his darkness paler than the rest on his forehead was a queer scar he rode a black horse and before him he held close with his left arm a pretty little girl dressed in strange rich clothes the big hand was pressed against her breast as he held her but though it was a large hand it did not quite cover a stain on the embroideries of her dress her dress was brown and she had brown hair and soft brown eyes like a little the moment i saw her i loved her iii at carnival time in the sixth year of life at the hermitage a merry company of rich people men and women from a neighbouring town made up a after a meal of and wine the company consisted of two lawyers a wealthy landowner an officer and four ladies one lady was the wife another the wife of the landowner the third his sister a young girl and the fourth a divorcee beautiful rich and eccentric who amazed and shocked the town by her escapades the weather was excellent and the road smooth as a floor they drove some seven miles out of town and then stopped and consulted as to whether they should turn back or drive farther but where does this road lead to asked makovkina the beautiful divorcee to tambov eight miles from here replied one of the lawyers who was having a flirtation with her and then where then on to l past the monastery where that father sergius lives yes kasatsky the handsome hermit yes mesdames et messieurs let us drive on and see kasatsky we can stop at tambov and have something to eat but we get home never mind we will stay at well there is a very good hostelry at the monastery i stayed there when i was defending makhin no i shall spend the night at impossible even your omnipotence could not accomplish that impossible will you bet all right if you spend the night with him the stake shall be whatever you like a discretion but on your side too yes of course let us drive on vodka was handed to the drivers and the party got out a box of pies wine and sweets for themselves the ladies wrapped up in their white dogskins the drivers disputed as to whose troyka should go ahead and the youngest seating himself sideways with a dashing air swung his long knout and shouted to the horses the tinkled and the squeaked over the snow the sledge swayed hardly at all the with his tightly bound tail under his decorated breechband galloped smoothly and briskly the smooth road seemed to run rapidly backwards while the driver dashingly shook the reins one of the lawyers and the officer sitting opposite talked nonsense to neighbour but makovkina herself sat motionless and in thought tightly wrapped in her fur always the same and always nasty the same red shiny faces smelling of wine and cigars the same talk the same thoughts and always about the same things and they are all satisfied and confident that it should be so and will go on living like that till they die but i it bores me i want something that would upset it all and turn it upside down suppose it happened to us as to those people at saratov was it who kept on driving and froze to death what would our people do how would they behave basely for certain each for himself and i too should act badly but i at any rate have beauty they all know it and how about that monk is it possible that he has become indifferent to it no that is the one thing they all care for like that cadet last autumn what a fool he was ivan nikolaevich she said aloud what are your commands how old is he who kasatsky over forty i should think and does he receive all visitors yes everybody but not always cover up my feet not like that how clumsy you are no more more like that but you need not squeeze them so they came to the forest where the cell was makovkina got out of the sledge and told them to drive on they tried to dissuade her but she grew irritable and ordered them to go on when the sledges had gone she went up the path in her white dogskin coat the lawyer got out and stopped to watch her it was father sixth year as a recluse and he was now his life in solitude was hard not on account of the fasts and the prayers they were no hardship to him but on account of an inner conflict he had not at all anticipated the sources of that conflict were two doubts and the lust of the flesh and these two enemies always appeared together it seemed to him that they were two foes but in reality they were one and the same as soon as doubt was gone so was the lustful desire but thinking them to be two different fiends he fought them separately o my god my god thought he why dost thou not grant me faith there is lust of course even the saints had to fight that saint anthony and others but they had faith while i have moments hours and days when it is absent why does the whole world with all its delights exist if it is sinful and must be renounced why hast thou created this temptation temptation is it not rather a temptation that i wish to abandon all the joys of earth and prepare something for myself there where perhaps there is nothing and he became horrified and filled with disgust at himself vile creature and it is you who wish to become a saint he upbraided himself and he began to pray but as soon as he started to pray he saw himself vividly as he had been at the monastery in a majestic post in biretta and mantle and he shook his head no that is not right it is deception i may deceive others but not myself or god i am not a majestic man but a pitiable and ridiculous one and he threw back the folds of his cassock and smiled as he looked at his thin legs in their underclothing chapter madame haupt hebamme ran a sign swinging from a window over a saloon on the avenue at a side door was another sign with a hand pointing up a dingy flight of stairs jurgis went up them three at a time madame haupt was frying pork and onions and had her door half open to let out the smoke when he tried to knock upon it it swung open the rest of the way and he had a glimpse of her with a black bottle turned up to

each other she wore a filthy blue wrapper and her teeth were black vot is it she said when she saw jurgis he had run like mad all the way and was so out of breath he could hardly speak his hair was

chapter viii the last rehearsal was over a tedious dress rehearsal which had lasted all day and exhausted the patience of every one who had to do with it when hilda had dressed for the street and came out of her she found hugh macconnell waiting for her in the corridor the thicker than ever hilda there have been a great many accidents positively unsafe for you to be out alone will you let me take you home how good of you mac if you are going with me i think rather walk had no exercise and all this has made me nervous i wonder said macconnell dryly hilda pulled down her veil and they stepped out into the thick brown wash that submerged st lane macconnell took her hand and tucked it snugly under his arm sorry i was such a savage i hope you think i made an ass of myself not a bit of it i wonder you were peppery those things are awfully trying how do you think going magnificently why i got so stirred up we are going to hear from this both of us and that reminds me got news for you they are going to begin repairs on the theatre about the middle of march and we are to run over to new york for six weeks bennett told me yesterday that it was decided hilda looked up delightedly at the tall gray figure beside her he was the only thing she could see for they were moving through a dense opaqueness as if they were walking at the bottom of the ocean oh mac how glad i am and they love your things over there they shall you be glad for any other reason hilda macconnell put his hand in front of her to ward off some dark object it proved to be only a and they beat in farther from the edge of the pavement what do you mean mac hilda asked nervously i was just thinking there might be people over there be glad to see he brought out awkwardly hilda said nothing and as they walked on macconnell spoke again apologetically i hope you mind my knowing about it hilda stiffen up like that no one else knows and i try to find out anything i felt it even before i knew who he was i knew there was somebody and that it i they crossed oxford street in silence feeling their way the busses had stopped running and the were leading their horses when they reached the other side macconnell said suddenly i hope you are happy terribly dangerously happy mac hilda spoke quietly pressing the rough sleeve of his greatcoat with her gloved hand always thought me too old for you hilda oh of course never said just that and here this fellow is not more than eight years younger than i always felt that if i could get out of my old case i might win you yet a fine brave youth i carry inside me only never be seen nonsense mac that has nothing to do with it because you seem too close to me too much my own kind it would be like marrying cousin mike almost i really tried to care as you wanted me to away back in the beginning well here we are turning out of the square you are not angry with me hilda thank you for this walk my dear go in and get dry things on at once be having a great night she put out her hand thank you mac for everything macconnell trudged off through the fog and she went slowly upstairs her slippers and dressing gown were waiting for her before the fire i shall certainly see him in new york he will see by the papers that we are coming perhaps he knows it already hilda kept thinking as she undressed perhaps he will be at the dock no scarcely that but i may meet him in the street even before he comes to see me marie placed the by the fire and brought hilda her letters she looked them over and started as she came to one in a handwriting that she did not often see alexander had written to her only twice before and he did not allow her to write to him at all thank you marie you may go now hilda sat down by the table with the letter in her hand still unopened she looked at it intently turned it over and felt its thickness with her fingers she believed that she sometimes had a kind of about letters and could tell before she read them whether they brought good or evil tidings she put this one down on the table in front of her while she poured her tea at last with a little shiver of expectancy she tore open the envelope and read boston february my dear hilda it is after twelve every one else is in bed and i am sitting alone in my study i have been happier in this room than anywhere else in the world happiness like that makes one insolent i used to think these four walls could stand against anything and now i scarcely know myself here now i know that no one can build his security upon the nobleness of another person two people when they love each other grow alike in their tastes and habits and pride but their moral natures whatever we may mean by that canting expression are never welded the base one goes on being base and the noble one noble to the end william dean howells it is consoling as often as dismaying to find in what seems a cataclysmal tide of a certain direction a strong drift to the opposite quarter it is so divinable if not so perceptible that its presence may usually be recognized as a beginning of the turn in every tide which is sure sooner or later to come in reform it is the menace of reaction in reaction it is the promise of reform we may take heart as we must lose heart from it a few years ago when a movement which carried fiction to the highest place in literature was apparently of such onward and upward sweep that there could be no return or descent there was a in it which stayed it at last and pulled it back to that lamentable level where fiction is now sunk and the word novel is again the synonym of all that is morally false and mentally despicable yet that this too is partly apparent i think can be shown from some phases of actual fiction which happen to be its very latest phases and which are of a significance as hopeful as it is interesting quite as surely as romanticism lurked at the heart of realism something that we may call psychologism has been present in the romanticism of the last four or five years and has now begun to evolve itself in examples which it is the pleasure as well as the duty of criticism to deal with i no one in his day has done more to popularize the romanticism now decadent than mr gilbert parker and he made way for it at its worst just because he was so much better than it was at its worst because he was a poet of undeniable quality and because he could bring to its intellectual squalor the graces and the powers which charm though they could not avail to save it from final contempt he saves himself in his latest novel because though still so largely romanticistic its prevalent effect is psychologistic which is the finer analogue of realistic and which gave realism whatever was vital in it as now it gives romanticism whatever will survive it in the right of way mr parker is not in a world where mere determinism rules where there is nothing but the happening of things and where this one or that one is important or unimportant according as things are happening to him or not but has in himself no claim upon the reader's attention once more the novel begins to rise to its higher function and to teach that men are somehow masters of their fate his charley steele is indeed as unpromising material for the experiment in certain ways as could well be chosen one of the few memorable things that bulwer said who said so many quotable things was that pure intellectuality is the devil and on his plane charley steele comes near being pure intellectual he apprehends all things from the mind and does the effects even of goodness from the pride of mental strength add to these conditions of his personality that pathologically he is from time to time a drunkard with always the danger of remaining a drunkard and you have a figure of which so much may be despaired that it might almost be called hopeless i confess that in the beginning this brilliant pitiless lawyer this consciencelessly powerful advocate at once mocker and poseur all but failed to interest me a little of him and his monocle went such a great way with me that i thought i had enough of him by the end of the trial where he gets off a man charged with murder and then cruelly snubs the homicide in his gratitude and i do not quite know how i kept on to the point where steele in his drunkenness first dazzles and then insults the gang of drunken lumbermen and begins his second life in the river where they have thrown him and where his former client finds him from that point i could not forsake him to the end though i found myself more than once in the world where things happen of themselves and do not happen from the temperaments of its inhabitants in a better and wiser world the homicide would not perhaps be at hand so opportunely to save the life of the advocate who had saved his but one consents to this as one consents to a great deal besides in the story which is imaginably the survival of a former method the artist's affair is to report the appearance the effect and in the real world the appearance the effect is that of law and not of miracle nature employs the miracle so very sparingly that most of us go through life without seeing one and some of us contract such a prejudice against miracles that when they are performed for us we suspect a trick when i suffered from this suspicion in the right of way i was the more vexed because i felt that i was in the hands of a connoisseur of character who had no need of miracles rags are royal raiment when worn for virtue's sake i shall stop here and go down to the pantry i could eat no dinner being filled with emotion but i must keep strong if i am to help adrian in his trouble the mince pie was excellent but after all pastry does not take the place of solid food later i shall now go on with my recital as the theater was almost empty at the end of act one i put on the pink hat and left it on as though there was no one behind me and although during act one i had thought that he perhaps felt my presence he had not once looked directly at me but the hat captured his errant gaze as one may say and after capture it remained on my face so much so that i flushed and a woman sitting near with a very plain girl in a skunk collar observed really it is outrageous now came a moment which i thrill even to recollect for adrian plucked a pink rose from a vase he was in the millionaire's house and was starving in the midst of luxury and held it to his lips the rose not the house of course looking over it he smiled down at me later it is midnight i cannot sleep perchance he too is lying awake i am sitting at the window in my robe de nuit below mother and sis have just come in and smith has slammed the door of the car and gone back to the garage how puny is the life my family leads nothing but eating and playing with no higher thoughts a man has just gone by for a moment i thought i recognized the footstep but no it was but the night watchman january father still away no money as mother absolutely refuses on account of maddie mackenzie's gown which she had to send away to be repaired january father still away the hon sent sis a huge bunch of orchids today she refused me even one she is always tight with flowers and candy january the paper says that adrian's play is going to close the end of next week no business how can i endure to know that he is suffering and that i cannot help even to the extent of buying one ticket matinee today and no money father still away i have tried to do a kind deed today feeling that perhaps it would soften mother's heart and she would advance my allowance i offered to manicure her nails for her but she refused saying that as hannah had done it for many years she guessed she could manage now january today i did a desperate thing dear diary the desperate is the wisest course butler it is sunday i went to church and thought things over what a wonderful thing it would be if i could save the play why should i feel that my sex is a handicap the rector preached on the opportunities of women the sermon gave me courage to go on when he said women today step in where men are afraid to tread and bring success out of failure i felt that it was meant for me had no money for the plate and mother attempted to smuggle a half dollar to me i refused however as if i cannot give my own money to the heathen i will give none mother turned pale and the man with the plate gave me a black look what can he know of my reasons beresford lunched with us and as i discouraged him entirely he was very attentive to sis mother is planing a big wedding and i found sis in the store room yesterday looking up mother's wedding veil no old stuff for me i guess beresford is trying to forget that he kissed my hand the other night for he called me little miss barbara today meaning little in the sense of young i gave him a stern glance i am not any littler than the other night i observed that was merely an affectionate diminutive he said looking uncomfortable if you don't mind i said coldly you might do as you have heretofore reserve your affectionate advances until we are alone barbara mother said and began quickly to talk about a lady something or other we'd met on a train in switzerland because they can talk until they are black in the face dear diary but it is true we do not know any of the british nobility except the aforementioned and the man who comes once a year with flavoring extracts who says he is the third son of a baronet every one being out this afternoon i suddenly had an inspiration and sent for carter brooks i then put my hair up and put on my blue silk because while i do not believe in woman using her feminine charm when talking business i do believe that she should look her best under any and all circumstances he was rather surprised not to find sis in as i had used her name in telephoning i did it i explained because i knew that you felt no interest in me and i had to see you chapter seven it is dark here in the forest the leaves rustle over our head black against the last gold of the sky the moss is soft and warm we shall sleep on this moss for many nights till the beasts of the forest come to tear our body we have no bed now save the moss and no future save the beasts we are old now yet we were young this morning when we carried our glass box through the streets of the city to the home of the scholars no men stopped us for there were none about from the palace of corrective detention and the others knew nothing no men stopped us at the gate we walked through the empty passages and into the great hall where the world council of scholars sat in solemn meeting we saw nothing as we entered save the sky in the great windows blue and glowing then we saw the scholars who sat around a long table they were as shapeless clouds huddled at the rise of the a great sky there were the men whose famous names we knew and others from distant lands whose names we had not heard we saw a great painting on the wall over their heads of the twenty illustrious men who had invented the candle all the heads of the council turned to us as we entered these great and wise of the earth did not know what to think of us and they looked upon us with wonder and curiosity as if we were a miracle it is true that our tunic was torn and stained with brown stains which had been blood we raised our right arm and we said our greeting to you our honored brothers of the world council of scholars then collective the oldest and wisest of the council spoke and asked who are you our brother for you do not look like a scholar our name is equality equity we answered and we are a street sweeper of this city then is it was as if a great wind had stricken the hall for all the scholars spoke at once and they were angry and frightened a street sweeper a street sweeper walking in upon the world council of scholars it is not to be believed it is against all the rules and all the laws but we knew how to stop them our brothers we said we matter not nor our transgression it is only our brother men who matter give no thought to us for we are nothing but listen to our words for we bring you a gift such as had has never been brought to men listen to us for we hold the future of mankind in our hands then they listened we placed our glass box upon on the table before them we spoke of it and of our long quest and of our tunnel and of our escape from the palace of corrective detention not a hand moved in that hall as we spoke nor an eye then we put the wires to the box and they all bent forward and sat still watching and we stood still our eyes upon the wire and slowly slowly as a flush of blood a red flame trembled in the wire then the wire glowed but terror struck the men of the council they leapt to their feet they ran from the table and they stood pressed against the wall huddled together seeking the warmth of one another's bodies to give them courage we looked upon them and we laughed and said fear nothing our brothers there is a great power in these wires but this power is tamed it is yours we give it to you still they would not move we give you the power of the sky we cried we give you the key to the earth take it and let us be one of you the humblest among you let us all work together and harness this power and make it ease the toil of men let us throw away our candles and our torches let us flood our cities with light let us bring a new light to men but they looked upon us and suddenly we were afraid for their eyes were still and small and evil our brothers we cried have you nothing to say to us then collective moved forward they moved to the table and the others followed yes spoke collective we have much to say to you the sound of their voices voice brought silence to the hall and to be the beat of our heart yes said collective we have much to say to a wretch who have broken all the laws and who boast of their infamy how dared you think that your mind held greater wisdom that than the minds of your brothers and if the councils council had decreed that you should be a street sweeper how dared you think that you could be of greater use to men than in sweeping the streets how dared you gutter cleaner spoke fraternity to hold yourself as one alone and with the thoughts of the one and not of the many white roses in a as upon a world canopied with storm hung with mourning purple and habited in black did mr flitcroft turn his morning face at eight o'clock antemeridian monday as he hied himself to his daily duty at the washington national bank yet more than the merely funereal gloomed out from the hillocky area of his countenance was there not i'faith a glow a vesuvian shimmer beneath the murk of that darkling eye was here one think you to turn the other cheek little has he learned of norbert flitcroft who conceives that this fiery spirit was easily to be quenched look upon the jowl of him and let him who dares maintain that people even the very pikes themselves were to grind beneath their brougham wheels a prostrate norbert and ride on scatheless in this his own metaphor is nearly touched i guess not they don't run over me martin pike better look out how he tries it so mother nature at her kindly tasks good norbert uses for her unguent our own perfect inconsistency and often when we are stabbed deep in the breast she distracts us by thin scratches in other parts that in the itch of these we may forget the greater hurt till it be healed thus the remembrance of last night when you undisguisedly ran from the wrath of a pike with a pretty girl looking on to say nothing of the acrid arp who will fling the legend on a thousand winds might well agonize you now as in less hasty moments and at a safe distance you brood upon the piteous figure you cut on the contrary behold you see no blood crimsoning the edges of the horrid gash in your panoply of you but smart and scratch the scratches forgetting your wound in the hot itch for vengeance it is an itch which will last for in such matters your temper shall be steadfast and let the great goliath in the mean time beware of you you ran last night you ran of course you ran why not you ran to fight another day a bank clerk sometimes has opportunities the stricken fat one could not understand how it came about that he had blurted out the damning confession that he had visited beaver beach when he tried to solve the puzzle his mind refused the strain became foggy and the terrors of his position acute was he like joe louden to endure the ban of canaan and like him stand excommunicate beyond the pale because of martin pike's displeasure for norbert saw with perfect clearness what the judge had done for joe now that he stood in danger of a fate identical this came home to him how many others he wondered would do as mamie had done and write notes such as he had received by the hand of sam warden late last night dear sir this from mamie who in the canaanitish way had been wont to address him as norb my father wishes me to state that after your remark yesterday afternoon on the steps which was overheard by my mother who happened to be standing in the hall behind you and your behavior to himself later on he considers it impossible to allow you to call any more or to speak to any member of his household yours respectfully mamie pike erasures and restorations bore witness to a considerable doubt in mamie's mind concerning yours respectfully but she had finally let it stand evidently convinced that the plain signature without preface savored of an intimacy denied by the context dear sir repeated norbert between set teeth impossible to allow you to call any more these and other terms of his dismissal recurred to him during the morning and ever and anon he looked up from his desk his lips moving to the tune of those horrid phrases and stared out at the street basilisk glaring this with no christian softness in it not even when it fell upon his own grandfather sitting among the sages within easy from the big window at norbert's elbow however colonel flitcroft was not disturbed by the gaze of his descendant being in fact quite unaware of it the aged men were having a busy morning the conclave was not what it had been see arp and all his works there had come as the years went by a few recruits but faces were missing the two tabors had gone and uncle joe davey could no longer lay claim to the patriarchship he had laid it down with a and gone his way eskew himself was now the oldest of the conscript fathers the colonel and squire buckalew pressing him closely with peter bradbury no great time behind they did not plant their feet upon the brass rail inside the hotel windows but courted the genial weather and as their summer custom was tilted back their chairs in the shade of the western wall of the building and who could of dreamed mr bradbury was saying with a of expectancy at eskew that jonas tabor would ever turn out to have a niece like that mr arp ceased to fan himself with his wide straw hat and said grimly the wedding gown the gay belles of fashion may boast of excelling in waltz or cotillon at whist or quadrille and seek admiration by vauntingly telling of drawing and painting and musical skill but give me the fair one in country or city whose home and its duties are dear to her heart who cheerfully warbles some rustical ditty while plying the needle with exquisite art the bright little needle the needle the needle directed by beauty and art the next morning miss amelia finished the chapter that made two for our family father always read one before breakfast no wonder i knew the bible quite well then we sang a song and she made a stiff little prayer i had my doubts about her prayers she was on no such terms with the lord as my father he got right at him and talked like a doctor and you felt he had some influence and there was at least a possibility that he might get what he asked for but miss amelia prayed as if the lord were ten million miles away and she would be surprised to pieces if she got anything she wanted when she asked the almighty to make us good obedient children there was not a word she said that showed she trusted either the lord or us or thought there was anything between us and heaven that might make us good because we wanted to be you couldn't keep your eyes from the big gad and ruler on her desk she often fingered them as she prayed and you knew from her stiff little petition that her faith was in implements and she'd hit you a crack the minute she was the least angry same as she had me the day before i didn't feel any too good toward her but when the blood of the crusaders was in the veins right must be done even if it took a struggle i had to live up to those little gold shells on the trinket father said they knew i was coming down the line so they put on a bird for me but i told him i would be worthy of the shells too this took about as hard a fight for me as any crusade would for a big trained soldier i had been wrong laddie had made me see that so i held up my hand and miss amelia saw me as she picked up ray's arithmetic what is it i held to the desk to brace myself and tried twice before i could raise my voice so that she heard please miss amelia i said i was wrong about the birds yesterday not that they don't fight they do but i was wrong to contradict you before every one and on your first day and if you'll only excuse me the next time you make a mistake i'll tell you after school or at recess the room was so still you could hear the others breathing miss amelia picked up the ruler and started toward me possibly i raised my hands that would be no crusader way but you might do it before you had time to think when the ruler was big and your head was the only place that would be hit the last glimpse i had of her in the midst of all my trouble made me think of sabethany perkins sabethany died and they buried her at the foot of the hill in our graveyard before i could remember but her people thought heaps of her and spent much money on the biggest tombstone in the cemetery and planted pinies and purple phlox on her and went every sunday to visit her when they moved away they missed her so they decided to come back and take her along the men were at work and leon and i went to see what was going on they told us and said we had better go away because possibly things might happen that children would sleep better not to see strange how a thing like that makes you bound you will see we went and sat on the fence and waited soon they reached sabethany but they could not seem to get her out they tried and tried and at last they sent for more men it took nine of them to bring her to the surface what little wood was left they laid back to see what made her so fearfully heavy and there she was turned to solid stone they couldn't chip a piece off her with the shovel mother always said for goodness sake don't let your mouth hang open and as a rule we kept ours shut but you should have seen leon's when he saw sabethany wouldn't chip off and no doubt mine was as bad when gabriel blows his trumpet and the dead arise and come forth what on earth will they do with sabethany i gasped why she couldn't fly to heaven with wings a mile wide and what use could they make of her if she got there i can't see a thing she'd be good for except a hitching post said leon and i guess they don't let horses in let's go home chapter i it was four in the morning when george dupont closed the door and came down the steps to the street the first faint streaks of dawn were in the sky and he noticed this with annoyance because he knew that his hair was in disarray and his whole aspect disorderly yet he dared not take a cab because he feared to attract attention at home when he reached the sidewalk he glanced about him to make sure that no one had seen him leave the house then started down the street his eyes upon the sidewalk before him george had the feeling of the morning after there are few men in this world of abundant sin who will not know what the phrase means the fumes of the night had evaporated he was quite sober now quite free from excitement he saw what he had done and it seemed to him something black and disgusting never had a walk seemed longer than the few blocks which he had to traverse to reach his home he must get there before the maid was up before the boy called with the rolls otherwise what explanation could he give he who had always been such a moral man who had been pointed out by mothers as an example to their sons george thought of his own mother and what she would think if she could know about his adventure he thought again and again with a pang of anguish of henriette could it be possible that a man who was engaged whose marriage contract had actually been signed who was soon to possess the love of a beautiful and noble girl that such a man could have been weak enough and base enough to let himself be trapped into such a low action he went back over the whole series of events shuddering at them trying to realize how they had happened trying to excuse himself for them he had not intended such a culmination he had never meant to do such a thing in his life he had not thought of any harm when he had accepted the invitation to the supper party with his old companions from the law school of course he had known that several of these chums led fast lives but then surely a fellow could go to a rooms for a lark without harm he remembered the girl who had sat by his side at the table she had come with a friend who was a married woman and so he had assumed that she was all right george remembered how embarrassed he had been when first he had noticed her glances at him but then the wine had begun to go to his head he was one of those unfortunate wretches who cannot drink wine at all he had offered to take the girl home in a cab and on the way he had lost his head oh what a wretched thing it was he could hardly believe that it was he who had spoken those frenzied words and yet he must have spoken them because he remembered them he remembered that it had taken a long time to persuade her he had had to promise her a ring like the one her married friend wore before they entered her home she had made him take off his shoes so that the porter might not hear them this had struck george particularly because even flushed with excitement as he was he had not forgotten the warnings his father had given him as to the dangers of contact with strange women he had thought to himself this girl must be safe it is probably the first time she has ever done such a thing but now george could get but little consolation out of that idea he was suffering intensely the emotion described by the poet in the bitter words about moving finger having writ his mind seeking some explanation some justification went back to the events before that night with a sudden pang of yearning he thought of lizette she was a decent girl and had kept him decent and he was lonely without her he had been so afraid of being found out that he had given her up when he became engaged but now for a while he felt that he would have to break his resolution and pay his regular sunday visit to the little flat in the portion of paris it was while george was fitting himself for the same career as his father that of notary that he had made the acquaintance of the young working girl it may not be easy to believe but lizette had really been a decent girl she had a family to take care of and was in need there was a grandmother in poor health a father not much better and three little brothers so lizette did not very long resist george dupont and he felt quite virtuous in giving her sufficient money to take care of these unfortunate people among people of his class it was considered proper to take such things if one paid for them all the family of this working girl were grateful to him they adored him and they called him uncle raoul for of course he had not been so foolish as to give them his true name henry jekyll's full statement of the case i was born in the year to a large fortune endowed besides with excellent parts inclined by nature to industry fond of the respect of the wise and good among my and thus as might have been supposed with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished future and indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient gaiety of disposition such as has made the happiness of many but such as i found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my head high and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public hence it came about that i concealed my pleasures and that when i reached years of reflection and began to look round me and take stock of my progress and position in the world i stood already committed to a profound duplicity of life many a man would have even blazoned such irregularities as i was guilty of but from the high views that i had set before me i regarded and hid them with an almost morbid sense of shame it was thus rather the exacting nature of my aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults that made me what i was and with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound man's dual nature in this case i was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that hard law of life which lies at the root of religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress though so profound a i was in no sense a hypocrite both sides of me were in dead earnest i was no more myself when i laid aside restraint and plunged in shame than when i laboured in the eye of day at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering and it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies which led wholly toward the mystic and the transcendental and shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my members with every day and from both sides of my intelligence the moral and the intellectual i thus drew steadily nearer to that truth by whose partial discovery i have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck that man is not truly one but truly two i say two because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point others will follow others will outstrip me on the same lines and i hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious incongruous and independent denizens i for my part from the nature of my life advanced infallibly in one direction and in one direction only it was on the moral side and in my own person that i learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man i saw that of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness even if i could rightly be said to be either it was only because i was radically both and from an early date even before the course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most naked possibility of such a miracle i had learned to dwell with pleasure as a beloved on the thought of the separation of these elements if each i told myself could but be housed in separate identities life would be relieved of all that was unbearable the unjust delivered from the aspirations might go his way and remorse of his more upright twin and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path doing the good things in which he found his pleasure and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil it was the curse of mankind that these incongruous fagots were thus bound together that in the agonised womb of consciousness these polar twins should be continuously struggling how then were they dissociated i was so far in my reflections when as i have said a began to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table i began to perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated the trembling immateriality the transience of this seemingly so solid body in which we walk attired certain agents i found to have the power to shake and to pluck back that fleshly vestment even as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion for two good reasons i will not enter deeply into this scientific branch of my confession first because i have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound for ever on man's shoulders and when the attempt is made to cast it off it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure second because as my narrative will make alas too evident my discoveries were incomplete enough then that i not only recognised my natural body for the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the powers that made up my spirit but managed to compound a drug by which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy and a second form and countenance substituted none the less natural to me because they were the expression and bore the stamp of lower elements in my soul chapter ii good indian there is a saying and if it is not purely western it is at least purely american that the only good indian is a dead indian in the very teeth of that and in spite of the fact that he was neither very good nor an indian nor in any sense dead men called grant imsen good indian to his face and if he resented the title his resentment was never made manifest perhaps because he had grown up with the name he rather liked it when he was a little fellow and with custom had come to take it as a matter of course because his paternal ancestry went back and back to no one knows where among the race of blue eyes and fair skin the indians repudiated relationship with him and called him white man though they also spoke of him unthinkingly as good injun because old wolfbelly himself would grudgingly admit under pressure that the mother of grant had been the daughter of wolfbelly's sister white men remembered the taint when they were angry and called him injun and because he stood thus between the two races of men his exact social status a subject always open to argument not even the fact that he was looked upon by the harts as one of the family with his own bed always ready for him in a corner of the big room set apart for the boys and with a certain place at the table which was called his not even his assured position there could keep him from sometimes feeling quite alone and perhaps a trifle bitter over his loneliness phoebe hart had mothered him from the time when his father had sickened and died in her house leaving grant there with twelve years behind him in his hands a dirty canvas bag of gold coin so heavy he could scarce lift it which stood for the mining claim the old man had just sold and the command to invest every one of the gold coins in schooling old john imsen was steeped in knowledge of the open nothing of the great outdoors had ever slipped past him and remained mysterious put when he sold his last claim others he had which promised little and so did not count he had signed his name with an x another had written the word john before that x and the word imsen after above a word which he explained was his and below the word mark john imsen had stared down suspiciously at the words and he had not felt quite easy in his mind until the bag of gold coins was actually in his keeping also he had been ashamed of that x it was a simple thing to make with a pen and yet he had only succeeded in making it look like two crooked sticks thrown down carelessly one upon the other his face had gone darkly red with the shame of it and he had stood scowling down at the paper that boy uh mine's goin to do better n that by god he had sworn and the words had sounded like a vow when two months after that he had faced incredulously as is the way with strong men the fact that for him life was over with nothing left to him save an hour or so of labored breath and a few muttered sentences he did not forget that vow he called phoebe close to the bed placed the bag of gold in grant's trembling hands and stared intently from one face to the other mis hart he ain't got anybody my folks i lost track of em years ago you see to it git some learnin in his head when a man knows books it's like bein heeled good gun plenty uh in a fight when i got that gold it was like fightin with my bare hands against a gatlin gun they coulda cheated me whole thing on paper i wouldn't know luck just luck they didn't so you take it and git the boy schoolin costs money i know that git him all it'll buy send him where they keep the best don't yuh let up n'er let him whilst they's a dollar left put it all into his head then he can't lose it and he can make it earn more i guess i needn't ask yuh be good to him he ain't got anybody not a soul injuns don't count you see to it don't let up till it's all gone phoebe had taken him literally and grant if he had little taste for the task had learned books and other things not mentioned in the curriculums of the schools she sent him to and when the bag was reported by phoebe to be empty he had returned with inward relief to the desultory life of the hart ranch and its immediate vicinity his father would probably have been amazed to see how little difference that schooling made in the boy the money had lasted long enough to take him through a preparatory school and into the second year of a college and the only result apparent was speech a shade less slipshod than that of his fellows and a vocabulary which permitted him to indulge in an amazing number of epithets and in colorful vituperation when the fancy seized him he rode hot and thirsty and tired from sage hill one day and found hartley empty of interest hot as the trail he had just now left thankfully behind him and so absolutely sleepy that it seemed likely to sink into the earth under the weight of its own dullness even the whisky was so warm it burned like fire and the beer he tried left upon his outraged palate the unhappy memory of insipid warmth and great bitterness plaerdemavida by the great mercy of god plaerdemavida was saved from the shipwreck and taken to the city of tunis to the house of a fisherman's daughter as was related previously then after two years had passed the fisherman's daughter took a husband near that city and while they held plaerdemavida captive there she always lived very honestly working gold and silk as the maidens of greece are accustomed to doing it happened one day that her mistress went to the city of montagata and left plaerdemavida to watch the house she had gone to the city to make some purchases and while she was there she went to talk to the king's daughter and she told her my lady i've been told that you are planning to marry and that you are supplying yourself with blouses embroidered with gold and silk and other things proper for maidens i have a young slave who is able to do what i have taught her from the time she was an infant to embroider all manner of things as befits young women here are some samples of what she can do if you want her i will give her to you for one hundred doubloons even though i will be losing all the training i have given her the princess seeing the samples wanted her very much and she said that she would be happy to give her the one hundred doubloons the moor said i'll be glad to give her to you for that price on one condition you must tell her that i have loaned her to you for two months because if she guessed that i had sold her she would be so sad that she would fall into despair plaerdemavida was placed in her hands and she came to love the princess very much it happened a short time later that the city was attacked and the moors took many christians prisoner among the men they captured was a soldier who had been an oarsman on tirant's galley when it was lost plaerdemavida recognized him and she said aren't you one of the christians who were on tirant's galley when it went down at sea my lady said the man it's true i was there and i nearly drowned i reached the shore half dead and afterward i was beaten and bought and sold i went through great trials in those days what can you tell me about tirant said plaerdemavida where did he die by the virgin mary said the prisoner he is very much alive he's right here he's the commander and he's using all his might to conquer this land he also told her that lord agramunt was wounded and then she asked him what became of plaerdemavida that maiden you're asking about said the prisoner it's believed that she died in the sea and our captain has grieved deeply over her when she heard the news she ordered all the prisoners to flee hearing that tirant was alive and so near she also wanted very much to escape but considering how tirant had conquered so much of the barbary coast and thinking of the victories that were told about the christian captain she was very happy for she had known nothing about him and believed that he had drowned in the sea she fell to her knees raised her clasped hands to heaven and gave thanks and praise to god our lord for the great success he had given to tirant and to the new christianity for he was making war on the enemies of jesus christ so bravely she became very hopeful that soon she would be out of captivity and all the suffering she had gone through up to then seemed to be nothing to her the thought that she would see tirant consoled her that much on the day her mistress had to go and talk to the captains she disguised herself so well that no one would recognize her when the lady was before the captain she was accompanied by fifty maidens but tirant would not listen to her and he sent her to his cousin lord agramunt and if he had replied badly to the ambassadors he gave an even worse reply to the lady hopeless they went back crying and lamenting loudly all that night men as well as women did not cease their wailing and sighing in the morning plaerdemavida told her mistress and the honorable men of the city that if they would give her liberty to go out she would talk to the captain and would tell him such things that he would do anything she wished they agreed that she should go because they had lost all hope and had only that one day left that day plaerdemavida dressed as a moor and painted her eyes so that she would not be recognized she took thirty well dressed maidens with her at noon they left the city and went to the camp and there they saw tirant at the door of his tent when he saw them coming he sent word that they should go to lord agramunt and that he could do nothing since he had turned all his power over to him plaerdemavida answered tell the captain that he should not refuse to see us and even less to speak to us because if that captain did such a thing he would be cruel and unjust since he is a knight and we are maidens in accordance with the order of chivalry he must aid us and give us his advice and his support the braided man of pyramid mountain the mountain before them was shaped like a cone and was so tall that its point was lost in the clouds directly facing the place where jim had stopped was an arched opening leading to a broad stairway the stairs were cut in the rock inside the mountain and they were broad and not very steep because they circled around like a and at the arched opening where the flight began the circle was quite big at the foot of the stairs was a sign reading warning these steps lead to the land of the gargoyles danger keep out i wonder how jim is ever going to draw the buggy up so many stairs said dorothy gravely no trouble at all declared the horse with a contemptuous neigh still i don't care to drag any passengers you'll all have to walk suppose the stairs get steeper suggested zeb doubtfully then you'll have to boost the that's all answered jim we'll try it anyway said the wizard it's the only way to get out of the valley of voe so they began to ascend the stairs dorothy and the wizard first jim next drawing the buggy and then zeb to watch that nothing happened to the harness the light was dim and soon they mounted into total darkness so that the wizard was obliged to get out his lanterns to light the way but this enabled them to proceed steadily until they came to a landing where there was a rift in the side of the mountain that let in both light and air looking through this opening they could see the valley of voe lying far below them the cottages seeming like toy houses from that distance after resting a few moments they resumed their climb and still the stairs were broad and low enough for jim to draw the buggy easily after him the old horse panted a little and had to stop often to get his breath at such times they were all glad to wait for him for continually climbing up stairs is sure to make one's legs ache they wound about always going upward for some time the lights from the lanterns dimly showed the way but it was a gloomy journey and they were pleased when a broad streak of light ahead assured them they were coming to a second landing here one side of the mountain had a great hole in it like the mouth of a cavern and the stairs stopped at the near edge of the floor and commenced ascending again at the opposite edge the opening in the mountain was on the side opposite to the valley of voe and our travellers looked out upon a strange scene below them was a vast space at the bottom of which was a black sea with rolling billows through which little tongues of flame constantly shot up just above them and almost on a level with their platform were banks of rolling clouds which constantly shifted position and changed color the blues and greys were very beautiful and dorothy noticed that on the cloud banks sat or reclined fleecy shadowy forms of beautiful beings who must have been the cloud fairies mortals who stand upon the earth and look up at the sky cannot often distinguish these forms but our friends were now so near to the clouds that they observed the dainty fairies very clearly are they real asked zeb in an awed voice of course replied dorothy softly they are the cloud fairies they seem like remarked the boy gazing intently if i should squeeze one there wouldn't be anything left of it in the open space between the clouds and the black bubbling sea far beneath could be seen an occasional strange bird winging its way swiftly through the air these birds were of enormous size and reminded zeb of the rocs he had read about in the arabian nights they had fierce eyes and sharp talons and beaks and the children hoped none of them would venture into the cavern well i declare suddenly exclaimed the little wizard what in the world is this they turned around and found a man standing on the floor in the center of the cave who bowed very politely when he saw he had attracted their attention he was a very old man bent nearly double but the queerest thing about him was his white hair and beard these were so long that they reached to his feet and both the hair and the beard were carefully plaited into many braids and the end of each braid fastened with a bow of colored ribbon where did you come from asked dorothy wonderingly no place at all answered the man with the braids that is not recently once i lived on top the earth but for many years i have had my factory in this spot half way up pyramid mountain are we only half way up enquired the boy in a discouraged tone i believe so my lad replied the braided man but as i have never been in either direction down or up since i arrived i cannot be positive whether it is exactly half way or not the atheist's mass bianchon a physician to whom science owes a fine system of theoretical physiology and who while still young made himself a celebrity in the medical school of paris that central luminary to which european doctors do homage practised surgery for a long time before he took up medicine his earliest studies were guided by one of the greatest of french surgeons the illustrious desplein who flashed across science like a meteor by the consensus even of his enemies he took with him to the tomb an incommunicable method like all men of genius he had no heirs he carried everything in him and carried it away with him the glory of a surgeon is like that of an actor they live only so long as they are alive and their talent leaves no trace when they are gone actors and surgeons like great singers too like the executants who by their performance increase the power of music tenfold are all the heroes of a moment desplein is a case in proof of this resemblance in the destinies of such transient genius his name yesterday so famous almost forgotten will survive in his special department without crossing its limits for must there not be some extraordinary circumstances to exalt the name of a professor from the history of science to the general history of the human race had desplein that universal command of knowledge which makes a man the living word the great figure of his age desplein had a godlike eye he saw into the sufferer and his malady by an intuition natural or acquired which enabled him to grasp the diagnostics peculiar to the individual to determine the very time the hour the minute when an operation should be performed making due allowance for atmospheric conditions and peculiarities of individual temperament to proceed thus hand in hand with nature had he then studied the constant assimilation by living beings of the elements contained in the atmosphere or yielded by the earth to man who absorbs them deriving from them a particular expression of life did he work it all out by the power of deduction and analogy to which we owe the genius of cuvier be this as it may this man was in all the secrets of the human frame he knew it in the past and in the future emphasizing the present but did he epitomize all science in his own person as hippocrates did and galen and aristotle did he guide a whole school towards new worlds no though it is impossible to deny that this persistent observer of human chemistry possessed that antique science of the mages that is to say knowledge of the elements in fusion the causes of life life antecedent to life and what it must be in its incubation or ever it is it must be confessed that unfortunately everything in him was purely personal isolated during his life by his egoism that egoism is now suicidal of his glory on his tomb there is no proclaiming statue to repeat to posterity the mysteries which genius seeks out at its own cost but perhaps desplein's genius was answerable for his beliefs and for that reason mortal to him the terrestrial atmosphere was a generative envelope he saw the earth as an egg within its shell and not being able to determine whether the egg or the hen first was he would not recognize either the cock or the egg he believed neither in the antecedent animal nor the surviving spirit of man desplein had no doubts he was positive his bold and unqualified atheism was like that of many scientific men the best men in the world but invincible atheists atheists such as religious people declare to be impossible this opinion could scarcely exist otherwise in a man who was accustomed from his youth to dissect the creature above all others before during and after life to hunt through all his organs without ever finding the individual soul which is indispensable to religious theory when he detected a cerebral centre a nervous centre and a centre for aerating the blood the first two so perfectly complementary that in the latter years of his life he came to a conviction that the sense of hearing is not absolutely necessary for hearing nor the sense of sight for seeing and that the solar plexus could supply their place without any possibility of doubt desplein thus finding two souls in man confirmed his atheism by this fact though it is no evidence against god this man died it is said in final impenitence as do unfortunately many noble geniuses whom god may forgive the life of this man great as he was was marred by many meannesses to use the expression employed by his enemies who were anxious to diminish his glory but which it would be more proper to call apparent contradictions envious people and fools having no knowledge of the determinations by which superior spirits are moved seize at once on superficial inconsistencies to formulate an accusation and so to pass sentence on them if subsequently the proceedings thus attacked are crowned with success showing the correlations of the preliminaries and the results a few of the vanguard of calumnies always survive in our day for instance napoleon was condemned by our contemporaries when he spread his eagle's wings to alight in england only could explain and the flatboats at boulogne chapter when bradley went on guard at midnight september his thoughts were largely occupied with rejoicing that the night was almost spent without serious mishap and that the morrow would doubtless see them all safely returned to fort dinosaur the hopefulness of his mood was tinged with sorrow by recollection of the two members of his party who lay back there in the savage wilderness and for whom there would never again be a homecoming no premonition of impending ill cast gloom over his anticipations for the coming day for bradley was a man who while taking every precaution against possible danger permitted no gloomy forebodings to weigh down his spirit when danger threatened he was prepared but he was not forever courting disaster and so it was that when about one o'clock in the morning of the fifteenth he heard the dismal flapping of giant wings overhead he was neither surprised nor frightened but idly prepared for an attack he had known might reasonably be expected the sound seemed to come from the south and presently low above the trees in that direction the man made out a dim shadowy form circling slowly about bradley was a brave man yet so keen was the feeling of revulsion engendered by the sight and sound of that grim uncanny shape that he distinctly felt the gooseflesh rise over the surface of his body and it was with difficulty that he refrained from following an instinctive urge to fire upon the nocturnal intruder better far better would it have been had he given in to the insistent demand of his subconscious mentor but his almost fanatical obsession to save ammunition proved now his undoing for while his attention was riveted upon the thing circling before him and while his ears were filled with the beating of its wings there swooped silently out of the black night behind him another weird and ghostly shape with its huge wings partly closed for the dive and its white robe fluttering in its wake the apparition swooped down upon the englishman so great was the force of the impact when the thing struck bradley between the shoulders that the man was half stunned his rifle flew from his grasp he felt clawlike talons of great strength seize him beneath his arms and sweep him off his feet and then the thing rose swiftly with him so swiftly that his cap was blown from his head by the rush of air as he was borne rapidly upward into the inky sky and the cry of warning to his companions was forced back into his lungs the creature wheeled immediately toward the east and was at once joined by its fellow who circled them once and then fell in behind them bradley now realized the strategy that the pair had used to capture him and at once concluded that he was in the power of reasoning beings closely related to the human race if not actually of it past experience suggested that the great wings were a part of some ingenious mechanical device for the limitations of the human mind which is always loath to accept aught beyond its own little experience would not permit him to entertain the idea that the creatures might be naturally winged and at the same time of human origin from his position bradley could not see the wings of his captor nor in the darkness had he been able to examine those of the second creature closely when it circled before him he listened for the puff of a motor or some other telltale sound that would prove the correctness of his theory however he was rewarded with nothing more than the constant presently far below and ahead he saw the waters of the inland sea and a moment later he was borne over them then his captor did that which proved beyond doubt to bradley that he was in the hands of human beings who had devised an almost perfect scheme of duplicating mechanically the wings of a bird the thing spoke to its companion and in a language that bradley partially understood since he recognized words that he had learned from the savage races of caspak from this he judged that they were human and being human he knew that they could have no natural wings for who had ever seen a human being so adorned therefore their wings must be mechanical thus bradley reasoned thus most of us reason not by what might be possible but by what has fallen within the range of our experience what he heard them say was to the effect that having covered half the distance the burden would now be transferred from one to the other bradley wondered how the exchange was to be accomplished he knew that those giant wings would not permit the creatures to approach one another closely enough to effect the transfer in this manner but he was soon to discover that they had other means of doing it he felt the thing that carried him rise to a greater altitude and below he glimpsed momentarily the second figure then the creature above sounded a low call it was answered from below and instantly bradley felt the clutching talons release him gasping for breath he hurtled downward through space chapter by the time mrs stogbuchner came out to the playground to call her class baartock had almost forgotten how hungry he was he had found jason and they had raced four times and baartock had won three times then several other boys had joined in and they'd played tag that was a whole new game for baartock he liked being it then he could do the chasing when he was not it he could run faster than any of the other boys so they didn't try to chase him at all they went back into the classroom and all the children went to their seats and got out their pencil boxes baartock was horrified to discover that his pencil box was missing it wasn't on the table where he'd left it it wasn't in the drawer at his place at the table it was his pencil box and he hadn't even used the crayons yet and now it was gone he didn't see it anywhere hello you must be baartock he looked around to see an adult standing right behind him i'm mrs pangle timmy's mother she pointed at one of the boys at the next table i come in two afternoons a week i'm the aide for this class baartock might have asked what an aide was but he was worried about his pencil box if you're looking for your box i put it in your cubby where cubby he didn't know that he had a cubby but if that was where his box was he wanted to find it it's right over here mrs pangle led him to the back of the room and stopped near the door going outside here you are she said pointing this is your cubby there just as she had said was his missing pencil box he picked it up and held it almost afraid that he might lose it again my cubby he asked that's right see right here baartock at the top of his cubby was a little card with marks on it he thought they looked like the marks mrs jackson had made on his pencil box he looked at his box the marks were just the same i fixed it for you while you were at lunch he remembered what mrs jackson said that humans say when only one gives something thank you he said you're welcome baartock you shouldn't leave your things on the table unless mrs stogbuchner tells you to it makes the room messy and you might lose something either put them in here or in your drawer in the table he didn't to tell her that he wasn't going to lose his box again he held on to it tightly and over here is where you can hang a coat mrs pangle said pointing to some hooks in the wall this one is yours there were cards over each hook and there was a mark on one that he recognized that must be his hook you'd better get back to your seat now but i'll be here if you need help he went back to the table and found that someone had given him some sheets of paper with marks all over them they didn't look like the ones he and jason had used the crayons on before and they weren't it's a writing worksheet jason said you're supposed to make letters on the lines that look just like the ones they've made baartock looked at the papers then opened his box and got out his crayons no you're supposed to use your pencil jason said seeing what baartock was holding baartock looked around and saw than none of them were using crayons he had wanted to make colored marks but they were all using long yellow sticks instead he hadn't used one of those before he put away his box of crayons and got out his yellow stick he tried to use his the way all the children were but it wouldn't make any marks on the paper the girl sitting across the table started giggling she had been watching him you have to sharpen it she said the pencil sharpener is on mrs stogbuchner's desk baartock got up and walked up to the desk he looked all over the desk but he didn't see anything to sharpen the stick with there wasn't a knife or any kind of blade was helping a girl at one table and mississpangel was helping a boy in the back of the classroom he just stood there looking at the desk and waited yes baartock what do you need mrs stogbuchner had finished with the girl and saw him just standing at her desk baartock wasn't sure just what to say so he held up the pencil instead do you need some help with the pencil sharpener she asked several children in the front of the class started snickering all right get back to your work she said to them as she came over to help him this is the pencil sharpener she said and taking the pencil from his hand and this is how to use it she put the pencil in a hole in a little box and started working the little crank on the side she pulled the pencil out of the box and it had a point that's how you do it you don't want to sharpen it too much or you'd grind it all away is that all you need the order of the procession was as follows montmorency carrying a stick two curs friends of george carrying coats and rugs and smoking a short pipe harris trying to walk with easy grace while carrying a gladstone bag in one hand and a bottle of in the other boy and boy with baskets boots from the hotel carrying hamper boy with basket boy with basket dog boy with basket odd man carrying a bag bosom companion of odd man with his hands in his pockets smoking a short clay boy with basket myself carrying three hats and a pair of boots and trying to look as if i know it six small boys and four stray dogs when we got down to the the boatman said let me see sir was yours a or a picture the bring of the provisions on our informing him it was a skiff he seemed surprised we had a good deal of trouble with steam launches that morning it was just before the henley week and they were going up in large numbers some by themselves some towing houseboats i do hate steam launches i suppose every rowing man does i never see a steam launch but i feel i should like to lure it to a lonely part of the river and there in the silence and the solitude strangle it there is a blatant bumptiousness about a steam launch that has the knack of rousing every evil instinct in my nature and i yearn for the good old days when you could go about and tell people what you thought of them with a hatchet and a bow and arrows the expression on the face of the man who with his hands in his pockets stands by the stern smoking a cigar is sufficient to excuse a breach of the peace by itself and the lordly whistle for you to get out of the way would i am confident ensure a verdict of justifiable homicide from any jury of river men they used to have to whistle for us to get out of their way if i may do so without appearing boastful i think i can honestly say that our one small boat during that week caused more annoyance and delay and aggravation to the steam launches that we came across than all the other craft on the river put together steam launch coming one of us would cry out on sighting the enemy in the distance and in an instant everything was got ready to receive her i would take the lines and harris and george would sit down beside me all of us with our backs to the launch and the boat would drift out quietly into on would come the launch whistling and on we would go drifting at about a hundred yards off she would start whistling like mad and the people would come and lean over the side and roar at us but we never heard them harris would be telling us an anecdote about his mother and george and i would not have missed a word of it for worlds then that launch would give one final shriek of a whistle that would nearly burst the boiler and she would reverse her engines and blow off steam and swing round and get aground everyone on board of it would rush to the bow and yell at us and the people on the bank would stand and shout to us and all the other passing boats would stop and join in till the whole river for miles up and down was in a state of frantic commotion and then harris would break off in the most interesting part of his narrative and look up with mild surprise and say to george why george bless me if here a steam launch and george would answer well do you know i thought i heard something upon which we would get nervous and confused and not know how to get the boat out of the way and the people in the launch would crowd round and instruct us pull your right you you idiot back with your left no not you the other one leave the lines alone you now both together not that way oh you then they would lower a boat and come to our assistance and after quarter of an effort would get us clean out of their way so that they could go on and we would thank them so much and ask them to give us a tow but they never would another good way we discovered of irritating the aristocratic type of steam launch was to mistake them for a beanfeast and ask them if they were messrs lot or the bermondsey good templars and could they lend us a saucepan old ladies not accustomed to the river are always intensely nervous of steam launches i remember going up once from staines to windsor a stretch of water peculiarly rich in these mechanical monstrosities with a party containing three ladies of this description it was very exciting at the first glimpse of every steam launch that came in view they insisted on landing and sitting down on the bank until it was out of sight again they said they were very sorry but that they owed it to their families not to be old esther dudley our host having resumed the chair he as well as mr tiffany and myself expressed much eagerness to be made acquainted with the story to which the loyalist had alluded that venerable man first of all saw fit to moisten his throat with another glass of wine and then turning his face towards our coal fire looked steadfastly for a few moments into the depths of its cheerful glow finally he poured forth a great fluency of speech the generous liquid that he had imbibed while it warmed his blood likewise took off the chill from his heart and mind and gave him an energy to think and feel which we could hardly have expected to find beneath the snows of fourscore winters his feelings indeed appeared to me more excitable than those of a younger man or at least the same degree of feeling manifested itself by more visible effects than if his judgment and will had possessed the potency of meridian life at the pathetic passages of his narrative he readily melted into tears when a breath of indignation swept across his spirit the blood flushed his withered visage even to the roots of his white hair and he shook his clinched fist at the trio of peaceful auditors seeming to fancy enemies in those who felt very kindly towards the desolate old soul but ever and anon sometimes in the midst of his most earnest talk this ancient person's intellect would wander vaguely losing its hold of the matter in hand and groping for it amid misty shadows then would he cackle forth a feeble laugh and express a doubt whether his wits for by that phrase it pleased our ancient friend to signify his mental powers were not getting a little the worse for wear under these disadvantages the old loyalist's story required more revision to render it fit for the public eye than those of the series which have preceded it nor should it be concealed that the sentiment and tone of the affair may have undergone some slight or perchance more than slight metamorphosis in its transmission to the reader through the medium of a democrat the tale itself is a mere sketch with no involution of plot nor any great interest of events yet possessing if i have rehearsed it aright that pensive influence over the mind which the shadow of the old province house flings upon the loiterer in its the hour had come the hour of defeat and humiliation when sir william howe was to pass over the threshold of the province house and embark with no such triumphal ceremonies as he once promised himself on board the british fleet he bade his servants and military attendants go before him and lingered a moment in the loneliness of the mansion to quell the fierce emotions that struggled in his bosom as with a death throb preferable then would he have deemed his fate had a warrior's death left him a claim to the narrow territory of a grave within the soil which the king had given him to defend with an ominous perception that as his departing footsteps echoed adown the staircase the sway of britain was passing forever from new england he smote his clinched hand on his brow and cursed the destiny that had flung the shame of a dismembered empire upon him would to god cried he hardly repressing his tears of rage that the rebels were even now at the doorstep a upon the floor should then bear testimony that the last british ruler was faithful to his trust the tremulous voice of a woman replied to his exclamation heaven's cause and the king's are one it said go forth sir william howe and trust in heaven to bring back a royal governor in triumph subduing at once the passion to which he had yielded only in the faith that it was unwitnessed sir william howe became conscious that an aged woman leaning on a staff was standing betwixt him and the door it was old esther dudley who had dwelt almost immemorial years in this mansion until her presence seemed as inseparable from it as the recollections of its history she was the daughter of an ancient and once eminent family which had fallen into poverty and decay and left its last descendant no resource save the bounty of the king nor any shelter except within the walls of the province house an office in the household with merely nominal duties had been assigned to her as a pretext for the payment of a small pension the greater part of which she expended in adorning herself with an antique magnificence of attire the claims of esther dudley's gentle blood were acknowledged by all the successive governors and they treated her with the punctilious courtesy which it was her foible to demand not always with success from a neglectful world the only actual share which she assumed in the business of the mansion was to glide through its passages and public chambers late at night to see that the servants had dropped no fire from their flaring torches nor left embers crackling and blazing on the hearths perhaps it was this invariable custom of walking her rounds in the hush of midnight that caused the superstition of the times to invest the old woman with attributes of awe and mystery fabling that she had entered the portal of the province house none knew whence in the train of the first royal governor and that it was her fate to dwell there till the last should have departed but sir william howe if he ever heard this legend had forgotten it chapter ix o lady we receive but what we give and in our life alone does nature live ours is her wedding garments ours her shrorwd ah from the soul itself must issue forth a light a glory a fair luminous cloud enveloping the earth and from the soul itself must there be sent a sweet and potent voice of its own birth of all sweet sounds the life and element coleridge from this time until i arrived at the palace of fairy land i can attempt no consecutive account of my wanderings and adventures everything henceforward existed for me in its relation to my attendant what influence he exercised upon everything into contact with which i was brought may be understood from a few detached instances to begin with this very day on which he first joined me after i had walked heartlessly along for two or three hours i was very weary and lay down to rest in a most delightful part of the forest carpeted with wild flowers i lay for half an hour in a dull repose and then got up to pursue my way the flowers on the spot where i had lain were crushed to the earth but i saw that they would soon lift their heads and rejoice again in the sun and air not so those on which my shadow had lain the very outline of it could be traced in the withered lifeless grass and the scorched and shrivelled flowers which stood there dead and hopeless of any resurrection i shuddered and hastened away with sad forebodings in a few days i had reason to dread an extension of its baleful influences from the fact that it was no longer confined to one position in regard to myself hitherto when seized with an irresistible desire to look on my evil demon which longing would unaccountably seize me at any moment returning at longer or shorter intervals sometimes every minute i had to turn my head backwards and look over my shoulder in which position as long as i could retain it i was fascinated but one day having come out on a clear grassy hill which commanded a glorious prospect though of what i cannot now tell my shadow moved round and came in front of me and presently a new manifestation increased my distress for it began to coruscate and shoot out on all sides a radiation of dim shadow these rays of gloom issued from the central shadow as from a black sun lengthening and shortening with continual change but wherever a ray struck that part of earth or sea or sky became void and desert and sad to my heart on this the first development of its new power one ray shot out beyond the rest seeming to lengthen infinitely until it smote the great sun on the face which withered and darkened beneath the blow i turned away and went on the shadow retreated to its former position and when i looked again it had drawn in all its spears of darkness and followed like a dog at my heels once as i passed by a cottage there came out a lovely fairy child with two wondrous toys one in each hand the one was the tube through which the poet looks when he beholds the same thing everywhere the other that through which he looks when he combines into new forms of loveliness those images of beauty which his own choice has gathered from all regions wherein he has travelled round the head was an aureole of emanating rays as i looked at him in wonder and delight round crept from behind me the something dark and the child stood in my shadow straightway he was a commonplace boy with a rough straw hat through which brim the sun shone from behind the toys he carried were a and a kaleidoscope i sighed and departed one evening as a great silent flood of western gold flowed through an avenue in the woods down the stream just as when i saw him first came the sad knight riding on his chestnut steed but his armour did not shine half so red as when i saw him first many a blow of mighty sword and axe turned aside by the strength of his mail and glancing adown the surface had swept from its path the fretted rust and the glorious steel had answered the kindly blow with the thanks of returning light these streaks and spots made his armour look like the floor of a forest in the sunlight his forehead was higher than before for the contracting wrinkles were nearly gone and the sadness that remained on his face was the sadness of a dewy summer twilight not that of a frosty autumn morn he too had met the as i but he had plunged into the torrent of mighty deeds and the stain was nearly washed away no shadow followed him he had not entered the dark house he had not had time to open the closet door will he ever look in i said to myself must his shadow find him some day but i could not answer my own questions chapter seventeen martin enlarges his circle of aquaintance increases his stock of wisdom and has an excellent opportunity of comparing his own experiences with those of lummy ned of the light salisbury as related by his friend mr william simmons it was characteristic of martin that all this while he had either forgotten mark tapley as completely as if there had been no such person in existence or if for a moment the figure of that gentleman rose before his mental vision had dismissed it as something by no means of a pressing nature which might be attended to and could wait his perfect leisure but being now in the streets again it occurred to him as just coming within the bare limits of possibility that mr tapley might in course of time grow tired of waiting on the threshold of the rowdy journal office so he intimated to his new friend that if they could conveniently walk in that direction he would be glad to get this piece of business off his mind and speaking of business said martin may i ask in order that i may not be with questions either whether your occupation holds you to this city or like myself you are a visitor here a visitor replied his friend i was raised in the state of massachusetts and reside there still my home is in a quiet country town i am not often in these busy places and my inclination to visit them does not increase with our better acquaintance i assure you you have been abroad asked martin oh yes and like most people who travel have become more than ever attached to your home and native country said martin eyeing him curiously to my home yes rejoined his friend to my native country as my home yes also you imply some reservation said martin well returned his new friend if you ask me whether i came back here with a greater relish for my faults with a greater fondness for those who claim at the rate of so many dollars a day to be her friends with a cooler indifference to the growth of principles among us in respect of public matters and of private dealings between man and man the advocacy of which beyond the foul atmosphere of a criminal trial would disgrace your own old bailey lawyers why then i answer plainly no oh said martin in so exactly the same key as his no that it sounded like an echo if you ask me his companion pursued whether i came back here better satisfied with a state of things which broadly divides society into two classes whereof one the great mass asserts a spurious independence most miserably dependent for its mean existence on the disregard of humanizing conventionalities of manner and social custom so that the coarser a man is the more distinctly it shall appeal to his taste while the other disgusted with the low standard thus set up and made adaptable to everything takes refuge among the graces and refinements it can bring to bear on private life and leaves the public weal to such fortune as may betide it in the press and uproar of a general scramble then again i answer no and again martin said oh in the same odd way as before being anxious and disconcerted not so much to say the truth on public grounds as with reference to the fading prospects of domestic architecture in a word resumed the other i do not find and cannot believe and therefore will not allow that we are a model of wisdom and an example to the world and the perfection of human reason and a great deal more to the same purpose which you may hear any hour in the day simply because we began our political life with two inestimable advantages what were they asked martin one that our history commenced at so late a period as to escape the ages of bloodshed and cruelty through which other nations have passed and so had all the light of their probation and none of its darkness the other that we have a vast territory and not as yet too many people on it these facts considered we have done little enough i think education suggested martin faintly pretty well on that head said the other shrugging his shoulders still no mighty matter to boast of for old countries and despotic countries too have done as much if not more and made less noise about it we shine out brightly in comparison with england certainly but hers is a very extreme case you complimented me on my frankness you know he added laughing oh i am not at all astonished at your speaking thus openly when my country is in question returned martin it is your in reference to your own that surprises me you will not find it a scarce quality here i assure you saving among the colonel divers and jefferson bricks and major pawkinses though the best of us are something like the man in comedy who suffer anybody but himself to abuse his master come he added let us talk of something else you have come here on some design of improving your fortune i dare say and i should grieve to put you out of heart i am some years older than you besides and may on a few trivial points advise you perhaps chapter xiv as i drove into the yard a old nigger with a game leg throwed down an armful of wood he was gathering and went limping up to the veranda as fast as he could he opened the door and bawled out pointing to us before he had it fairly open o marse willyum o miss lucy dey've brung him home dar he a little bright old lady like a wren comes running out of the house and chirps o bud o my honey boy is he dead i reckon not miss lucy says bud raising himself up on the mattress as she runs up to the wagon and trying to act like everything was all a joke she was jest high enough to kiss him over the edge of the wagon box a old gentleman come out the door seen bud and his mother kissing each other and then says to the old nigger man george yo old fool what do yo mean by shouting out like that marse willyum begins george explaining shut up says the old gentleman very quiet take the bay mare and go for doctor po'ter then he comes to the wagon and says so they got yo bud yo would go nightriding like a rowdy and a thug are yo much hurt he said it easy and gentle more than mad but bud he flushed up pale as he was and didn't answer his dad direct he turned to his mother and said miss lucy dear it would a done yo heart good to see the way them trust warehouses blazed up and the old lady smiling and crying both to oncet says god bless her brave boy but the old gentleman looked mighty serious and his worry settled into a frown between his eyes and he turns to me and says yo must pardon us sir fo neglecting to thank yo sooner i told him that would be all right fur him not to worry none and him and me and mandy which was the nigger cook got bud into the house and into his bed and his mother gets that busy ordering mandy and the old gentleman around to get things and fix things and make bud as easy as she could that you could see she was one of them kind of woman that gets a lot of satisfaction out of having some one sick to fuss over and after quite a while george gets back with doctor porter he sets bud's arm and he locates the bullet in him and he says he guesses he'll do in a few weeks if nothing like blood poisoning nor gangrene nor inflammation sets in only the doctor says he reckons instead of he guesses which they all do down there and they all had them kind of voices and didn't see no pertic'ler importance in their r's it wasn't that you could spell it no different when they talked but it sounded different i eat my breakfast with the old gentleman and then i took a sleep until time fur dinner they wouldn't hear of me leaving that night i fully intended to go on the next day but before i knowed it i been there a couple of days and have got very well acquainted with that fambly well that was a house divided agin itself miss lucy she is awful favourable to all this nightrider business she spunks up and her eyes sparkles whenever she thinks about that there tobaccer trust she would of like to been a herself but the old man he says law and order is the main pint what the country needs he says ain't burning down tobaccer warehouses and shooting your neighbours and licking them with switches fur no wrong done never righted another wrong but you were in the ku klux klan yo'self says miss lucy the old man says the ku kluxes was working fur a principle the principle of keeping the white supremacy on top of the nigger race fur if you let em quit work and go around balloting and voting it won't do it makes em biggity and a biggity nigger is laying up trouble fur himself because sooner or later he will get to thinking he is as good as one of these here you are always hearing so much talk about down south and if the was to stand fur that purty soon they would be sociable equality and next the hull dern country would be niggerized them there that come over from ireland and scotland and france and the great british islands and settled up the south jest simply couldn't afford to let that happen he says and so they ku kluxed the niggers to make em quit voting it was their job to make law and order he says which they couldn't be with niggers getting the idea they had a right to govern so they ku kluxed em like gentlemen but these here he says is agin law and order they can shoot up more law and order in one night than can be manufactured agin in ten years he was a very quiet peaceable old man mr davis was and bud says he was so dern foolish about law and order he had to up and shoot a man about fifteen years ago who hearn him talking and said he reminded him of a boston school teacher foreword it cannot be said that the everhard manuscript is an important historical document to the historian it bristles with errors not errors of fact but errors of interpretation looking back across the seven centuries that have lapsed since avis everhard completed her manuscript events and the bearings of events that were confused and veiled to her are clear to us she lacked perspective she was too close to the events she writes about nay she was merged in the events she has described nevertheless as a personal document the everhard manuscript is of inestimable value but here again enter error of perspective and vitiation due to the bias of love yet we smile indeed and forgive avis everhard for the heroic lines upon which she modelled her husband we know that he was not so colossal and that he loomed among the events of his times less largely than the manuscript would lead us to believe we know that ernest everhard was an exceptionally strong man but not so exceptional as his wife thought him to be he was after all but one of a large number of heroes who throughout the world devoted their lives to the revolution though it must be conceded that he did unusual work especially in his elaboration and interpretation of philosophy proletarian science and proletarian philosophy were his phrases for it and therein he shows the provincialism of his mind a defect however that was due to the times and that none in that day could escape but to return to the manuscript especially valuable is it in communicating to us the feel of those terrible times nowhere do we find more vividly portrayed the psychology of the persons that lived in that turbulent period embraced between the years and their mistakes and ignorance their doubts and fears and misapprehensions their ethical delusions their violent passions their inconceivable sordidness and selfishness these are the things that are so hard for us of this enlightened age to understand history tells us that these things were and biology and psychology tell us why they were but history and biology and psychology do not make these things alive we accept them as facts but we are left without sympathetic comprehension of them this sympathy comes to us however as we peruse the everhard manuscript we enter into the minds of the actors in that and for the time being their mental processes are our mental processes not alone do we understand avis everhard's love for her but we feel as he felt in those first days the vague and terrible loom of the oligarchy the iron heel well named we feel descending upon and crushing mankind and in passing we note that that historic phrase the iron heel originated in ernest everhard's mind this we may say is the one moot question that this document clears up previous to this the use of the phrase occurred in the pamphlet ye slaves written by george milford and published in december this george milford was an obscure agitator about whom nothing is known save the one additional bit of information gained from the manuscript which mentions that he was shot in the chicago commune evidently he had heard ernest everhard make use of the phrase in some public speech most probably when he was running for congress in the fall of from the manuscript we learn that everhard used the phrase at a private dinner in the spring of this is without discussion the occasion on which the oligarchy was so designated the rise of the oligarchy will always remain a cause of secret wonder to the historian and the philosopher other great historical events have their place in social evolution they were inevitable their coming could have been predicted with the same certitude that astronomers predict the outcome of the movements of stars without these other great historical events social evolution could not have proceeded primitive communism chattel slavery serf slavery and wage slavery were necessary in the evolution of society but it were ridiculous to assert that the iron heel was a necessary rather is it adjudged a step aside or a step backward to the social tyrannies that made the early world a hell but that were as necessary as the iron heel was unnecessary black as feudalism was yet the coming of it was inevitable what else than feudalism could have followed upon the breakdown of that great centralized governmental machine known as the roman empire not so however with the iron heel in the orderly procedure of social evolution there was no place for it it was not necessary and it was not inevitable it must always remain the great curiosity of history a whim a fantasy an apparition a thing unexpected and undreamed and it should serve as a warning to those rash political theorists of who speak with certitude of social processes capitalism was adjudged by the sociologists of the time to be the culmination of bourgeois rule the ripened fruit of the bourgeois revolution and we of can but applaud that judgment following upon capitalism it was held even by such intellectual and antagonistic giants as herbert spencer that socialism would come out of the decay of capitalism it was held would arise that flower of the ages the brotherhood of man instead of which appalling alike to us who look back and to those that lived at the time capitalism sent forth that monstrous offshoot the oligarchy iii the brother and sister dined alone clayton was finding his club a more comfortable place than his home in those days of his wife's disillusionment and hesitation about the future many weak creatures are curiously armed for the unequal conflict of existence some with fleetness of foot some with a weapon of malignance some with porcupine quills some with a possumlike instinct for playing dead of these last was fitzhugh he knew when to be silent when to keep out of the way when to sit tight and wait his wife had discovered that he was a fool that he perhaps owed more to his tailor than to any other single factor for the success of his splendid pose of the thorough gentleman yet she did not realize what an utter fool he was so clever had he been in the use of the art of discreet silence norman suspected him but could not believe a human being capable of such fathomless vacuity as he found whenever he tried to explore his brain after dinner norman took ursula to the opera to join the seldins and after the first act went to josephine who had come with only a deaf old aunt josephine loved music and to hear an opera from a box one must be alone norman entered as the lights went up it always gave him a feeling of dilation this spectacle of material splendor the women whose part it is throughout civilization to wear for public admiration and envy the evidences of the prowess of the males to whom they belong a truer version of dr holmes's aphorism would be that it takes several generations in oil to make a snob wholly to destroy a man's or a woman's point of view sense of the kinship of all flesh and to make him or her over into the genuine believer in caste and worshiper of it for all his keenness of mind of humor norman had the snobbishness of his family and friends he knew that caste was silly that such displays as this vulgar flaunting of jewels and costly dresses were in atrocious bad taste but it is one thing to know another thing to feel and his feeling was delight in the spectacle pride in his own high rank in the aristocracy his eyes rested with radiant pleasure on the girl he was to marry and she was indeed a person to appeal to the passion of pride simply and most expensively dressed in pearl satin with only a little jewelry she sat in the front of her parterre box a queen by right of her father's wealth her family's position her own beauty she was a large woman tall a big frame but not ungainly she had brilliant dark eyes a small proud head set upon shoulders that were slenderly young now and even when they should became matronly would still be beautiful she had good teeth an exquisite smile the gentle good humor of those who comfortable themselves would not have the slightest objection to all others being equally so because she laughed appreciatively and repeated amusingly she had great reputation for wit because she industriously picked up from men a plausible smatter of small talk about politics religion art and the like she was renowned as clever verging on profound and she believed herself both witty and wise as do thousands male and female with far less excuse she had selected norman for the same reason that he had selected her each recognized the other as the grand prize pity is not nearly so close kin to love as is the feeling that the other person satisfies to the uttermost all one's pet vanities it would have been next door to impossible for two people so well matched not to find themselves drawn to each other and filled with sympathy and the sense of comradeship so far as there can be comradeship where two are driving luxuriously along the way of life with not a serious cause for worry people without half the general fitness of these two for each other have gone through to the end regarding themselves and regarded as the most devoted of lovers indeed they were lovers only one of those savage tests to which in all probability they would never be exposed would or could reveal just how much or how little that vague variable word lovers meant when applied to them as their eyes met into each pair leaped the fine exalted light of pride in possession this wonderful woman is mine his eyes said and her eyes answered and you you most wonderful of men you are mine it always gave each of them a thrill like intoxication to meet after a day's separation all the joy of their dazzling good fortune burst upon them afresh i'll venture you haven't thought of me the whole day said she as he dropped to the chair behind her it was a remark she often made to give him the opportunity to say i've thought of little else i'm sorry to say i who have a career to look after he made the usual answer and they smiled happily at each other and you he said oh i what else has a woman to think about viii the crooked man one summer night a few months after my marriage i was seated by my own hearth smoking a last pipe and nodding over a novel for my work had been an exhausting one my wife had already gone upstairs and the sound of the locking of the hall door some time before told me that the servants had also retired i had risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my pipe when i suddenly heard the clang of the bell i looked at the clock it was a quarter to twelve this could not be a visitor at so late an hour a patient evidently and possibly an sitting with a wry face i went out into the hall and opened the door to my astonishment it was sherlock holmes who stood upon my step ah watson said he i hoped that i might not be too late to catch you my dear fellow pray come in you look surprised and no wonder relieved too i fancy hum you still smoke the arcadia mixture of your bachelor days then no mistaking that fluffy ash upon your coat easy to tell that you have been accustomed to wear a uniform watson never pass as a civilian as long as you keep that habit of carrying your handkerchief in your sleeve could you put me up with pleasure you told me that you had bachelor quarters for one and i see that you have no gentleman visitor at present your proclaims as much i shall be delighted if you will stay thank you fill the vacant peg then sorry to see that had the british workman in the house a token of evil not the drains i hope no the gas ah he has left two from his boot upon your linoleum just where the light strikes it no thank you i had some supper at waterloo but smoke a pipe with you with pleasure i handed him my pouch and he seated himself opposite to me and smoked for some time in silence i was well aware that nothing but business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour so i waited patiently until he should come round to it i see that you are professionally rather busy just now said he glancing very keenly across at me yes had a busy day i answered it may seem very foolish in your eyes i added but really i know how you deduced it holmes chuckled to himself i have the advantage of knowing your habits my dear watson said he when your round is a short one you walk and when it is a long one you use a hansom as i perceive that your boots although used are by no means dirty i cannot doubt that you are at present busy enough to justify the hansom excellent i cried elementary said he it is one of those instances where the reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his neighbour because the latter has missed the one little point which is the basis of the deduction the same may be said my dear fellow for the effect of some of these little sketches of yours which is entirely meretricious depending as it does upon your retaining in your own hands some factors in the problem which are never imparted to the reader now at present i am in the position of these same readers for i hold in this hand several threads of one of the strangest cases which ever perplexed a brain and yet i lack the one or two which are needful to complete my theory but have them watson have them his eyes kindled and a slight flush sprang into his thin cheeks for an instant only when i glanced again his face had resumed that composure which had made so many regard him as a machine rather than a man the problem presents features of interest said he i may even say exceptional features of interest i have already looked into the matter and have come as i think within sight of my solution if you could accompany me in that last step you might be of considerable service to me i should be delighted could you go as far as aldershot i have no doubt jackson would take my practice very good i want to start by the from waterloo that would give me time then if you are not too sleepy i will give you a sketch of what has happened and of what remains to be done i was sleepy before you came i am quite wakeful now i will compress the story as far as may be done without omitting anything vital to the case it is conceivable that you may even have read some account of the matter it is the supposed murder of colonel barclay of the royal mallows at aldershot which i am investigating chapter xxx the letter from the ship daylight showed us how solitary the inn stood it was plainly hard upon the sea yet out of all view of it and beset on every side with scabbit hills of sand there was indeed only one thing in the nature of a prospect where there stood out over a brae the two sails of a windmill like an ears but with the ass quite hidden it was strange after the wind rose for at first it was dead calm to see the turning and following of each other of these great sails behind the hillock scarce any road came by there but a number of footways travelled among the bents in all directions up to mr door the truth is he was a man of many trades not any one of them honest and the position of his inn was the best of his livelihood smugglers frequented it political agents and forfeited persons bound across the water came there to await their passages and i daresay there was worse behind for a whole family might have been butchered in that house and nobody the wiser i slept little and ill long ere it was day i had slipped from beside my bedfellow and was warming myself at the fire or walking to and fro before the door dawn broke mighty sullen but a little after sprang up a wind out of the west which burst the clouds let through the sun and set the mill to the turning there was something of spring in the sunshine or else it was in my heart and the appearing of the great sails one after another from behind the hill diverted me extremely at times i could hear a creak of the machinery and by eight of the day and i thought this dreary desert place was like a paradise for all which as the day drew on and nobody came near i began to be aware of an uneasiness that i could scarce explain it seemed there was trouble afoot the sails of the windmill as they came up and went down over the hill were like persons spying and outside of all fancy it was surely a strange neighbourhood and house for a young lady to be brought to dwell in at breakfast which we took late it was manifest that james more was in some danger or perplexity manifest that alan was alive to the same and watched him close and this appearance of duplicity upon the one side and vigilance upon the other held me on live coals the meal was no sooner over than james seemed to come began to make apologies he had an appointment of a private nature in the town it was with the french nobleman he told me and we would please excuse him till about noon meanwhile he carried his daughter aside to the far end of the room where he seemed to speak rather earnestly and she to listen with much inclination i am caring less and less about this man james said alan something no right with the man james and i shouldnae wonder but what alan breck would give an eye to him this day i would like fine to see yon french nobleman davie and i daresay you could find an employ to yoursel and that would be to speir at the lassie for some news o your affair just tell it to her plainly tell her a muckle ass at the and then if i were you and ye could do it naitural i would just mint to her i was in some kind of a danger a weemenfolk likes that i cannae lee alan i cannae do it naitural says i mocking him the more fool you says he then can tell her that i recommended it set her to the laughing and i wouldnae wonder but what that was the next best but see to the pair of them if i didnae feel just sure of the lassie and that she was awful pleased and chief with alan i would think there was some kind of about you and is she so pleased with ye then alan i asked she thinks a heap of me says he and no like you one that can tell that she does she thinks a heap of alan and troth thinking a good deal of him mysel and with your permission shaws be getting a wee yont amang the bents so that i can see what way james goes one after another went till i was left alone beside the breakfast table james to dunkirk alan dogging him catriona up the stairs to her own chamber i could very well understand how she should avoid to be alone with me yet was none the better pleased with it for that and bent my mind to entrap her to an interview before the men returned upon the whole the best appeared to me to do like alan if i was out of view among the sandhills the fine morning would decoy her forth and once i had her in the open i could please myself chapter the child was closely followed by an elderly man of remarkably hard features and forbidding aspect and so low in stature as to be quite a dwarf though his head and face were large enough for the body of a giant his black eyes were restless sly and cunning his mouth and chin bristly with the stubble of a coarse hard beard and his complexion was one of that kind which never looks clean or wholesome but what added most to the grotesque expression of his face was a ghastly smile which appearing to be the mere result of habit and to have no connection with any mirthful or complacent feeling constantly revealed the few discoloured fangs that were yet scattered in his mouth and gave him the aspect of a panting dog his dress consisted of a large hat a worn dark suit a pair of capacious shoes and a dirty white neckerchief sufficiently limp and crumpled to disclose the greater portion of his wiry throat such hair as he had was of a grizzled black cut short and straight upon his temples and hanging in a frowzy fringe about his ears his hands which were of a rough coarse grain were very dirty his fingernails were crooked long and yellow there was ample time to note these particulars for besides that they were sufficiently obvious without very close observation some moments elapsed before any one broke silence the child advanced timidly towards her brother and put her hand in his the dwarf if we may call him so glanced keenly at all present and the who plainly had not expected his uncouth visitor seemed disconcerted and embarrassed ah said the dwarf who with his hand stretched out above his eyes had been surveying the young man attentively that should be your grandson neighbour say rather that he should not be replied the old man but he is and that said the dwarf pointing to dick swiveller some friend of his as welcome here as he said the old man and that inquired the dwarf wheeling round and pointing straight at me a gentleman who was so good as to bring nell home the other night when she lost her way coming from your house the little man turned to the child as if to chide her or express his wonder but as she was talking to the young man held his peace and bent his head to listen well nelly said the young fellow aloud do they teach you to hate me eh no no for shame oh no cried the child to love me perhaps pursued her brother with a sneer to do neither she returned they never speak to me about you indeed they never do i dare be bound for that he said darting a bitter look at the grandfather i dare be bound for that nell oh i believe you there but i love you dearly fred said the child no doubt i do indeed and always will the child repeated with great emotion but oh if you would leave off vexing him and making him unhappy then i could love you more i see said the young man as he stooped carelessly over the child and having kissed her pushed her from him there get you away now you have said your lesson you whimper we part good friends enough if the matter he remained silent following her with his eyes until she had gained her little room and closed the door and then turning to the dwarf said abruptly harkee mr meaning me returned the dwarf quilp is my name you might remember not a long one daniel quilp harkee mr quilp then pursued the other you have some influence with my grandfather there some said mr quilp emphatically and are in a few of his mysteries and secrets a few replied quilp with equal dryness then let me tell him once for all through you that i will come into and go out of this place as often as i like so long as he keeps nell here and that if he wants to be quit of me he must first be quit of her what have i done to be made a bugbear of and to be shunned and dreaded as if i brought the plague tell you that i have no natural affection and that i care no more for nell for her own sake than i do for him let him say so i care for the whim then of coming to and fro and reminding her of my existence i will see her when i please my point i came here to maintain it and come here again fifty times with the same object and always with the same success i said i would stop till i had gained it i have done so and now my ended come dick stop cried mr swiveller as his companion turned toward the door sir sir i am your humble servant said mr quilp to whom the monosyllable was addressed before i leave the gay and festive scene and halls of dazzling light sir said mr swiveller i will with your permission attempt a slight remark i came here sir this day under the impression that the old min was friendly freedom for a moment there was silence following tom's wild cry and the noise of the thunderclap then as other though less loud reverberations of the storm continued to sound the captives awoke to a realization of what had happened they had been partially stunned and were almost as in a dream are are we all right stammered ned bless my soul what has happened cried mr damon we've been struck by lightning tom repeated i don't know whether we're all right or not we seem to be falling exclaimed lieutenant marbury if the whole gas bag isn't ripped to pieces we're lucky commented jerry mound indeed it was evident that the mars was sinking rapidly to all there came the sensation of riding in an elevator in a skyscraper and being dropped a score of stories then as they stood there in the darkness illuminated only by flashes from the lightning outside the window waiting for an unknown fate tom swift uttered a cry of delight we've stopped falling he cried the automatic gas machine is pumping part of the gas bag was punctured but the unbroken compartments hold if part of the gas leaked out i don't see why it wasn't all set on fire and exploded observed captain warner it's a gas tom quickly explained but come on this may be our very chance there seems to be something going on that may be in our favor indeed the captives could hear confused cries and the running to and fro of many feet he made for the sawed panel and in another instant had burst out and was through it out into the passageway between the after and amidship cabins his companions followed him they looked into the rear cabin or motor compartment and a scene of confusion met their gaze two of the foreign men who had seized the ship lay stretched out on the floor near the humming machinery which had been left to run itself a look in the other direction toward the main cabin showed a group of the foreign spies bending over the inert body of la foy the frenchman stretched out on a couch what has happened cried ned what does it all mean the lightning exclaimed tom the bolt that struck the ship has knocked out some of our enemies now is the time to attack them the mars seemed to have passed completely through a narrow storm belt she was now in a quiet atmosphere though behind her could be seen the fitful play of lightning and there could be heard the distant rumble of thunder come on cried tom we must act quickly while they are demoralized come on his friends needed no further urging jerry mound and the machinist rushed to the to look after any of the enemy that might be there while tom ned and the others ran into the middle cabin grab em tie em up cried tom for they had no weapons with which to make an attack but none were needed so stunned were the foreigners by the lightning bolt which had miraculously passed our friends and so unnerved by the striking down of la foy their leader that they seemed like men half asleep before they could offer any resistance they were bound with the same ropes that had held our friends in bondage that is all but the big frenchman himself he seemed beyond the need of binding mound the engineer and his assistant came hurrying in from the followed by koku we found him chained up jerry explained as the big giant freed from his captivity rubbed his chafed wrists are there any of the foreigners back there only those two knocked out by the lightning the engineer explained we've made them secure i see you've got things here in shape yes replied tom and now to see where we are and to get back home whew but this has been a time koku what happened to you they no let anything happen i be in chains all the while the giant answered jump on me before i can do anything well you're out now and i think we'll have you stand guard over these men the tables are turned koku the bound ones were carried to the same prison whence our friends had escaped but their bonds were not taken off and koku was put in the place with them by this time la foy and the two other stricken men showed signs of returning life they had only been stunned the young inventor and his friends once more in possession of their airship lost little time in planning to return they found that the spies were all expert aeronauts and had kept a careful chart of their location they were then halfway across the atlantic and in a short time longer would probably have been in some foreign country but tom turned the mars about the craft had only been slightly damaged by the lightning bolt though three of the gas bag compartments were torn the others sufficed however to make the ship sufficiently buoyant when morning came tom and his friends had matters running almost as smoothly as before their capture the prisoners had no chance to escape and indeed they seemed to have been broken in spirit la foy was no longer the insolent mocking frenchman that he had been and the two chief foreign engineers seemed to have lost some of their reason when the lightning struck them jo's will as allan woodcourt and jo proceed along the streets where the high church spires and the distances are so near and clear in the morning light that the city itself seems renewed by rest allan revolves in his mind how and where he shall bestow his companion it surely is a strange fact he considers that in the heart of a civilized world this creature in human form should be more difficult to dispose of than an unowned dog but it is none the less a fact because of its strangeness and the difficulty remains at first he looks behind him often to assure himself that jo is still really following but look where he will he still beholds him close to the opposite houses making his way with his wary hand from brick to brick and from door to door and often as he creeps along glancing over at him watchfully soon satisfied that the last thing in his thoughts is to give him the slip allan goes on considering with a less divided attention what he shall do a at a suggests the first thing to be done he stops there looks round and beckons jo jo crosses and comes halting and shuffling up slowly scooping the knuckles of his right hand round and round in the hollowed palm of his left kneading dirt with a natural pestle and mortar what is a dainty repast to jo is then set before him and he begins to gulp the coffee and to gnaw the bread and butter looking anxiously about him in all directions as he eats and drinks like a scared animal but he is so sick and miserable that even hunger has abandoned him i thought i was amost sir says jo soon putting down his food but i don't know nothink not even that i don't care for eating wittles nor yet for drinking on em and jo stands shivering and looking at the breakfast wonderingly allan woodcourt lays his hand upon his pulse and on his chest draw breath jo it draws says jo as heavy as a cart he might add and rattles like it but he only mutters i'm on sir allan looks about for an apothecary's shop there is none at hand but a tavern does as well or better he obtains a little measure of wine and gives the lad a portion of it very carefully he begins to revive almost as soon as it passes his lips we may repeat that dose jo observes allan after watching him with his attentive face so now we will take five minutes rest and then go on again leaving the boy sitting on the bench of the with his back against an iron railing allan woodcourt paces up and down in the early sunshine casting an occasional look towards him without appearing to watch him it requires no discernment to perceive that he is warmed and refreshed if a face so shaded can brighten his face brightens somewhat and by little and little he eats the slice of bread he had so hopelessly laid down observant of these signs of improvement allan engages him in conversation and elicits to his no small wonder the adventure of the lady in the veil with all its consequences jo slowly munches as he slowly tells it when he has finished his story and his bread they go on again intending to refer his difficulty in finding a temporary place of refuge for the boy to his old patient zealous little miss flite allan leads the way to the court where he and jo first foregathered but all is changed at the rag and bottle shop miss flite no longer lodges there it is shut up and a female much obscured by dust whose age is a problem but who is indeed no other than the interesting judy is tart and spare in her replies these sufficing however to inform the visitor that miss flite and her birds are domiciled with a mrs blinder in bell yard he repairs to that neighbouring place where miss flite who rises early that she may be punctual at the divan of justice held by her excellent friend the chancellor comes running downstairs with tears of welcome and with open arms my dear physician cries miss flite my meritorious distinguished honourable officer she uses some odd expressions but is as cordial and full of heart as sanity itself can be more so than it often is allan very patient with her waits until she has no more raptures to express then points out jo trembling in a doorway and tells her how he comes there where can i lodge him hereabouts for the present now you have a fund of knowledge and good sense and can advise me miss flite mighty proud of the compliment sets herself to consider but it is long before a bright thought occurs to her mrs blinder is entirely let and she herself occupies poor gridley's room gridley exclaims miss flite clapping her hands after a twentieth repetition of this remark gridley to be sure of course my dear physician general george will help us out it is hopeless to ask for any information about general george and would be though miss flite had not already run upstairs to put on her pinched bonnet and her poor little shawl and to arm herself with her reticule of documents but as she informs her physician in her disjointed manner on coming down in full array that general george whom she often calls upon knows her dear fitz jarndyce and takes a great interest in all connected with her allan is induced to think that they may be in the right way so he tells jo for his encouragement that this walking about will soon be over now and they repair to the general's fortunately it is not far the king of the greeks big alec had never been captured by the fish patrol it was his boast that no man could take him alive and it was his history that of the many men who had tried to take him dead none had succeeded it was also history that at least two patrolmen who had tried to take him dead had died themselves further no man violated the fish laws more systematically and deliberately than big alec he was called big alec because of his gigantic stature his height was six feet three inches and he was correspondingly and he was splendidly muscled and hard as steel and there were innumerable stories in circulation among the concerning his prodigious strength he was as bold and dominant of spirit as he was strong of body and because of this he was widely known by another name that of the king of the greeks the fishing population was largely composed of greeks and they looked up to him and obeyed him as their chief and as their chief he fought their fights for them saw that they were protected saved them from the law when they fell into its clutches and made them stand by one another and himself in time of trouble in the old days the fish patrol had attempted his capture many disastrous times and had finally given it over so that when the word was out that he was coming to benicia i was most anxious to see him but i did not have to hunt him up in his usual bold way the first thing he did on arriving was to hunt us up charley le grant and i at the time were under a patrolman named carmintel and the three of us were on the reindeer preparing for a trip when big alec stepped aboard carmintel evidently knew him for they shook hands in recognition big alec took no notice of charley or me come down to fish sturgeon a couple of months he said to carmintel his eyes flashed with challenge as he spoke and we noticed the eyes drop before him all right alec carmintel said in a low voice not bother you come on into the cabin and talk things over he added when they had gone inside and shut the doors after them charley winked with slow deliberation at me but i was only a youngster and new to men and the ways of some men so i did not understand nor did charley explain though i felt there was something wrong about the business leaving them to their conference at suggestion we boarded our skiff and pulled over to the old steamboat wharf where big ark was lying an ark is a of small though comfortable dimensions and is as necessary to the upper bay fisherman as are nets and boats we were both curious to see big ark for history said that it had been the scene of more than one pitched battle and that it was riddled with we found the holes stopped with wooden plugs and painted over but there were not so many as i had expected charley noted my look of disappointment and laughed and then to comfort me he gave an authentic account of one expedition which had descended upon big floating home to capture him alive preferably dead if necessary at the end of half a fighting the patrolmen had drawn off in wrecked boats with one of their number killed and three wounded and when they returned next morning with reinforcements they found only the of big ark the ark itself remained hidden for months in the fastnesses of the suisun tules but why was he not hanged for murder i demanded surely the united states is powerful enough to bring such a man to justice he gave himself up and stood trial charley answered it cost him fifty thousand dollars to win the case which he did on technicalities and with the aid of the best lawyers in the state every greek fisherman on the river contributed to the sum big alec levied and collected the tax for all the world like a king the united states may be my lad but the fact remains that big alec is a king inside the united states with a country and subjects all his own but what are you going to do about his fishing for sturgeon bound to fish with a chinese line charley shrugged his shoulders see what we will see he said enigmatically now a chinese line is a cunning device invented by the people whose name it bears by a simple system of floats weights and anchors thousands of hooks each on a separate leader are suspended at a distance of from six inches to a foot above the bottom the remarkable thing about such a line is the hook it is barbless and in place of the barb the hook is filed long and tapering to a point as sharp as that of a needle these hoods are only a few inches apart and when several thousand of them are suspended just above the bottom like a fringe for a couple of hundred fathoms they present a formidable obstacle to the fish that travel along the bottom christmas concert it was several nights before christmas and all along the freeway cars were lined up like a vast herd of reindeer being led off to slaughter i glanced away from the sight and reached out to snap off the radio i'd had far too much of the messiah since thanksgiving you'd think a respectable classical station could think of something more original to saturate the airwaves with but i knew that even if i changed the station i'd get white christmas or blue christmas or dixie christmas or some other form of musical blasphemy traffic moved along sluggishly inching up a long curving hill it was raining heavily one of those sudden tropical storms only it was happening in a refrigerator i had the windshield wipers on full but still i could hardly see the vehicle in front of me along with every other irate father uncle brother and son who was late for some engagement or another i was in the fast lane i had gotten caught in a sales meeting and i was going to be late for my daughter's concert if the idiot in front of me didn't hurry up the offending car was a jeep jacked up on all fours with tires big enough to dwarf a and had struts and shock absorbers and sticking out all over the undercarriage a real useful piece of machinery for navigating the treacherous silicon valley freeways when you see a car you don't like you just roll right over it the jeep had one of those typical california vanity plates held in place by a brass frame which had i been able to read it in the dark would have said my other truck is a mack the driver was pumping on his brakes continually no doubt keeping time to some country christmas hit classic lounging on top of this pinnacle of western automotive engineering was a christmas tree lashed with a couple pieces of thin twine probably on its way to a living room hung with paintings of nudes on black velvet and soon to be littered with tacky country decorations and strings of popcorn the tree listed to one side bobbing over the edge of the jeep's roof in time with the blinking brake lights the driver's girlfriend was smooching up to him in the front seat i could see her outline through the back window practically sitting in his lap maybe she was in his lap i started thinking they probably deserved to lose the whole tree they'd have a real nice surprise when they got home without it i reached over to turn on the radio again thinking the hourly excerpt from the messiah might be over by then i should have brought a tape from home but i'd barely had time to change my suit just when my eyes were averted for an instant the bedecked vehicle in front of me decided to drop its load i felt my car go bump bump and slammed on my brakes before i even looked up the car behind me skidded and swerved to one side then leaned on his horn as if he'd run into an iceberg i just hit the emergency lights and leaned on my own horn the guy in front perhaps hearing the tooting chorus behind him stopped just down the road and like an idiot put his jeep into reverse and came hurtling back toward me he skidded to a stop and put on his emergency lights what kind of jerk ties down a christmas tree so loosely that it flops off in the middle of a freeway we were only doing twenty miles an hour in the rain no less i thought i would have to get out and check the extent of the damage and i wasn't happy about slogging in the rain with my dress shoes on hallelujah the jerk stopped anyway so i could at least get the name of his insurance company i'd already memorized his personal license number which doesn't bear repeating i'd always thought the dmv had standards of decency i hopped out trying to pull up the collar of my overcoat even though it wouldn't quite cover my head and started walking forward to have a few choice words with mister country jamboree in the automobile of course cj as i then dubbed the driver bounded out of the jeep and headed my way tucking in his shirt as he walked one look at him and i almost turned around and left cj could have been paul bunyan's twin brother he had the shirt to prove it too red and black lumberjack style checks with the top three buttons undone and chest hair that was thicker than my beard he also wore cowboy boots and wide red suspenders holy moley mister he yelled with a tone of real concern you alright i was about to lay into him when his girlfriend appeared from behind tucking herself into his armpit oh she squealed ah'm so sorry looks like our tree smashed up your brand new car my car wasn't exactly brand new but i looked around to where she pointed sure enough the front grill was bent in and one headlight had gone out the glass completely smashed the tree itself was nestled cozily under the car nuzzling up against the oil pan xix dr macbride begs pardon judge and mrs henry molly wood and two strangers a lady and a gentleman were the party which had been driving in the large wagon they had seemed a merry party but as i came within hearing of their talk it was a fragment of the minister's sonority which reached me first more opportunity for them to have the benefit of hearing frequent sermons was the sentence i heard him bring to completion yes to be sure sir judge henry gave me it almost seemed additional warmth of welcome for arriving to break up the present discourse let me introduce you to the rev dr alexander macbride doctor another guest we have been hoping for about this time was my host's cordial explanation to him of me there remained the gentleman with his wife from new york and to these i made my final bows but i had not broken up the discourse we may be said to have met already dr macbride had fixed upon me his full mastering eye and it occurred to me that if they had policemen in heaven he would be at least a centurion in the force but he did not mean to be unpleasant it was only that in a mind full of matters less worldly pleasure was left out i observed your friend was a skilful horseman he continued i was saying to judge henry that i could wish such skilful horsemen might ride to a church upon the sabbath a church that is of right doctrine where they would have opportunity to hear frequent sermons yes said judge henry yes it would be a good thing mrs henry with some murmur about the kitchen here went into the house i was informed dr macbride held the rest of us before undertaking my journey that i should find a desolate and mainly godless country but nobody gave me to understand that from medicine bow i was to drive three hundred miles and pass no church of any faith the judge explained that there had been a few a long way to the right and left of him still he conceded you are quite right but don't forget that this is the newest part of a new world judge said his wife coming to the door how can you keep them standing in the dust with your talking this most efficiently did break up the discourse as our little party with the smiles and the polite holdings back of new acquaintanceship moved into the house the judge detained me behind all of them long enough to whisper dolorously he's going to stay a whole week i had hopes that he would not stay a whole week when i presently learned of the crowded arrangements which our hosts with many hospitable apologies disclosed to us they were delighted to have us but they hadn't foreseen that we should all be simultaneous the foreman's house had been prepared for two of us and did we mind the two of us were dr macbride and myself and i expected him to mind but i wronged him grossly it would be much better he assured mrs henry than straw in a stable which he had tried several times and was quite ready for so i saw that though he kept his vigorous body clean when he could he cared nothing for it in the face of his mission how the foreman and his wife relished being turned out during a week for a missionary and myself was not my concern although while he and i made ready for supper over there it struck me as hard on them the room with its two cots and furniture was as nice as possible and we closed the door upon the adjoining room which however seemed also untenanted mrs henry gave us a meal so good that i have remembered it and her husband the judge strove his best that we should eat it in merriment he poured out his anecdotes like wine and we should have quickly warmed to them but dr macbride sat among us giving occasional heavy which produced as miss molly wood whispered to me a dreadfully cavernous effect was it his sermon we wondered that he was thinking over i told her of the copious sheaf of them i had seen him pull from his wallet over at the foreman's goodness said she then are we to hear one every evening this i doubted he had probably been picking one out suitable for the occasion putting his best foot foremost was her comment i suppose they have best feet like the rest of us then she grew delightfully sharp do you know when i first heard him i thought his voice was hearty but if you listen you'll find it's merely militant he never really meets you with it he's off on his hill watching the the whole time he will find a hardened pagan here judge henry oh no the wild man you're taming brought you kenilworth safe back she was smooth oh as for taming him but don't you find him intelligent suddenly i somehow knew that she didn't want to tame him but what did she want to do the thought of her had made him blush this afternoon no thought of him made her blush this evening viii in america we have been bringing up our women like men and treating them like children they have active minds with nothing to act upon thus they are driven to think chiefly about themselves with jane hastings took the form of most of the time she was intensely interested in what she regarded as the new development of her character this definite and apparently final decision for the narrow and the ungenerous in fact it was no new development but simply a revelation to herself of her own real character she was seeing at last the genuine jane hastings inevitable product of a certain heredity in a certain environment the high thinking and talking the idealistic aspiration were pose and pretense jane hastings was a selfish person ready to do almost any base thing to gain her ends ready to hate to the uttermost any one who stood between her and her object i'm certainly not a lovely person not a lovable person thought she with that gentle tolerance wherewith we regard our ownselves whether in the dress of pretense or in the undress of deformed humanness still i am what i am and i've got to make the best of it as she thought of selma's declaration of war she became less and less disturbed about it selma neither would nor could do anything sly whatever she attempted in the open would only turn victor dorn more strongly toward herself however she must continue to try to see him must go to see him in a few days if she did not happen upon him in her rides or walks how poorly he would think of her if he knew the truth about her but then how poor most women and men too would look in a strong and just light few indeed could stand idealizing except victor no one she knew and he was human enough not to make her uncomfortable in his presence but it so happened that before she could see victor dorn her father disobeyed dr charlton and gave way to the appetite that was the chief cause of his physical woes he felt so well that he ate the family dinner including a peach cobbler with whipped cream which even the robust jane adventured warily martha was dining with them she abetted her father it's light said she it couldn't harm anybody you mustn't touch it popsy said jane she unthinkingly spoke a little too commandingly her father in a perverse and reckless mood took martha's advice an hour later dr charlton was summoned and had he not arrived promptly another fifteen or twenty minutes said he to the old man when he had him out of immediate danger and i'd have had nothing to do but sign a certificate of natural death murder would have been nearer the truth said martin feebly that there fool martha come out from behind that petticoat cried charlton didn't i spend the best part of three days in giving you the correct ideas as to health and disease in showing you that all disease comes from indigestion all disease from falling hair and sore eyes to weak ankles and corns and didn't i convince you that you could eat only the things i told you about don't hit a man when he's down groaned hastings if i don't you'll do the same idiotic trick again when i get you up if i get you up hastings looked quickly at him this was the first time charlton had ever expressed a doubt about his living do you mean that he said hoarsely or are you just trying to scare me both said charlton i'll do my best but i can't promise i've lost confidence in you no wonder doctors after they've been in practice a few years stop talking food and digestion to their patients i've never been able to convince a single human being that appetite is not the sign of health and yielding to it the way to health but i've made lots of people angry and have lost their trade i had hopes of you you were such a hopeless wreck but no and you call yourself an intelligent man i'll never do it again said hastings pleading but smiling too charlton's way of talking delighted him you think this is a joke said charlton shaking his bullet head have you any affairs to settle if you have send for your lawyer in the morning fear the great fear suddenly laid its icy long fingers upon the throat of the old man he gasped and his eyes rolled don't trifle with me charlton he muttered you know you will pull me through i'll do my best said charlton i promise nothing i'm serious about the lawyer i don't want no lawyer hanging round my bed growled the old man it'd kill me i've got nothing to settle i don't run things with loose ends and there's jinny and marthy and the boy share and share alike well you're in no immediate danger i'll come early wait till i get to sleep you'll be asleep as soon as the light's down but i'll stop a few minutes and talk to your daughter charlton found jane at the window in the dressing room next her father's bedroom he said loudly enough for the old man to overhear chapter ii genevieve and joe were aristocrats in an environment made up largely of sordidness and wretchedness they had kept themselves unsullied and wholesome theirs was a a regard for the niceties and clean things of life which had held them aloof from their kind friends did not come to them easily nor had either ever possessed a really intimate friend a with whom to chum and have things in common the social instinct was strong in them yet they had remained lonely because they could not satisfy that instinct and at that same time satisfy their desire for cleanness and decency if ever a girl of the working class had led the sheltered life it was genevieve in the midst of roughness and brutality she had shunned all that was rough and brutal she saw but what she chose to see and she chose always to see the best avoiding coarseness and uncouthness without effort as a matter of instinct to begin with she had been peculiarly unexposed an only child with an invalid mother upon whom she attended she had not joined in the street games and frolics of the children of the neighbourhood her father a anaemic little clerk domestic because of his inherent disability to mix with men had done his full share toward giving the home an atmosphere of sweetness and tenderness an orphan at twelve genevieve had gone straight from her father's funeral to live with the silversteins in their rooms above the candy store and here sheltered by kindly aliens she earned her keep and clothes by waiting on the shop being gentile she was especially necessary to the silversteins who would not run the business themselves when the day of their sabbath came round and here in the uneventful little shop six maturing years had slipped by her acquaintances were few she had elected to have no girl chum for the reason that no satisfactory girl had appeared nor did she choose to walk with the young fellows of the neighbourhood as was the custom of girls from their fifteenth year that was the way the girls of the neighbourhood described her and though she earned their enmity by her beauty and aloofness she none the less commanded their respect peaches and cream she was called by the young men though softly and amongst themselves for they were afraid of arousing the ire of the other girls while they stood in awe of genevieve in a dimly religious way as a something mysteriously beautiful and unapproachable for she was indeed beautiful springing from a long line of american descent she was one of those wonderful blooms which occasionally appear defying all precedent of forebears and environment apparently without cause or explanation she was a beauty in color the blood spraying her white skin so deliciously as to earn for her the apt description peaches and cream she was a beauty in the regularity of her features and if for no other reason she was a beauty in the mere delicacy of the lines on which she was moulded quiet stately and dignified she somehow had the knack of dress and but befitted her beauty and dignity with anything she put on withal she was sheerly feminine tender and soft and clinging with the smouldering passion of the mate and the motherliness of the woman but this side of her nature had lain dormant through the years waiting for the mate to appear then joe came into silverstein's shop one hot saturday afternoon to cool himself with soda she had not noticed his entrance being busy with one other customer an urchin of six or seven who gravely analyzed his desires before the wherein truly generous and marvellous candy creations reposed under a cardboard announcement five for five cents she had heard soda please and had herself asked what flavor without seeing his face for that matter it was not a custom of hers to notice young men there was something about them she did not understand the way they looked at her made her uncomfortable she knew not why while there was an uncouthness and roughness about them that did not please her as yet her imagination had been untouched by man the young fellows she had seen had held no lure for her had been without meaning to her in short had she been asked to give one reason for the existence of men on the earth she would have been nonplussed for a reply as she emptied the measure of into the glass her casual glance rested on joe's face and she experienced on the instant a pleasant feeling of satisfaction the next instant his eyes were upon her face her eyes had dropped and she was turning away toward the soda fountain but at the fountain filling the glass she was impelled to look at him again but for no more than an instant for this time she found his eyes already upon her waiting to meet hers while on his face was a frankness of interest that caused her quickly to look away that such pleasingness would reside for her in any man astonished her what a pretty boy she thought to herself innocently and instinctively trying to ward off the power to hold and draw her that lay behind the mere prettiness besides he isn't pretty she thought as she placed the glass before him received the silver dime in payment and for the third time looked into his eyes her vocabulary was limited and she knew little of the worth of words but the strong masculinity of his boy's face told her that the term was inappropriate section as the evening drew on karenin and those who were about him went up upon the roof of the buildings so that they might the better watch the sunset and the flushing of the mountains and the coming of the afterglow they were joined by two of the surgeons from the laboratories below and presently by a nurse who brought karenin refreshment in a thin glass cup it was a cloudless windless evening under the deep blue sky and far away to the north glittered two biplanes on the way to the observatories on everest two hundred miles distant over the precipices to the east the little group of people watched them pass over the mountains and vanish into the blue and then for a time they talked of the work that the observatory was doing from that they passed to the whole process of research about the world and so thoughts returned again to the mind of the world and the great future that was opening upon imagination he asked the surgeons many questions upon the detailed possibilities of their science and he was keenly interested and excited by the things they told him and as they talked the sun touched the mountains and became very swiftly a blazing and indented hemisphere of liquid flame and sank karenin looked blinking at the last quivering rim of incandescence and shaded his eyes and became silent presently he gave a little start what asked rachel borken i had forgotten he said what had you forgotten i had forgotten about the operation i have been so interested as man that i have nearly forgotten marcus karenin marcus karenin must go under your knife fowler and very probably marcus karenin will die he raised his slightly shrivelled hand it does not matter fowler it scarcely matters even to me for indeed is it karenin who has been sitting here and talking is it not rather a common mind fowler that has played about between us you and i and all of us have added thought to thought but the thread is neither you nor me what is true we all have when the individual has altogether brought himself to the test and winnowing of expression then the individual is done i feel as though i had already been emptied out of that little vessel that marcus karenin which in my youth held me so tightly and completely your beauty dear edith and your broad brow dear rachel and you fowler with your firm and skilful hands are now almost as much to me as this hand that beats the arm of my chair and as little me and the spirit that desires to know the spirit that resolves to do that spirit that lives and has talked in us lived in athens lived in florence lives on i know for ever and you old sun with your sword of flame searing these poor eyes of marcus for the last time of all beware of me you think i die and indeed i am only taking off one more coat to get at you i have threatened you for ten thousand years and soon i warn you i shall be coming when i am altogether stripped and my disguises thrown away very soon now old sun i shall launch myself at you and i shall reach you and i shall put my foot on your spotted face and tug you about by your fiery locks one step i shall take to the moon and then i shall leap at you talked to you before old sun talked to you a million times and now i am beginning to remember yes long ago long ago before i had stripped off a few thousand generations dust now and forgotten i was a hairy savage and i pointed my hand at you and clearly i remember it i saw you in a net have you forgotten that old sun old sun i gather myself together out of the pools of the individual that have held me dispersed so long i gather my billion thoughts into science and my million wills into a common purpose well may you slink down behind the mountains from me well may you cower section karenin desired that he might dream alone for a little while before he returned to the cell in which he was to sleep he was given relief for a pain that began to trouble him and wrapped warmly about with furs for a great coldness was creeping over all things and so they left him and he sat for a long time watching the afterglow give place to the darkness of night it seemed to those who had to watch over him unobtrusively lest he should be in want of any attention that he mused very deeply the white and purple peaks against the golden sky sank down into cold blue remoteness glowed out again and faded again and the burning cressets of the indian stars that even the moonrise cannot altogether quench began their vigil the moon rose behind the towering screen of dark precipices to the east and long before it emerged above these its slanting beams had filled the deep gorges below with luminous mist and turned the towers and pinnacles of lio porgyul to a magic dreamcastle of radiance and wonder chapter ii the bondage the days were thronged with experience for white fang during the time that kiche was tied by the stick he ran about over all the camp inquiring investigating learning he quickly came to know much of the ways of the but familiarity did not breed contempt the more he came to know them the more they vindicated their superiority the more they displayed their mysterious powers the greater loomed their to man has been given the grief often of seeing his gods overthrown and his altars crumbling but to the wolf and the wild dog that have come in to crouch at man's feet this grief has never come unlike man whose gods are of the unseen and the overguessed vapours and mists of fancy eluding the garmenture of reality wandering wraiths of desired goodness and power intangible of self into the realm of spirit unlike man the wolf and the wild dog that have come in to the fire find their gods in the living flesh solid to the touch occupying and requiring time for the accomplishment of their ends and their existence no effort of faith is necessary to believe in such a god no effort of will can possibly induce disbelief in such a god there is no getting away from it there it stands on its two club in hand immensely potential passionate and wrathful and loving god and mystery and power all wrapped up and around by flesh that bleeds when it is torn and that is good to eat like any flesh and so it was with white fang the were gods unmistakable and unescapable as his mother kiche had rendered her allegiance to them at the first cry of her name so he was beginning to render his allegiance he gave them the trail as a privilege indubitably theirs when they walked he got out of their way when they called he came when they threatened he cowered down when they commanded him to go he went away hurriedly for behind any wish of theirs was power to enforce that wish power that hurt power that expressed itself in clouts and clubs in flying stones and stinging lashes of whips he belonged to them as all dogs belonged to them his actions were theirs to command his body was theirs to maul to stamp upon to tolerate such was the lesson that was quickly borne in upon him it came hard going as it did counter to much that was strong and dominant in his own nature and while he disliked it in the learning of it unknown to himself he was learning to like it it was a placing of his destiny in another's hands a shifting of the responsibilities of existence this in itself was compensation for it is always easier to lean upon another than to stand alone but it did not all happen in a day this giving over of himself body and soul to the he could not immediately forego his wild heritage and his memories of the wild there were days when he crept to the edge of the forest and stood and listened to something calling him far and away and always he returned restless and uncomfortable to whimper softly and wistfully at kiche's side and to lick her face with eager questioning tongue white fang learned rapidly the ways of the camp he knew the injustice and greediness of the older dogs when meat or fish was thrown out to be eaten he came to know that men were more just children more cruel and women more kindly and more likely to toss him a bit of meat or bone and after two or three painful adventures with the mothers of puppies he came into the knowledge that it was always good policy to let such mothers alone to keep away from them as far as possible and to avoid them when he saw them coming but the bane of his life was larger older and stronger lip lip had selected white fang for his special object of persecution while fang fought willingly enough but he was outclassed his enemy was too big became a nightmare to him whenever he ventured away from his mother the bully was sure to appear trailing at his heels snarling at him picking upon him and watchful of an opportunity when no man animal was near to spring upon him and force a fight as invariably won he enjoyed it hugely it became his chief delight in life as it became white fang's chief torment but the effect upon white fang was not to cow him though he suffered most of the damage and was always defeated his spirit remained unsubdued yet a bad effect was produced he became malignant and morose his temper had been savage by birth but it became more savage under this unending persecution the genial playful puppyish side of him found little expression he never played and gambolled about with the other puppies of the camp would not permit it the moment white fang appeared near them was upon him bullying and hectoring him or fighting with him until he had driven him away the devil's trade mark one day when john and i had been out on some business of our master's and were returning gently on a long straight road at some distance we saw a boy trying to leap a pony over a gate the pony would not take the leap and the boy cut him with the whip but he only turned off on one side he whipped him again but the pony turned off on the other side then the boy got off and gave him a hard thrashing and knocked him about the head then he got up again and tried to make him leap the gate kicking him all the time shamefully but still the pony refused when we were nearly at the spot the pony put down his head and threw up his heels and sent the boy neatly over into a broad quickset hedge and with the rein dangling from his head he set off home at a full gallop john laughed out quite loud served him right he said oh oh oh cried the boy as he struggled about among the thorns i say come and help me out thank ye said john i think you are quite in the right place and maybe a little scratching will teach you not to leap a pony over a gate that is too high for him and so with that john rode off it may be said he to himself that young fellow is a liar as well as a cruel one we'll just go home by farmer bushby's beauty and then if anybody wants to know you and i can tell em ye see so we turned off to the right and soon came up to the and within sight of the house the farmer was hurrying out into the road and his wife was standing at the gate looking very frightened have you seen my boy said mr bushby as we came up he went out an hour ago on my black pony and the creature is just come back without a rider i should think sir said john he had better be without a rider unless he can be ridden properly what do you mean said the farmer well sir i saw your son whipping and kicking and knocking that good little pony about shamefully because he would not leap a gate that was too high for him the pony behaved well sir and showed no vice but at last he just threw up his heels and tipped the young gentleman into the thorn hedge he wanted me to help him out but i hope you will excuse me sir i did not feel inclined to do so there's no bones broken sir he'll only get a few scratches i love horses and it riles me to see them badly used it is a bad plan to aggravate an animal till he uses his heels the first time is not always the last during this time the mother began to cry oh my poor bill i must go and meet him he must be hurt you had better go into the house wife said the farmer bill wants a lesson about this and i must see that he gets it this is not the first time nor the second that he has that pony and i shall stop it i am much obliged to you manly so we went on john chuckling all the way home then he told james about it who laughed and said serve him right i knew that boy at school he took great airs on himself because he was a farmer's son he used to swagger about and bully the little boys of course we elder ones would not have any of that nonsense and let him know that in the school and the playground farmers sons and laborers sons were all alike i well remember one day just before afternoon school i found him at the large window catching flies and pulling off their wings he did not see me and i gave him a box on the ears that laid him sprawling on the floor well angry as i was i was almost frightened he roared and bellowed in such a style the boys rushed in from the playground and the master ran in from the road to see who was being murdered of course i said fair and square at once what i had done and why then i showed the master the flies some crushed and some crawling about helpless and i showed him the wings on the window sill i never saw him so angry before but as bill was still howling and whining like the coward that he was he did not give him any more punishment of that kind but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon and said that he should not go out to play for that week then he talked to all the boys very seriously about cruelty and said how and cowardly it was to hurt the weak and the helpless but what stuck in my mind was this he said that cruelty was the devil's own and if we saw any one who took pleasure in cruelty we might know who he belonged to for the devil was a murderer from the beginning and a tormentor to the end on the other hand where we saw people who loved their neighbors and were kind to man and beast we might know that was god's mark chapter xxii a week is gone le jour des noces arrived the marriage was solemnized at st jacques mdlle zoraide became madame pelet nee reuter and in about an hour after this transformation the happy pair as newspapers phrase it were on their way to paris where according to previous arrangement the honeymoon was to be spent the next day i quitted the pensionnat myself and my chattels some books and clothes were soon transferred to a modest lodging i had hired in a street not far off in half an hour my clothes were arranged in a commode my books on a shelf and the flitting was effected i should not have been unhappy that day had not one pang tortured me a longing to go to the rue notre dame aux neiges resisted yet irritated by an inward resolve to avoid that street till such time as the mist of doubt should clear from my prospects it was a sweet september evening very mild very still i had nothing to do at that hour i knew frances would be equally released from occupation i thought she might possibly be wishing for her master i knew i wished for my pupil imagination began with her low whispers infusing into my soul the soft tale of pleasures that might be you will find her reading or writing said she you can take your seat at her side you need not startle her peace by undue excitement you need not embarrass her manner by unusual action or language be as you always are look over what she has written listen while she reads chide her or quietly approve you know the effect of either system you know her smile when pleased you know the play of her looks when roused you have the secret of awakening what expression you will and you can choose amongst that pleasant variety with you she will sit silent as long as it suits you to talk alone you can hold her under a potent spell intelligent as she is eloquent as she can be you can seal her lips and veil her bright countenance with diffidence yet you know she is not all monotonous mildness you have seen with a sort of strange pleasure revolt scorn austerity bitterness lay energetic claim to a place in her feelings and physiognomy you know that few could rule her as you do you know she might break but never bend under the hand of tyranny and injustice but reason and affection can guide her by a sign try their influence now go they are not passions you may handle them safely i will not go was my answer to the sweet temptress a man is master of himself to a certain point but not beyond it could i seek frances could i sit with her alone in a quiet room and address her only in the language of reason and affection no was the brief fervent reply of that love which had conquered and now controlled me time seemed to stagnate the sun would not go down my watch ticked but i thought the hands were paralyzed what a hot evening i cried throwing open the lattice for indeed i had seldom felt so feverish hearing a step ascending the common stair i wondered whether the locataire now mounting to his apartments were as unsettled in mind and condition as i was or whether he lived in the calm of certain resources and in the freedom of unfettered feelings what was he coming in person to solve the problem hardly proposed in inaudible thought he had actually knocked at the door at my door a smart prompt rap and almost before i could invite him in he was over the threshold and had closed the door behind him and how are you asked an indifferent quiet voice in the english language while my visitor without any sort of bustle or introduction put his hat on the table and his gloves into his hat and drawing the only armchair the room afforded a little forward seated himself tranquilly therein you speak he inquired in a few moments in a tone whose nonchalance seemed to intimate that it was much the same thing whether i answered or not the fact is i found it desirable to have recourse to my good friends les besicles not exactly to ascertain the identity of my visitor for i already knew him confound his impudence but to see how he looked to get a clear notion of his mien and countenance i wiped the glasses very deliberately and put them on quite as deliberately adjusting them so as not to hurt the bridge of my nose or get entangled in my short tufts of dun hair i was sitting in the with my back to the light and i had him a position he would much rather have had reversed for at any time he preferred scrutinizing to being scrutinized yes it was he and no mistake with his six feet of length arranged in a sitting attitude with his dark travelling surtout with its velvet collar his gray pantaloons his black stock and his face the most original one nature ever modelled yet the least obtrusively so not one feature that could be termed marked or odd yet the effect of the whole unique there is no use in attempting to describe what is indescribable being in no hurry to address him i sat and stared at my ease chapter ii the law of club and fang first day on the dyea beach was like a nightmare every hour was filled with shock and surprise he had been suddenly jerked from the heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial no lazy life was this with nothing to do but loaf and be bored here was neither peace nor rest nor a safety all was confusion and action and every moment life and limb were in peril there was imperative need to be constantly alert for these dogs and men were not town dogs and men they were savages all of them who knew no law but the law of club and fang he had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought and his first experience taught him an unforgetable lesson it is true it was a vicarious experience else he would not have lived to profit by it curly was the victim they were camped near the log store where she in her friendly way made advances to a husky dog the size of a wolf though not half so large as she there was no warning only a leap in like a flash a metallic clip of teeth a leap out equally swift and face was ripped open from eye to jaw it was the wolf manner of fighting to strike and leap away but there was more to it than this thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and surrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle buck did not comprehend that silent intentness nor the eager way with which they were licking their chops curly rushed her antagonist who struck again and leaped aside he met her next rush with his chest in a peculiar fashion that tumbled her off her feet she never regained them this was what the onlooking huskies had waited for they closed in upon her snarling and yelping and she was buried screaming with agony beneath the bristling mass of bodies so sudden was it and so unexpected that buck was taken aback he saw spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing and he saw françois swinging an axe spring into the mess of dogs three men with clubs were helping him to scatter them it did not take long two minutes from the time curly went down the last of her assailants were clubbed off but she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody trampled snow almost literally torn to pieces the swart standing over her and cursing horribly the scene often came back to buck to trouble him in his sleep so that was the way no fair play once down that was the end of you well he would see to it that he never went down spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again and from that moment buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing of curly he received another shock françois fastened upon him an arrangement of straps and buckles it was a harness such as he had seen the grooms put on the horses at home and as he had seen horses work so he was set to work hauling françois on a sled to the forest that fringed the valley and returning with a load of firewood though his dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal he was too wise to rebel he buckled down with a will and did his best though it was all new and strange françois was stern demanding instant obedience and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience while dave who was an experienced wheeler nipped hind quarters whenever he was in error spitz was the leader likewise experienced and while he could not always get at buck he growled sharp reproof now and again or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk buck into the way he should go buck learned easily and under the combined tuition of his two mates and françois made remarkable progress ere they returned to camp he knew enough to stop at ho to go ahead at mush to swing wide on the bends and to keep clear of the wheeler when the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels vair good dogs françois told perrault dat buck heem pool lak hell i tich heem queek as by afternoon perrault who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his despatches returned with two more dogs billee and joe he called them two brothers and true huskies both sons of the one mother though they were they were as different as day and night one fault was his excessive good nature while joe was the very opposite sour and introspective with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye buck received them in comradely fashion dave ignored them while spitz proceeded to thrash first one and then the other billee wagged his tail appeasingly turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail and cried still appeasingly when sharp teeth scored his flank but no matter how spitz circled joe whirled around on his heels to face him mane bristling ears laid back lips writhing and snarling jaws clipping together as fast as he could snap and eyes diabolically gleaming the incarnation of belligerent fear so terrible was his appearance that spitz was forced to forego disciplining him but to cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing billee and drove him to the confines of the camp chapter viii the next few months passed away as many years can pass away without definite events and yet if suddenly disturbed it would be seen that such months or years had a character unlike others the three months which had passed had brought them to the beginning of march the climate had kept its promise and the change of season from winter to spring had made very little difference so that helen who was sitting in the with a pen in her hand could keep the windows open though a great fire of logs burnt on one side of her below the sea was still blue and the roofs still brown and white though the day was fading rapidly it was dusk in the room which large and empty at all times now appeared larger and emptier than usual her own figure as she sat writing with a pad on her knee shared the general effect of size and lack of detail for the flames which ran along the branches suddenly devouring little green tufts burnt intermittently and sent irregular illuminations across her face and the plaster walls there were no pictures on the walls but here and there boughs laden with flowers spread widely against them of the books fallen on the bare floor and heaped upon the large table it was only possible in this light to trace the outline mrs ambrose was writing a very long letter beginning dear bernard it went on to describe what had been happening in the villa san gervasio during the past three months as for instance that they had had the british consul to dinner and had been taken over a spanish and had seen a great many processions and religious festivals which were so beautiful that mrs ambrose couldn't conceive why if people must have a religion they didn't all become roman catholics they had made several expeditions though none of any length it was worth coming if only for the sake of the flowering trees which grew wild quite near the house and the amazing colours of sea and earth the earth instead of being brown was red purple green you won't believe me she added there is no colour like it in england she adopted indeed a condescending tone towards that poor island which was now advancing chilly crocuses and nipped violets in nooks in copses in cosy corners tended by rosy old gardeners in mufflers who were always touching their hats and bobbing obsequiously she went on to deride the islanders themselves rumours of london all in a ferment over a general election had reached them even out here it seems incredible she went on that people should care whether asquith is in or austen chamberlain out and while you scream yourselves hoarse about politics you let the only people who are trying for something good starve or simply laugh at them when have you ever encouraged a living artist or bought his best work why are you all so ugly and so servile here the servants are human beings they talk to one as if they were equals as far as i can tell there are no aristocrats perhaps it was the mention of aristocrats that reminded her of richard dalloway and rachel for she ran on with the same penful to describe her niece it's an odd fate that has put me in charge of a girl she wrote considering that i have never got on well with women or had much to do with them however i must retract some of the things that i have said against them if they were properly educated i don't see why they shouldn't be much the same as men as satisfactory i mean though of course very different the question is how should one educate them the present method seems to me abominable this girl though had never heard that men desired women and until i explained it did not know how children were born her ignorance upon other matters as important here mrs ambrose's letter may not be quoted was complete it seems to me not merely foolish but criminal to bring people up like that let alone the suffering to them it explains why women are what they are the wonder is they're no worse i have taken it upon myself to enlighten her and now though still a good deal prejudiced and liable to exaggerate she is more or less a reasonable human being keeping them ignorant of course defeats its own object and when they begin to understand they take it all much too seriously my really deserved a catastrophe which he won't get i now pray for a young man to come to my help some one i mean who would talk to her openly and prove how absurd most of her ideas about life are unluckily such men seem almost as rare as the women the english colony certainly doesn't provide one artists merchants cultivated people they are stupid conventional and flirtatious she ceased and with her pen in her hand sat looking into the fire making the logs into caves and mountains for it had grown too dark to go on writing moreover the house began to stir as the hour of dinner approached she could hear the plates being chinked in the next door and chailey instructing the spanish girl where to put things down in vigorous english the bell rang she rose met ridley and rachel outside and they all went in to dinner a gilded opportunity although the whole fabric of rena's new life toppled and fell with her lover's defection her sympathies broadened by culture and still more by her recent emotional experience did not shrink as would have been the case with a more selfish soul to the mere limits of her personal sorrow great as this seemed at the moment she had learned to love and when the love of one man failed her she turned to humanity as a stream obstructed in its course overflows the adjacent country her early training had not directed her thoughts to the darker people with whose fate her own was bound up so closely but rather away from them she had been taught to despise them because they were not so white as she was and had been slaves while she was free her life in her brother's home by removing her from immediate contact with them had given her a different point of view one which emphasized their shortcomings and thereby made vastly clearer to her the gulf that separated them from the new world in which she lived so that when misfortune threw her back upon them the reaction brought her nearer than before where once she had seemed able to escape from them they were now it appeared her inalienable race thus doubly equipped she was able to view them at once with the mental eye of an outsider and the sympathy of a sister she could see their faults and judge them charitably she knew and appreciated their good qualities with her quickened intelligence she could perceive how great was their need and how small their opportunity and with this illumination came the desire to contribute to their help she had not the breadth or culture to see in all its ramifications the great problem which still puzzles statesmen and philosophers but she was conscious of the wish and of the power in a small way to do something for the advancement of those who had just set their feet upon the ladder of progress this desire to be of service to her rediscovered people was not long without an opportunity for expression yet the fates willed that her future should be but another link in a connected chain she was to be as powerless to put aside her recent past as she had been to escape from the influence of her earlier life there are sordid souls that eat and drink and breed and die and imagine they have lived but rena's life since her great awakening had been that of the emotions and her temperament made of it a continuous life her successive states of consciousness were not detachable but united to form a single if not an entirely harmonious whole to her sensitive spirit was born of yesterday would be but the offspring of to day one day along toward noon her mother received a visit from mary b pettifoot a second cousin who lived on back street only a short distance from the house behind the cedars rena had gone out so that the visitor found mis molly alone i heared you say cousin molly said mary b no one ever knew what the b in mary's name stood for it was a mere ornamental flourish that rena was talkin bout teachin school i've got a good chance fer her ef she keers ter take it my cousin jeff wain rived in town this mo'nin f'm way down in sampson county ter git a teacher fer the nigger school in his deestric i s'pose he mought a got one f'm roun newbern er goldsboro er some er them places eas but he lowed he'd like to visit some er his kin an ole frien's an so kill two birds with one stone i seed a strange mulatter man with a bay hoss an a new buggy drivin by here this mo'nin early from down to'ds the river rejoined mis molly i wonder if that wuz him did he have on a linen duster asked mary b yas an peared to be a very well sot up man replied mis molly bout years old i should reckon that wuz him assented mary b he's got a fine hoss an buggy an a gol watch an chain an a big plantation an lots er hosses an mules an cows an hawgs he raise fifty bales er cotton las year an he's be'n ter the legislatur my gracious exclaimed mis molly struck with awe at this catalogue of the stranger's possessions he was evidently worth more than a great many rich white people all white people in north carolina in those days were either rich or poor the distinction being one of caste rather than of wealth is he married she inquired with interest no single you mought low it was quare that he should n be married at his age but he was crossed in love oncet mary b heaved a sigh an has stayed single ever sence that wuz ten years ago but as some husban's is an there ain no mo chance fer im now than there wuz then i reckon some nice gal mought stan a good show er ketchin im ef she'd play her kyards right chapter i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel's family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk do you really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment upon my word said mrs gardiner i begin to be of your uncle's opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case in the first place replied mr gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland oh but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptional purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by jane's account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attraction has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father's behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so very ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would think capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating and do you really know all this cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her a vision of sandy blight i'd been humping my back and crouching and groaning for an hour or so in the darkest corner of the travellers hut tortured by the demon of sandy blight it was too hot to travel and there was no one there except ourselves and mitchell's cattle pup we were waiting till after sundown for i couldn't have travelled in the daylight anyway mitchell had tied a wet towel round my eyes and led me for the last mile or two by another towel one end fastened to his belt behind and the other in my hand as i walked in his tracks and oh but this was a relief it was out of the dust and glare and the flies didn't come into the dark hut and i could hump and stick my knees in my eyes and groan in comfort i didn't want a thousand a year or anything i only wanted relief for my eyes that was all i prayed for in this world when the sun got down a bit mitchell started poking round and presently he found amongst the rubbish a medicine bottle corked tight when he rubbed the dirt off a piece of notepaper that was pasted on he saw written on it he drew the cork with his teeth smelt the water stuck his little finger in turned the bottle upside down tasted the top of his finger and reckoned the stuff was all right here wake up joe he shouted here's a bottle of tears a bottler wot i groaned said mitchell are you sure it's all right i didn't want to be poisoned or have my eyes burnt out by mistake perhaps some burning acid had got into that bottle or the label had been put on or left on in mistake or carelessness i dunno said mitchell but there's no harm in tryin i chanced it i lay down on my back in a bunk and mitchell dragged my lids up and spilt half a bottle of over my the relief was almost instantaneous i never experienced such a quick cure in my life i carried the bottle in my swag for a long time afterwards with an idea of getting it analysed but left it behind at last in a camp mitchell scratched his head thoughtfully and watched me for a while i think i'll wait a bit longer he said at last and if it doesn't blind you i'll put some in my eyes i'm getting a touch of blight myself now that's the fault of travelling with a mate who's always catching something that's no good to him as it grew dark outside we talked of and and up north and ordinary flies and branched off to barcoo rot and struck the track again at bees and bee stings when we got to bees mitchell sat smoking for a while and looking dreamily backwards along tracks and branch tracks and round corners and circles he had travelled right back to the short narrow innocent bit of track that ends in a vague misty point like the end of a long straight cleared road in the moonlight as far back as we can remember i had about fourteen hives said mitchell we used to call them swarms no matter whether they were flying or in the box when i left home first time i kept them behind the shed in the shade on tables of galvanised iron cases turned down on stakes but i had to make legs later on and stand them in pans of water on account of the ants when the bees swarmed and some hives sent out the lord knows how many swarms in a year it seemed to me we'd em and throw water on em to make em believe the biggest thunderstorm was coming to drown the oldest inhabitant and if they didn't get the start of us and rise they'd settle on a branch generally on one of the scraggy fruit trees it was rough on the bees come to think of it their instinct told them it was going to be fine and the noise and water told them it was raining they must have thought that nature was mad drunk or gone ratty or the end of the world had come we'd rig up a table with a box upside down under the branch cover our face with a piece of mosquito net have rags burning round and then give the branch a sudden jerk turn the box down and run if we got most of the bees in the rest that were hanging to the bough or flying round would follow and then we reckoned we'd shook the queen in if the bees in the box came out and joined the others we'd reckon we hadn't shook the queen in and go for them again when a hive was full of honey we'd turn the box upside down turn the empty box mouth down on top of it and drum and hammer on the lower box with a stick till all the bees went up into the top box i suppose it made their heads ache and they went up on that account xiv bandits when madeline and her party recovered composure they sat up to watch the finish of the match it came with spectacular suddenness a sharp yell pealed out and all the cowboys turned attentively in its direction a big black horse had surmounted the rim of the mesa and was just breaking into a run his rider yelled sharply to the cowboys they wheeled to dash toward their grazing horses that's stewart there is something wrong said madeline in alarm castleton stared the other men exclaimed uneasily the women sought madeline's face with anxious eyes the black got into his stride and bore swiftly down upon them oh look at that horse run cried helen look at that fellow ride helen was not alone in her admiration for madeline divided her emotions between growing alarm of some danger menacing and a thrill and quickening of that tingled over her whenever she saw stewart in violent action no action of his was any longer insignificant but violent action meant so much it might mean anything for one moment she remembered stillwell and all his talk about fun and plots and tricks to amuse her guest then she discountenanced the thought stewart might lend himself to a little fun but he cared too much for a horse to run him at that speed unless there was imperious need that alone sufficed to answer madeline's questioning curiosity and her alarm mounted to fear not so much for herself as for her guests but what danger could there be she could think of nothing except the guerrillas whatever threatened it would be met and checked by this man stewart who was thundering up on his fleet horse and as he neared her so that she could see the dark gleam of face and eyes she had a strange feeling of trust in her dependence upon him the big black was so close to madeline and her friends that when stewart pulled him the dust and sand kicked up by his pounding hoofs flew in their faces oh stewart what is it cried madeline guess i scared you miss hammond he replied but i'm pressed for time there's a gang of bandits hiding on the ranch most likely in a deserted hut they held up a train near agua prieta pat hawe is with the posse that's trailing them and you know pat has no use for us i'm afraid it wouldn't be pleasant for you or your guests to meet either the posse or the bandits i fancy not said madeline considerably relieved we'll hurry back to the house they exchanged no more speech at the moment and madeline's guests were silent perhaps stewart's actions and looks belied his calm words his piercing eyes roved round the rim of the mesa and his face was as hard and stern as chiseled bronze monty and nick came galloping up each leading several horses by the bridles nels appeared behind them with majesty and he was having trouble with the roan madeline observed that all the other cowboys had disappeared one sharp word from stewart calmed madeline's horse the other horses however were frightened and not inclined to stand the men mounted without trouble and likewise madeline and florence but edith wayne and mrs beck being nervous and almost helpless were with difficulty gotten into the saddle beg pardon but i'm pressed for time said stewart coolly as with iron arm he forced dorothy's horse almost to its knees dorothy who was active and plucky climbed astride and when stewart loosed his hold on bit and mane the horse doubled up and began to buck dorothy screamed as she shot into the air stewart as quick as the horse leaped forward and caught dorothy in his arms she had slipped head downward and had he not caught her would have had a serious fall stewart handling her as if she were a child turned her right side up to set her upon her feet dorothy evidently thought only of the spectacle she presented and made startled motions to readjust her it was no time to laugh though madeline felt as if she wanted to besides it was impossible to be anything but sober with stewart in violent mood for he had jumped at dorothy's stubborn mount all cowboys were masters of horses it was wonderful to see him conquer the vicious animal he was cruel perhaps yet it was from necessity when presently he led the horse back to dorothy she mounted without further trouble meanwhile nels and nick had lifted helen into her saddle we'll take the side trail said stewart shortly as he swung upon the big black then he led the way and the other cowboys trotted in the rear it was only a short distance to the rim of the mesa and when madeline saw the steep trail narrow and choked with weathered stone she felt that her guests would certainly flinch that's a jolly bad course observed castleton the women appeared to be speechless stewart checked his horse at the deep cut where the trail started down boys drop over and go slow he said dismounting flo you follow now ladies let your horses loose and hold on lean forward and hang to the pommel it looks bad but the horses are used to such trails chapter anne went home to think over all that she had heard in one point her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him he stood as opposed to captain wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness and the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief he might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed pity for him was all over but this was the only point of relief in every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward she saw more to distrust and to apprehend she was concerned for the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing how to avert any one of them she was most thankful for her own knowledge of him she had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like mrs smith but here was a reward indeed springing from it mrs smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done could the knowledge have been extended through her family but this was a vain idea she must talk to lady russell tell her consult with her and having done her best wait the event with as much composure as possible and after all her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself she found on reaching home that she had as she intended escaped seeing mr elliot that he had called and paid them a long morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herself and felt safe when she heard that he was coming again in the evening i had not the smallest intention of asking him said elizabeth with affected carelessness but he gave so many hints so mrs clay says at least indeed i do say it i never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation poor man i was really in pain for him for your sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty oh cried elizabeth i have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints however when i found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit an opportunity of bringing him and sir walter together they appear to so much advantage in company with each other each behaving so pleasantly mr elliot looking up with so much respect quite delightful cried mrs clay not daring however to turn her eyes towards anne exactly like father and son dear miss elliot may i not say father and son oh i lay no embargo on any body's words if you will have such ideas but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men my dear miss elliot exclaimed mrs clay lifting her hands and eyes and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence well my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him i did invite him you know i sent him away with smiles when i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park for the whole day i had compassion on him anne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shew such pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate the sight of mr elliot and yet she could assume a most obliging placid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have done otherwise to anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her she had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere but now she saw insincerity in everything his attentive deference to her father contrasted with his former language was odious and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness or the sound of his artificial good sentiments she meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side it was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship and to retrace as quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along she was accordingly more guarded and more cool than she had been the night before he wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation but the charm was broken he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin's vanity he found at least that it was not to be done now by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the claims of the others he little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable january a happy new year to you all my dearest family which of course includes mr l and a young man by the name of teddy i can't tell you how much i enjoyed your christmas bundle for i didn't get it till night and had given up hoping your letter came in the morning but you said nothing about a parcel meaning it for a surprise so i was disappointed for i'd had a kind of feeling that you wouldn't forget me i felt a little low in my mind as i sat up in my room after tea and when the big muddy bundle was brought to me i just hugged it and pranced it was so homey and refreshing that i sat down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried in my usual absurd way the things were just what i wanted and all the better for being made instead of bought beth's new ink bib was capital and hannah's box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure i'll be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent marmee and read carefully the books father has marked thank you all heaps and heaps speaking of books reminds me that i'm getting rich in that line for on new year's day mr bhaer gave me a fine shakespeare it is one he values much and i've often admired it set up in the place of honor with his german bible plato homer and milton so you may imagine how i felt when he brought it down without its cover and showed me my own name in it from my friend friedrich bhaer you say often you wish a library here i gif you one for between these lids he meant covers is many books in one read him well and he will help you much for the study of character in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen i thanked him as well as i could and talk now about my library as if i had a hundred books i never knew how much there was in shakespeare before but then i never had a bhaer to explain it to me now don't laugh at his horrid name it isn't pronounced either bear or beer as people will say it but something between the two as only germans can give it i'm glad you both like what i tell you about him and hope you will know him some day mother would admire his warm heart father his wise head i admire both and feel rich in my new friend friedrich bhaer not having much money or knowing what he'd like i got several little things and put them about the room where he would find them unexpectedly they were useful pretty or funny a new standish on his table a little vase for his flower he always has one or a bit of green in a glass to keep him fresh he says and a holder for his blower so that he needn't burn up what amy calls mouchoirs i made it like those beth invented a big butterfly with a fat body and black and yellow wings worsted feelers and bead eyes it took his fancy immensely and he put it on his mantlepiece as an article of virtue so it was rather a failure after all poor as he is he didn't forget a servant or a child in the house and not a soul here from the french laundrywoman to miss norton forgot him i was so glad of that they got up a masquerade and had a gay time new year's eve i didn't mean to go down having no dress but at the last minute mrs kirke remembered some old brocades and miss norton lent me lace and feathers so i dressed up as mrs malaprop and sailed in with a mask on no one knew me for i disguised my voice and no one dreamed of the silent haughty miss march for they think i am very stiff and cool most of them and so i am to whippersnappers could dance and dress and burst out into a nice derangement of epitaphs like an allegory on the banks of the nile i enjoyed it very much and when we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me i heard one of the young men tell another that he knew i'd been an actress in fact he thought he remembered seeing me at one of the minor theaters meg will relish that joke mr bhaer was nick bottom and tina was titania a perfect little fairy in his arms to see them dance was quite a landscape to use a teddyism i had a very happy new year after all and when i thought it over in my room i felt as if i was getting on a little in spite of my many failures for i'm cheerful all the time now work with a will and take more interest in other people than i used to which is satisfactory bless you all ever your loving jo the eye of apollo that singular smoky sparkle at once a confusion and a transparency which is the strange secret of the thames was changing more and more from its grey to its glittering extreme as the sun climbed to the zenith over westminster and two men crossed westminster bridge one man was very tall and the other very short they might even have been fantastically compared to the arrogant of parliament and the humbler humped shoulders of the abbey for the short man was in clerical dress the official description of the tall man was m hercule flambeau private detective and he was going to his new offices in a new pile of flats facing the abbey entrance the official description of the short man was the reverend j brown attached to st francis church camberwell and he was coming from a camberwell deathbed to see the new offices of his friend the building was american in its altitude and american also in the oiled elaboration of its machinery of telephones and lifts but it was barely finished and still understaffed only three tenants had moved in the office just above flambeau was occupied as also was the office just below him the two floors above that and the three floors below were entirely bare but the first glance at the new tower of flats caught something much more arresting save for a few relics of scaffolding the one glaring object was erected outside the office just above it was an enormous gilt effigy of the human eye surrounded with rays of gold and taking up as much room as two or three of the office windows what on earth is that asked father brown and stood still oh a new religion said flambeau laughing one of those new religions that forgive your sins by saying you never had any rather like christian science i should think the fact is that a fellow calling himself kalon i know what his name is except that it be that has taken the flat just above me i have two lady typewriters underneath me and this enthusiastic old humbug on top he calls himself the new priest of apollo and he worships the sun let him look out said father brown the sun was the cruellest of all the gods but what does that monstrous eye mean as i understand it it is a theory of theirs answered flambeau that a man can endure anything if his mind is quite steady their two great symbols are the sun and the open eye for they say that if a man were really healthy he could stare at the sun if a man were really healthy said father brown he would not bother to stare at it well all i can tell you about the new religion went on flambeau carelessly it claims of course that it can cure all physical diseases can it cure the one spiritual disease asked father brown with a serious curiosity and what is the one spiritual disease asked flambeau smiling oh thinking one is quite well said his friend flambeau was more interested in the quiet little office below him than in the flamboyant temple above he was a lucid southerner incapable of conceiving himself as anything but a catholic or an atheist and new religions of a bright and pallid sort were not much in his line but humanity was always in his line especially when it was moreover the ladies downstairs were characters in their way the office was kept by two sisters both slight and dark one of them tall and striking she had a dark eager and aquiline profile and was one of those women whom one always thinks of in profile as of the edge of some weapon she seemed to cleave her way through life she had eyes of startling brilliancy but it was the brilliancy of steel rather than of diamonds and her straight slim figure was a shade too stiff for its grace her younger sister was like her shortened shadow a little greyer paler and more insignificant they both wore a black with little masculine cuffs and collars there are thousands of such curt strenuous ladies in the offices of london but the interest of these lay rather in their real than their apparent position for pauline stacey the elder was actually the heiress of a crest and half a county as well as great wealth she had been brought up in castles and gardens before a frigid fierceness peculiar to the modern woman had driven her to what she considered a harsher and a higher existence she had not indeed surrendered her money in that there would have been a romantic or monkish abandon quite alien to her masterful utilitarianism she held her wealth she would say for use upon practical social objects part of it she had put into her business the nucleus of a model typewriting emporium part of it was distributed in various leagues and causes for the advancement of such work among women how far joan her sister and partner shared this slightly prosaic idealism no one could be very sure but she followed her leader with a affection which was somehow more attractive with its touch of tragedy than the hard high spirits of the elder for pauline stacey had nothing to say to tragedy she was understood to deny its existence iii indisputably the most striking defect of this modern american literature is the fact that the production of anything at all resembling literature is scarcely anywhere apparent innumerable instead are turning out a vast quantity of the candidly recognized purpose of which is to kill time and which it has been asserted though perhaps too sweepingly ought not to be vended over but rather in drugstores along with the other narcotics it is begging the question to protest that the class of people who a generation ago read nothing now at least read novels and to regard this as a change for the better by similar logic it would be more wholesome to breakfast off laudanum than to omit the meal entirely the nineteenth century in fact by making education popular has produced in america the curious spectacle of a with essentially nonliterary tastes formerly better books were published because they were intended for persons who turned to reading through a natural bent of mind whereas the modern american novel of commerce is addressed to us average people who read when we read at all in violation of every innate instinct such grounds as yet exist for hopefulness on the part of those who cordially care for belles lettres are to be found elsewhere than in the crowded of fiction where genuine intelligence panders on all sides to ignorance and indolence the phrase may seem to have no very civil ring but reflection will assure the that two indispensable requisites nowadays of a pecuniarily successful novel are really that it make no demand upon the reader's imagination and that it rigorously refrain from assuming its reader to possess any particular information on any subject whatever the author who writes over the head of the public is the most dangerous enemy of his publisher and the most insidious as well because so many publishers are in private life interested in literary matters and would readily permit this personal foible to influence the exercise of their vocation were it possible to do so upon the preferable side of bankruptcy but publishers among innumerable other conditions must weigh the fact that no novel which does not deal with modern times is ever really popular among the it is difficult to imagine a tale whose action developed under the rule of the caesars or the merovingians being treated as more than a literary hors d'oeuvre we purchasers of vital novels know nothing about the period beyond a hazy association of it with the restrictions of the schoolroom our sluggish imaginations instinctively rebel against the exertion of forming any notion of such a period and all the human nature that exists even in persons is stirred up to resentment against the book's author for presuming to know more than a potential patron the book in fine simply irritates the person and she for it is only women who willingly brave the terrors of where most of our new books are bought nowadays quite naturally puts it aside in favor of some keen and daring study of american life that is warranted to grip the reader so modernity of scene is everywhere necessitated as an essential qualification for a book's discussion at the literary evenings of the local woman's club and modernity of scene of course is almost always fatal to the permanent worth of fictitious narrative it may seem banal here to recall the truism that art never reproduces its surroundings but such banality is often justified by our human proneness to shuffle over the fact that many truisms are true and this one is indisputable that what mankind has generally agreed to accept as art in any of the varied forms of fictitious narrative has never been a truthful reproduction of the artist's era indeed in the higher walks of fiction art has never reproduced anything but has always dealt with the facts and laws of life as so much crude material which must be transmuted into comeliness when shakespeare pronounced his celebrated dictum about art's holding the mirror up to nature he was no doubt alluding to the circumstance that a mirror reverses everything which it reflects nourishment for much wildish speculation in fact can be got by considering what the world's literature would be had its authors restricted themselves as do we americans so sedulously and unavoidably to writing of contemporaneous happenings in no author of the first class since homer's infancy has ever in his happier efforts concerned himself at all with the great problems of his particular day and among geniuses of the second rank you will find such ephemeralities adroitly utilized only when they are distorted into enduring parodies of their actual selves by the broad humor of a dickens or the colossal fantasy of a balzac in such cases as the latter two writers however we have an otherwise competent artist handicapped by a personality so marked that whatever he may nominally write about the result is above all else an exposure of the writer's idiosyncrasies then too the laws of any locale wherein mr pickwick achieves a competence in business or of a society wherein vautrin becomes chief of police are upon the face of it it suffices that as a general rule in the true artist finds an ample if restricted field wherein the proper functions of the preacher or the ventriloquist or the photographer or of the public prosecutor are exercised with equal lack of grace pierre grassou whenever you have gone to take a serious look at the exhibition of works of sculpture and painting such as it has been since the revolution of have you not been seized by a sense of uneasiness weariness sadness at the sight of those long and galleries since the true salon no longer exists the louvre has again been taken by assault this time by a populace of artists who have maintained themselves in it in other days when the salon presented only the choicest works of art it conferred the highest honor on the creations there exhibited among the two hundred selected paintings the public could still choose a crown was awarded to the masterpiece by hands unseen eager impassioned discussions arose about some picture the abuse showered on delacroix on ingres contributed no less to their fame than the praises and fanaticism of their adherents neither the crowd nor the criticism grows impassioned about the products of that bazaar forced to make the selection for itself which in former days the examining jury made for it the attention of the public is soon wearied and the exhibition closes before the year the pictures admitted never went beyond the first two columns of the long gallery of the old masters but in that year to the great astonishment of the public they filled the whole space historical genre paintings easel pictures landscapes flowers animals and these eight specialties could surely not offer more than twenty pictures in one year worthy of the eyes of the public which indeed cannot give its attention to a greater number of such works the more the number of artists increases the more careful and exacting the jury of admission ought to be the true character of the salon was lost as soon as it spread along the galleries the salon should have remained within fixed limits of inflexible proportions where each distinct specialty could show its masterpieces only an experience of ten years has shown the excellence of the former institution now instead of a tournament we have a mob instead of a noble exhibition we have a tumultuous bazaar instead of a choice selection we have a chaotic mass what is the result a great artist is swamped decamps turkish cafe children at a fountain joseph and the torture would have redounded far more to his credit if the four pictures had been exhibited in the great salon with the hundred good pictures of that year than his twenty pictures could among three thousand others jumbled together in six galleries by some strange contradiction ever since the doors are open to every one there has been much talk of unknown and unrecognized genius when twelve years earlier ingres courtesan and that of sigalon the medusa of gericault the massacre of scio by delacroix the baptism of henri iv by eugene deveria admitted by celebrated artists accused of jealousy showed the world in spite of the denials of criticism that young and vigorous palettes existed no such complaint was made now when the veriest dauber of canvas can send in his work the whole talk is of genius neglected where judgment no longer exists there is no longer anything judged but whatever artists may be doing now they will come back in time to the examination and selection which presents their works to the admiration of the crowd for whom they work without selection by the academy there will be no salon and without the salon art may perish ever since the catalogue has grown into a book many names have appeared in it which still remain in their native obscurity in spite of the ten or a dozen pictures attached to them among these names perhaps the most unknown to fame is that of an artist named pierre grassou coming from fougeres and called simply fougeres among his who at the present moment holds a place as the saying is in the sun and who suggested the rather bitter reflections by which this sketch of his life is introduced reflections that are applicable to many other individuals of the tribe of artists in fougeres lived in the rue de navarin on the fourth floor of one of those tall narrow houses which resemble the obelisk of luxor and possess an alley a dark little stairway with dangerous turnings three windows only on each floor and within the building a courtyard or to speak more correctly a square pit or well above the three or four rooms occupied by grassou of fougeres was his studio looking over to montmartre this studio was painted in for a background the floor was tinted brown and well frotted each chair was furnished with a bit of carpet bound round the edges the sofa simple enough was clean as that in the bedroom of some worthy bourgeoise all these things denoted the tidy ways of a small mind and the thrift of a poor man a bureau was there in which to put away the studio implements a table for breakfast a sideboard a secretary in short all the articles necessary to a painter neatly arranged and very clean the stove participated in this dutch cleanliness which was all the more visible because the pure and little changing light from the north flooded with its cold clear beams the vast apartment fougeres being merely a genre painter does not need the immense machinery and outfit which ruin historical painters he has never recognized within himself sufficient faculty to attempt and he therefore clings to easel painting xi next morning which was sunday she resumed operations about ten o'clock and the renewed work recalled the conversation which had accompanied it the night before and put her back into the same intractable temper that's the story about me in marygreen is it that i entrapped ee much of a catch you were lord send as she warmed she saw some of jude's dear ancient classics on a table where they ought not to have been laid i won't have them books here in the way she cried petulantly and seizing them one by one she began throwing them upon the floor leave my books alone he said you might have thrown them aside if you had liked but as to soiling them like that it is disgusting in the operation of making lard arabella's hands had become smeared with the hot grease and her fingers consequently left very perceptible imprints on the she continued deliberately to toss the books severally upon the floor till jude incensed beyond bearing caught her by the arms to make her leave off somehow in going so he loosened the fastening of her hair and it rolled about her ears let me go she said promise to leave the books alone she hesitated let me go she repeated promise after a pause i do jude relinquished his hold and she crossed the room to the door out of which she went with a set face and into the highway here she began to saunter up and down perversely pulling her hair into a worse disorder than he had caused and unfastening several buttons of her gown it was a fine sunday morning dry clear and frosty and the bells of alfredston church could be heard on the breeze from the north people were going along the road dressed in their holiday clothes they were mainly lovers such pairs as jude and arabella had been when they sported along the same track some months earlier these pedestrians turned to stare at the extraordinary spectacle she now presented bonnetless her dishevelled hair blowing in the wind her bodice apart her sleeves rolled above her elbows for her work and her hands reeking with melted fat one of the passers said in mock terror good lord deliver us see how he's served me she cried making me work sunday mornings when i ought to be going to my church and tearing my hair off my head and my gown off my back jude was exasperated and went out to drag her in by main force then he suddenly lost his heat illuminated with the sense that all was over between them and that it mattered not what she did or he her husband stood still regarding her their lives were ruined he thought ruined by the fundamental error of their matrimonial union that of having based a permanent contract on a temporary feeling which had no necessary connection with affinities that alone render a lifelong comradeship tolerable going to me on principle as your father your mother and your father's sister her husband she asked all you be a queer lot as husbands and wives jude fixed an arrested surprised look on her but she said no more and continued her saunter till she was tired he left the spot and after wandering vaguely a little while walked in the direction of marygreen here he called upon his whose infirmities daily increased aunt did my father my mother and my aunt her husband said jude abruptly sitting down by the fire she raised her ancient eyes under the rim of the bonnet that she always wore who's been telling you that she said i have heard it spoken of and want to know all you med so well i s'pose though your wife i reckon twas she must have been a fool to open up that there isn't much to know after all your father and mother couldn't get on together and they parted it was coming home from alfredston market when you were a baby on the hill by the brown house barn that they had their last difference and took leave of one another for the last time your mother soon afterwards died she drowned herself in short and your father went away with you to south wessex and never came here any more jude recalled his father's silence about north wessex and jude's mother never speaking of either till his dying day it was the same with your father's sister her husband offended her and she so disliked living with him afterwards that she went away to london with her little maid the fawleys were not made for wedlock it never seemed to sit well upon us there's sommat in our blood that won't take kindly to the notion of being bound to do what we do readily enough if not bound that's why you ought to have hearkened to me and not ha married where did father and mother part by the brown house did you say a little further on where the road to fenworth branches off and the handpost stands a gibbet once stood there not onconnected with our history but let that be in the dusk of that evening jude walked away from his old aunt's as if to go home but as soon as he reached the open down he struck out upon it till he came to a large round pond the frost continued though it was not particularly sharp and the larger stars overhead came out slow and flickering jude put one foot on the edge of the ice and then the other it cracked under his weight but this did not deter him he ploughed his way inward to the centre the ice making sharp noises as he went when just about the middle he looked around him and gave a jump the cracking repeated itself but he did not go down he jumped again but the cracking had ceased jude went back to the edge and stepped upon the ground chapter vi red kerry chief inspector kerry of the criminal investigation department stood before the empty grate of his cheerless office in new scotland yard one hand thrust into the pocket of his blue reefer jacket and the other twirling a malacca cane which was heavily and which must have excited the envy of every beholding it chief inspector kerry wore a very bowler hat having two ventilation holes conspicuously placed immediately above the band he wore this hat tilted forward and to the right red kerry wholly merited his sobriquet for the man was as red as fire his hair which he wore cropped close as a pugilist's was brilliantly red and so was his short wiry aggressive moustache his complexion was red and from beneath his straight red eyebrows he surveyed the world with a pair of unblinking intolerant eyes he never smoked in public as his taste inclined towards irish twist and a short clay pipe but he was addicted to the use of and as he chewed and he chewed incessantly he revealed a perfect row of large white and positively teeth high cheek bones and prominent maxillary muscles enhanced the truculence indicated by his chin but next to this truculence which was the first and most alarming trait to intrude itself upon the observer's attention the outstanding characteristic of chief inspector kerry was his compact neatness of no more than medium height but with shoulders like an acrobat he had slim straight legs and the feet of a dancing master his attire from the collar down to the neat black brogues was spotless his reefer jacket fitted him faultlessly but his trousers were cut so unfashionably narrow that the protuberant thigh muscles and the line of a highly developed calf could quite easily be discerned the hand twirling the cane was small but also muscular freckled and covered with light down red kerry was built on the lines of a whippet but carried the equipment of an irish terrier the telephone bell rang inspector kerry moved his square shoulders in a manner oddly suggestive of a wrestler laid the malacca cane on the mantleshelf and crossed to the table taking up the telephone yes he said and his voice was and imperious he listened for a moment very good sir he replaced the receiver took up a wet oilskin overall from the back of a chair and the cane from the mantleshelf then rolling from one corner of his mouth into the other he snapped off the electric light and walked from the room along the corridor he went with a lithe silent step moving from the hips and swinging his shoulders before a door marked private he paused from his waistcoat pocket he took a little silver convex mirror and surveyed himself critically therein he adjusted his neat tie replaced the mirror knocked at the door and entered the room of the assistant commissioner this important official was a man constructed on huge principles a man of military bearing having tired eyes and a bewildered manner he conveyed the impression that the collection of documents books telephones and other paraphernalia bestrewing his table had reduced him to a state of stupor he looked up wearily and met the fierce gaze of the chief inspector with a glance almost apologetic ah chief inspector kerry he said with vague surprise yes i told you to come really i ought to have been at home hours ago it's most unfortunate i have to do the work of three men this is your department is it not chief inspector he handed kerry a slip of paper at which the chief inspector stared fiercely murder rapped kerry sir lucien pyne yes sir i am still on duty his speech in moments of interest must have suggested to one overhearing him from an adjoining room for instance the operation of a telegraphic instrument he gave to every syllable the value of a rap and certain words he terminated with an audible snap of his teeth ah murmured the assistant commissioner yes divisional inspector somebody i cannot read the name has detained all the parties but you had better report at vine street it appears to be a big case he sighed wearily very good sir with your permission i will glance at sir lucien's pedigree certainly certainly said the assistant commissioner waving one large hand in the direction of a bookshelf kerry crossed the room laid his oilskin and cane upon a chair and from the shelf where it reposed took a squat volume the assistant commissioner hand pressed to brow began to study a document which lay before him here we are said kerry sotto voce pyne sir lucien st aubyn fourth baronet son of general sir christian pyne h'm born malta oriel college first in classics h'm blue india burma contested wigan attached british legation h'm he returned the book to its place took up his overall and cane and very good sir he said i will proceed to vine street certainly certainly murmured the assistant commissioner glancing up absently good night good night sir oh chief inspector kerry turned his hand on the sir i er what was i going to say oh yes the social importance of the murdered man raises the case from the er you follow me public interest will become acute no doubt i have therefore selected you for your well known discretion i met sir lucien once very sad good night the pie and the sits by the fire how should she be fair in walks the little dog says pussy are you there how do you do mistress pussy mistress pussy how do you do i thank you kindly little dog i fare as well as you old rhyme once upon a time there was a called ribby who invited a little dog called duchess to tea come in good time my dear duchess said ribby's letter and we will have something so very nice i am baking it in a a with a pink rim you never tasted anything so good and you shall eat it all i will eat muffins my dear duchess wrote ribby duchess read the letter and wrote an answer i will come with much pleasure at a quarter past four but it is very strange i was just going to invite you to come here to supper my dear ribby to eat something most delicious i will come very punctually my dear ribby wrote duchess and then at the end she added i hope it isn't mouse and then she thought that did not look quite polite so she scratched out isn't mouse and changed it to i hope it will be fine and she gave her letter to the postman but she thought a great deal about ribby's pie and she read ribby's letter over and over again i am dreadfully afraid it will be mouse said duchess to herself i really couldn't couldn't eat mouse pie and i shall have to eat it because it is a party and my pie was going to be veal and ham a pink and white and so is mine just like ribby's dishes they were both bought at tabitha twitchit's duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it it is all ready to put into the oven such lovely and i put in a little tin to hold up the crust and i made a hole in the middle with a fork to let out the steam oh i do wish i could eat my own pie instead of a pie made of mouse duchess considered and considered and read ribby s letter again a pink and white you shall eat it all you means me then ribby is not going to even taste the pie herself a pink and white ribby is sure to go out to buy the muffins oh what a good idea why shouldn't i rush along and put my pie into ribby's oven when ribby isn't there duchess was quite delighted with her own cleverness ribby in the meantime had received duchess's answer and as soon as she was sure that the little dog would come she popped her pie into the oven there were two ovens one above the other some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open ribby put the pie into the lower oven the door was very stiff the top oven bakes too quickly said ribby to herself it is a pie of the most delicate and tender mouse minced up with bacon and i have taken out all the bones because duchess did nearly choke herself with a last time i gave a party she eats a little fast rather big mouthfuls but a most genteel and elegant little dog infinitely superior company to cousin tabitha twitchit ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth then she went out with a can to the well for water to fill up the kettle then she began to set the room in order for it was the as well as the kitchen she shook the mats out at the and put them straight the was a she dusted the clock and the ornaments on the mantelpiece and she polished and rubbed the tables and chairs then she spread a very clean white and set out her best china which she took out of a near the fireplace the were white with a pattern of pink roses and the were white and blue when ribby had laid the table she took a jug and a blue and white dish and went out down the field to the farm to fetch milk and butter when she came back she peeped into the bottom oven the pie looked very comfortable ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket to the village shop to buy a packet of tea a pound of lump sugar and a pot of marmalade and just at the same time duchess came out of her house at the other end of the village ribby met duchess own the street also carrying a basket covered with a cloth they only bowed to one another they did not speak because they were going to have a party as soon as duchess had got round the corner out of sight she simply ran straight away to ribby's house ribby went into the shop and bought what she required and came out after a pleasant gossip with cousin tabitha twitchit cousin tabitha was disdainful afterwards in conversation iii fawn the little missouri was in her spring fullness and the hills among which she found her way to the great muddy were profusely adorned with colors much like those worn by the wild red man upon a holiday looking toward the sunrise one saw mysterious deep shadows and bright prominences while on the opposite side there was really an extravagant array of variegated hues between the gorgeous buttes and ridges there were narrow plains broken here and there by dry creeks or gulches and these again were clothed scantily with poplars and bushes while the bare spots were purple with the wild dakota crocuses upon the lowest of a series of natural terraces there stood on this may morning a young sioux girl whose graceful movements were not unlike those of a doe which chanced to be lurking in a neighboring gulch on the upper plains not far away were her young companions all busily employed with the wewoptay as it was called the stick with which the sioux women dig wild turnips they were gayly gossiping together or each humming a as she worked only snana stood somewhat apart from the rest in fact concealed by the crest of the ridge she had paused in her digging and stood facing the buttes above them in the clear blue sky the father sun was traveling upward as in haste while to her receptive spirit there appealed an awful unknown force the silent speech of the great mystery to which it seemed to her the whole world must be listening o great mystery the father of earthly things is coming to quicken us into life have pity on me i pray thee may i some day become the mother of a great and brave race of warriors so the maiden prayed silently it was now day the sun shone hot upon the bare ground and the drops stood upon forehead as she plied her long pole there was a cool spring in the dry creek bed near by well hidden by a clump of chokecherry bushes and she turned thither to cool her thirsty throat in the depths of the ravine her eye caught a familiar footprint the track of a doe with the young fawn beside it the hunting instinct arose within it will be a great feat if i can find and take from her the babe the little tawny skin shall be beautifully dressed by my mother the legs and the nose shall be embossed with porcupine quills it will be my she said to herself as she stole forward on the fresh trail she scanned every nook every clump of bushes there was a sudden rustle from within a grove of wild plum trees thickly festooned with grape and clematis and the doe mother bounded away as carelessly as if she were never to return ah a ruse snana entered the thorny enclosure which was almost a rude teepee and tucked away in the furthermost corner lay something with a speckled tawny coat she bent over it the fawn was apparently sleeping presently its eyes moved a bit and a shiver passed through its subtle body thou shalt not die thy skin shall not become my unconsciously the maiden spoke the mother sympathy had taken hold on her mind she picked the fawn up tenderly bound its legs and put it on her back to carry like an indian babe in the folds of her robe i cannot leave you alone tachinchala your mother is not here our hunters will soon return by this road and your mother has left behind her two plain tracks leading to this thicket she murmured the wild creature struggled vigorously for a minute and then became quiet its graceful head protruded from the elkskin robe just over shoulder she was slowly climbing the slope with her burden when suddenly like an apparition the stood before her the fawn called loudly when it was first seized and the mother was not too far away to hear now she called frantically for her child at the same time stamping with her delicate yes sister you are right she is yours but you cannot save her the hunters will soon be here let me keep her for you i will return her to you safely and hear me o sister of the woods that some day i may become the mother of a noble race of warriors and of fine women as handsome as you are at this moment the quick eyes of the indian girl detected something strange in the actions she glanced in every direction and behold a grizzly bear was cautiously approaching the group from a considerable distance run run sister i shall save your child if i can she cried and flew for the nearest scrub oak on the edge of the bank up the tree she scrambled with the fawn still securely bound to her back the grizzly came on with teeth exposed and the in her flight came between him and the tree giving a series of indignant snorts as she ran and so distracted mato from his object of attack but only for a few seconds then on he came peter pan if you ask your mother whether she knew about peter pan when she was a little girl she will say why of course i did child and if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days she will say what a foolish question to ask certainly he did then if you ask your grandmother whether she knew about peter pan when she was a girl she also says why of course i did child but if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days she says she never heard of his having a goat perhaps she has forgotten just as she sometimes forgets your name and calls you mildred which is your name still she could hardly forget such an important thing as the goat therefore there was no goat when your grandmother was a little girl this shows that in telling the story of peter pan to begin with the goat as most people do is as silly as to put on your jacket before your vest of course it also shows that peter is ever so old but he is really always the same age so that does not matter in the least his age is one week and though he was born so long ago he has never had a birthday nor is there the slightest chance of his ever having one the reason is that he escaped from being a human when he was seven days old he escaped by the window and flew back to the kensington gardens if you think he was the only baby who ever wanted to escape it shows how completely you have forgotten your own young days when david heard this story first he was quite certain that he had never tried to escape but i told him to think back hard pressing his hands to his temples and when he had done this hard and even harder he distinctly remembered a youthful desire to return to the and with that memory came others as that he had lain in bed planning to escape as soon as his mother was asleep and how she had once caught him up the chimney all children could have such recollections if they would press their hands hard to their temples for having been birds before they were human they are naturally a little wild during the first few weeks and very itchy at the shoulders where their wings used to be so david tells me i ought to mention here that the following is our way with a story first i tell it to him and then he tells it to me the understanding being that it is quite a different story and then i retell it with his additions and so we go on until no one could say whether it is more his story or mine in this story of peter pan for instance the bald narrative and most of the moral reflections are mine though not all for this boy can be a stern moralist but the interesting bits about the ways and customs of babies in the are mostly reminiscences of recalled by pressing his hands to his temples and thinking hard well peter pan got out by the window which had no bars standing on the ledge he could see trees far away which were doubtless the kensington gardens and the moment he saw them he entirely forgot that he was now a little boy in a nightgown and away he flew right over the houses to the gardens it is wonderful that he could fly without wings but the place itched tremendously and perhaps we could all fly if we were as of our capacity to do it as was bold peter pan that evening he alighted gaily on the open sward between the palace and the serpentine and the first thing he did was to lie on his back and kick he was quite unaware already that he had ever been human and thought he was a bird even in appearance just the same as in his early days and when he tried to catch a fly he did not understand that the reason he missed it was because he had attempted to seize it with his hand which of course a bird never does he saw however that it must be past time for there were a good many fairies about all too busy to notice him they were getting breakfast ready milking their cows drawing water and so on and the sight of the made him thirsty so he flew over to the round pond to have a drink he stooped and dipped his beak in the pond he thought it was his beak but of course it was only his nose and therefore very little water came up and that not so refreshing as usual so next he tried a puddle and he fell flop into it when a real bird falls in flop he spreads out his feathers and pecks them dry but peter could not remember what was the thing to do and he decided rather sulkily to go to sleep on the weeping beech in the baby walk chapter they fought like brave men long and well they piled that ground with moslem slain they conquered but bozzaris fell bleeding at every vein his few surviving comrades saw his smile when rang their loud hurrah and the red field was won then saw in death his eyelids close calmly as to a night's repose like flowers at set of sun halleck the sun found the lenape on the succeeding day a nation of mourners the sounds of the battle were over and they had fed fat their ancient grudge and had avenged their recent quarrel with the mengwe by the destruction of a whole community the black and murky atmosphere that floated around the spot where the hurons had encamped sufficiently announced of itself the fate of that wandering tribe while hundreds of ravens that struggled above the summits of the mountains or swept in noisy flocks across the wide ranges of the woods furnished a frightful direction to the scene of the combat in short any eye at all practised in the signs of a frontier warfare might easily have traced all those unerring evidences of the ruthless results which attend an indian vengeance still the sun rose on the lenape a nation of mourners no shouts of success no songs of triumph were heard in rejoicings for their victory the latest straggler had returned from his fell employment only to strip himself of the terrific emblems of his bloody calling and to join in the lamentations of his countrymen as a stricken people pride and exultation were supplanted by humility and the fiercest of human passions was already succeeded by the most profound and unequivocal demonstrations of grief the lodges were deserted but a broad belt of earnest faces encircled a spot in their vicinity whither everything possessing life had repaired and where all were now collected in deep and awful silence though beings of every rank and age of both sexes and of all pursuits had united to form this breathing wall of bodies they were influenced by a single emotion each eye was riveted on the center of that ring which contained the objects of so much and of so common an interest six delaware girls with their long dark flowing tresses falling loosely across their bosoms stood apart and only gave proof of their existence as they occasionally strewed herbs and forest flowers on a litter of fragrant plants that under a pall of indian robes supported all that now remained of the ardent and generous cora her form was concealed in many wrappers of the same simple manufacture and her face was shut forever from the gaze of men at her feet was seated the desolate munro his aged head was bowed nearly to the earth in compelled submission to the stroke of providence but a hidden anguish struggled about his furrowed brow that was only partially concealed by the careless locks of gray that had fallen neglected on his temples gamut stood at his side his meek head bared to the rays of the sun while his eyes wandering and concerned seemed to be equally divided between that little volume which contained so many quaint but holy maxims and the being in whose behalf his soul yearned to administer consolation heyward was also nigh supporting himself against a tree and endeavoring to keep down those sudden risings of sorrow that it required his utmost manhood to subdue but sad and melancholy as this group may easily be imagined it was far less touching than another that occupied the opposite space of the same area seated as in life with his form and limbs arranged in grave and decent composure uncas appeared arrayed in the most gorgeous ornaments that the wealth of the tribe could furnish rich plumes nodded above his head wampum gorgets bracelets and medals adorned his person in profusion though his dull eye and vacant lineaments too strongly contradicted the idle tale of pride they would convey directly in front of the corpse chingachgook was placed without arms paint or adornment of any sort except the bright blue blazonry of his race that was indelibly impressed on his naked bosom during the long period that the tribe had thus been collected the mohican warrior had kept a steady anxious look on the cold and senseless countenance of his son so riveted and intense had been that gaze and so changeless his attitude that a stranger might not have told the living from the dead but for the occasional gleamings of a troubled spirit that shot athwart the dark visage of one and the deathlike calm that had forever settled on the lineaments of the other the scout was hard by leaning in a pensive posture on his own fatal and avenging weapon while tamenund supported by the elders of his nation occupied a high place at hand whence he might look down on the mute and sorrowful assemblage of his people just within the inner edge of the circle stood a soldier in the military attire of a strange nation and without it was his warhorse in the center of a collection of mounted domestics seemingly in readiness to undertake some distant journey the vestments of the stranger announced him to be one who held a responsible situation near the person of the captain of the canadas and who as it would now seem finding his errand of peace frustrated by the fierce impetuosity of his allies was content to become a silent and sad spectator of the fruits of a contest that he had arrived too late to anticipate chapter iii the dick jennings the was one of the few northern men who go to the south and throw aside their honest mode of obtaining a living and resort to trading in human beings a more person could scarcely be found in any community of bad looking men tall lean and lank with high face much pitted with the gray eyes with red eyebrows and sandy whiskers he indeed stood alone without mate or fellow in looks jennings prided himself upon what he called his goodness of heat and was always speaking of his humanity as many of the slaves whom he intended taking to the new orleans market had been raised in richmond and had relations there he determined to leave the city early in the morning so as not to witness any of the scenes so common on the departure of a to the far south in this he was most successful for not even isabella who had called at the prison several times to see her mother and sister was aware of the time that they were to leave the started at early dawn and was beyond the confines of the city long before the citizens were out of their beds as a slave regards a life on the sugar cotton or rice plantation as even worse than death they are ever on the watch for an opportunity to escape the trader aware of this secures his victims in chains before he sets out on his journey on this occasion jennings had the men chained in pairs while the women were allowed to go unfastened but were closely watched after a march of eight days the company arrived on the banks of the ohio river where they took a steamer for the place of their destination jennings had already advertised in the new orleans papers that he would be there with a prime lot of slaves men and women fit for with a few extra ones calculated for all between the ages of fifteen and years but like most men who make a business of speculating in human beings he often bought many who were far advanced in years and would try to pass them off for five or six years younger than they were few persons can arrive at anything approaching the real age of the negro by mere observation unless they are well acquainted with the race therefore the frequently carried out the deception with perfect impunity after the steamer had left the wharf and was fairly out on the bosom of the broad mississippi the speculator called his servant pompey to him and instructed him as to getting the negroes ready for market among the forty slaves that the trader had on this occasion were some whose appearance indicated that they had seen some years and had gone through considerable service their gray hair and whiskers at once pronounced them to be above the ages set down in the trader's advertisement pompey had long been with jennings and understood his business well and if he did not take delight in the discharge of his duty he did it at least with a degree of alacrity so that he might receive the approbation of his master pomp as he was usually called by the trader was of real negro blood and would often say when alluding to himself dis nigger am no counterfeit he is de ginuine artikle dis chile is none of your dere is no bogus about him pompey was of low stature round face and like most of his race had a set of teeth which for whiteness and beauty could not be surpassed his eyes were large lips thick and hair short and woolly pompey had been with jennings so long and had seen so much of buying and selling of his that he appeared perfectly indifferent to the scenes which daily occurred in his presence such is the force of habit vice is a monster of such frightful mien that to be hated needs but to be seen but seen too oft familiar with its face we first endure then pity then embrace it was on the second day of the steamer's voyage that pompey selected five of the oldest slaves took them into a room by themselves and commenced preparing them for the market now said he addressing himself to the company i is de chap dat is to get you ready for de orleans market so dat you will bring marser a good price how old is you addressing himself to a man not less than forty if i live to see next time i shall be either forty or i don't know which dat may be replied pompey but now you is only thirty years old dat's what marser says you is to be i know i is more den dat responded the man i can't help nuffin about dat returned pompey but when you get into de market and any one ax you how old you is and you tell um you is forty or marser will tie you up and cut you all to pieces but if you tell um dat you is only thirty den he won't now remember dat you is thirty years old and no more prologue on june alexander spotswood governor of the colony of virginia and a gallant soldier who had served under marlborough in the english wars rode at the head of a dauntless band of cavaliers down the quiet street of quaint old williamsburg the adventurous spirits of this party of men urged them toward the land of the setting sun that unknown west far beyond the blue crested mountains rising so grandly before them months afterward they stood on the western range of the great north mountains towering above the picturesque shenandoah valley and from the summit of one of the loftiest peaks where until then the foot of a white man had never trod they viewed the vast expanse of plain and forest with glistening eyes returning to williamsburg they told of the wonderful richness of the newly discovered country and thus opened the way for the venturesome pioneer who was destined to overcome all difficulties and make a home in the western world but fifty years and more passed before a white man penetrated far beyond the purple spires of those majestic mountains one bright morning in june the figure of a stalwart broad shouldered man could have been seen standing on the wild and rugged promontory which rears its rocky bluff high above the ohio river at a point near the mouth of wheeling creek he was alone save for the companionship of a deerhound that crouched at his feet as he leaned on a long rifle contemplating the glorious scene that stretched before him a smile flashed across his bronzed cheek and his heart bounded as he forecast the future of that spot in the river below him lay an island so round and green that it resembled a huge lily pad floating placidly on the water the fresh green foliage of the trees sparkled with glittering dewdrops back of him rose the high ridges and in front as far as eye could reach extended an unbroken forest beneath him to the left and across a deep ravine he saw a wide level clearing the few scattered and blackened tree stumps showed the ravages made by a forest fire in the years gone by the field was now overgrown with hazel and laurel bushes and intermingling with them were the trailing arbutus the honeysuckle and the wild rose a fragrant perfume was wafted upward to him a rushing creek bordered one edge of the clearing after a long quiet reach of water which could be seen winding back in the hills the stream tumbled madly over a rocky ledge and white with foam it hurried onward as if impatient of long restraint and lost its individuality in the broad ohio this solitary hunter was colonel ebenezer zane he was one of those daring men who as the tide of emigration started westward had left his friends and family and had struck out alone into the wilderness departing from his home in eastern virginia he had plunged into the woods and after many days of hunting and exploring he reached the then far western ohio valley the scene so impressed colonel zane that he concluded to found a settlement there taking tomahawk possession of the locality which consisted of blazing a few trees with his tomahawk he built himself a rude shack and remained that summer on the ohio in the autumn he set out for berkeley county virginia to tell his people of the magnificent country he had discovered the following spring he persuaded a number of settlers of a like spirit with himself to accompany him to the wilderness believing it unsafe to take their families with them at once they left them at red stone on the monongahela river while the men including colonel zane his brothers silas andrew jonathan and isaac the wetzels mccollochs bennets metzars and others pushed on ahead the country through which they passed was one tangled most impenetrable forest the axe of the pioneer had never sounded in this region where every rod of the way might harbor some unknown danger these reckless bordermen knew not the meaning of fear to all daring adventure was welcome and the screech of a redskin and the ping of a bullet were familiar sounds to the wetzels mccollochs and jonathan zane the hunting of indians was the most thrilling passion of their lives indeed the wetzels particularly knew no other occupation they had attained a wonderful skill with the rifle long practice had rendered their senses as acute as those of the fox skilled in every variety of woodcraft with lynx eyes ever on the alert for detecting a trail or the curling smoke of some camp fire or the minutest sign of an enemy these men stole onward through the forest with the cautious but dogged and persistent determination that was characteristic of the settler they at length climbed the commanding bluff overlooking the majestic river and as they gazed out on the undulating and uninterrupted area of green their hearts beat high with hope the keen axe wielded by strong arms soon opened the clearing and reared stout log cabins on the river bluff then ebenezer zane and his followers moved their families and soon the settlement began to grow and flourish as the little village commenced to prosper the redmen became troublesome settlers were shot while plowing the fields or gathering the harvests bands of hostile indians prowled around and made it dangerous for anyone to leave the clearing frequently the first person to appear in the early morning would be shot at by an indian concealed in the woods a night trip taking a lesson from what had happened tom was very much more careful in the following experiments on his new silent motor he made some changes in his shop and took jackson in to help on the new machine thus insuring perfect secrecy as the apparatus developed tom also changed the safe in which he kept his plans for the one he had used previous to the episode in which bower and the stranger who took the mud bath figured was one the combination of which could easily be ascertained by an expert the new safe was more complicated and tom felt that his plans specifications and formulae which he had worked out were in less danger i can just about figure out what happened said ned newton to tom when told of the circumstances these universal people were provoked because you wouldn't give them the benefit of your experience on their flying machines and so they sent a spy to get work with you they perhaps hoped to secure some of your ideas for their own or they may have had a deeper motive what deeper motive could they have ned they might have hoped to disable you or some of your machines so that you couldn't compete with them they're unscrupulous i hear and will do anything to succeed and make money so be on your guard against them i will tom promised but i don't believe there's any more danger now anyhow i have to take some chances yes but be as careful as you can how is the silent motor coming on pretty good i've had a lot of failures and the thing isn't so easy as i at first imagined it would be noise is a funny thing and i'm just beginning to understand some of the laws of acoustics we learned at high school but i think i'm on the right track with the muffler and the cutting down of the noise of the explosions in the cylinders i'm working both ends you see making a motor that doesn't cause as much racket as those now in use and also providing means to take care of the noise that is made it isn't possible to make a completely silent motor of an explosive gas type the only thing that can be done is to kill the noise after it is made what about the propeller blades oh they aren't giving me any trouble the noise they make can't be heard a hundred feet in the air but i am also working on improvements to the blades take it altogether i'll have an almost silent aeroplane if my plans come out all right have you said anything to the government yet no i want to have it pretty well perfected before i do besides i don't want any publicity about it until i'm ready if these universal people are after me i'll fool em that's right tom well i must go another week of this liberty bond campaign i suppose you'll be glad when it's over well i don't know said ned slowly it's part of my small contribution to uncle sam i'm not like you i can't invent things but you have an awful smooth line of talk ned laughed his chum i believe you could sell chloride of sodium to some of the fishes in the great salt lake that is if it has fishes i don't know that it has tom and anyhow i'm not posing as a salt salesman and ned grinned but i must really go our bank hasn't reached its quota in the sale of liberty bonds yet and it's up to me to see that it doesn't fall down go to it ned and i'll get busy on my silent motor getting busy was tom swift's favorite occupation and when he was working on a new idea as was the case now he was seldom idle night or day i have hardly seen you for two weeks mary nestor wrote him one day aren't you ever coming to see me any more or take me for a ride yes tom wrote back i'll be over soon and perhaps on the next ride we take i won't have to shout at you through a speaking tube because the motor makes so much noise from this it may be gathered that tom was on the verge of success while not altogether satisfied with his progress the young inventor felt that he was on the right track there were certain changes that needed to be made in the apparatus he was building certain refinements that must be added and when this should be done tom was pretty certain that he would have what would prove to be a very quiet aeroplane if not an absolutely silent one the young inventor was engaged one day with some of the last details of the experiment the new motor with the silencer and the changed cylinders had been attached to one of tom's speedy aeroplanes and he was making some intricate calculations in relation to a new cylinder block to be used when he started to make a completely new machine of the improved type tom had set down on paper some computations regarding the of one of the cylinders and was working out the amount of stress to which he could subject a shoulder strut when a shadow was cast across the drawing board he had propped up in his lap part ii in point of fact as percy beaumont would have said mrs westgate disembarked on the of may on the british coast she was accompanied by her sister but she was not attended by any other member of her family to the deprivation of her society mrs westgate was however habituated she had made half a dozen journeys to europe without him and she now accounted for his absence to interrogative friends on this side of the atlantic by allusion to the regrettable but conspicuous fact that in america there was no leisure class the two ladies came up to london and alighted at hotel where mrs westgate who had made on former occasions the most agreeable impression at this establishment received an obsequious greeting bessie alden had felt much excited about coming to england she had expected the associations would be very charming that it would be an infinite pleasure to rest her eyes upon the things she had read about in the poets and historians she was very fond of the poets and historians of the picturesque of the past of retrospect of mementos and reverberations of greatness so that on coming into the english world where strangeness and familiarity would go hand in hand she was prepared for a multitude of fresh emotions they began very promptly these tender fluttering sensations they began with the sight of the beautiful english landscape whose dark richness was quickened and brightened by the season with the carpeted fields and flowering hedgerows as she looked at them from the window of the train with the spires of the rural churches peeping above the treetops with the parks the ancient homes the cloudy light the speech the manners the thousand differences mrs impressions had of course much less novelty and keenness and she gave but a wandering attention to her ejaculations and rhapsodies you know my enjoyment of england is not so intellectual as she said to several of her friends in the course of her visit to this country and yet if it is not intellectual i say it is physical i think i can quite say what it is my enjoyment of england when once it was settled that the two ladies should come abroad and should spend a few weeks in england on their way to the continent they of course exchanged a good many allusions to their london acquaintance it will certainly be much nicer having friends there bessie alden had said one day as she sat on the sunny deck of the steamer at her feet on a large blue rug whom do you mean by friends mrs westgate asked all those english gentlemen whom you have known and entertained captain littledale for instance and lord lambeth and mr beaumont added bessie alden do you expect them to give us a very grand reception bessie reflected a moment she was addicted as we know to reflection well yes my poor sweet child murmured her sister what have i said that is so silly asked bessie you are a little too simple just a little it is very becoming but it pleases people at your expense i am certainly too simple to understand you said bessie shall i tell you a story asked her sister if you would be so good that is what they do to amuse simple people mrs westgate consulted her memory while her companion sat gazing at the shining sea did you ever hear of the duke of i think not said bessie well no matter her sister went on a proof of my simplicity my story is meant to illustrate that of some other people said mrs westgate the duke of is what they call in england a great swell and some five years ago he came to america he spent most of his time in new york and in new york he spent his days and his nights at the butterworths you have heard at least of the butterworths bien they did everything in the world for him they turned themselves inside out they gave him a dozen dinner parties and balls and were the means of his being invited to fifty more at first he used to come into mrs box at the opera in a tweed traveling suit but someone stopped that at any rate he had a beautiful time and they parted the best friends in the world two years elapse and the butterworths come abroad and go to london the first thing they see in all the papers in england those things are in the most prominent place is that the duke of has arrived in town for the season they wait a little and then mr butterworth as polite as ever goes and leaves a card they wait a little more the visit is not returned they wait three weeks silence de mort the duke gives no sign the butterworths see a lot of other people put down the duke of as a rude ungrateful man and forget all about him one fine day they go to ascot races and there they meet him face to face he stares a moment and then comes up to mr butterworth taking something from his pocketbook something which proves to be a banknote glad to see you mr butterworth he says so that i can pay you that ten pounds i lost to you in new york i saw the other day you remembered our bet here are the ten pounds mr butterworth goodbye mr butterworth and off he goes and the last they see of the duke of
