General-use Next Word Prediction model using a Bidirectional LSTM architecture that takes a phrase of words as input and generates predictions of the next word. The model is trained using text data from [AMALGUM](https://github.com/gucorpling/amalgum) to predict the most likely next word given an input phrase.
